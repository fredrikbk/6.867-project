why opec idles as gas prices reach new highs cartel blames refiners cites flush oil supplies tug of war over profits two years ago when gasoline prices in the u s surged to the then lofty level of &# a gallon the organization of petroleum exporting countries sprang into action seeking to provide relief by pledging to boost oil production now with gasoline topping an average of &# a gallon nationwide opec officials say they see no reason to open the oil spigot wider opecs new attitude reflects a tug of war in the global oil patch over how the profits from a barrel of oil are divvied up between the worlds producers which develop oil deposits and pump oil and its refiners which process it into fuels like gasoline in recent years the balance in the worlds oil supply system has shifted giving the refining industry more power and more profit this time opec says the world has ample oil supplies the cartels members contend gasoline prices have climbed particularly fast in the u s because refining capacity is tight imports from europe are down and u s inventories have tumbled "the crude oil market is well balanced right now " one senior opec official said yesterday echoing remarks by ali naimi the saudi oil minister earlier this month in riyadh "the market is well supplied and inventories are at good levels " the official said he and others in opec say they arent about to dump more crude on world markets in what might be a futile effort to drive down gasoline prices opec president mohamed bin dhaen al hamli who is also the oil minister of the united arab emirates and other ministers have expressed similar views in recent days the group is scheduled to formally consider its oil output levels at a meeting in vienna on sept opecs tough stance on production shows how much the industry landscape has changed in two years in opec officials particularly the saudis fretted that the surge in energy prices would hurt the world economy encourage development of alternative energy sources and create political frictions with other nations to calm nervous global energy markets the group committed to boost production in an april meeting with president bush in crawford texas saudi arabias king abdullah then crown prince took pains to detail a massive &# billion push by the kingdom to increase its oil production capacity opecs action was credited in part for a subsequent drop in gasoline prices prices eased that spring in the u s the worlds largest gasoline market before picking up again during the summer and peaking after hurricanes katrina and rita devastated oil production and refining facilities in the gulf of mexico temporarily knocking out a quarter of the u s s refining capacity since then energy prices have kept climbing and the world economy has kept growing indeed opec is citing projections that the global economy will expand at an inflation adjusted rate of in despite higher energy costs but while crude oil prices on the new york mercantile exchange have risen so far this year gasoline prices have surged privately opec members are irked that u s refining margins the profit refiners make in turning crude into gasoline and other products have soared in recent months lately american refiners have made a pretax profit of roughly &# on each barrel of oil they use to produce gasoline more than three times the margin in singapore a major asian refining center opec officials say that if they pump more oil and depress world oil prices u s gasoline prices might remain high and the result would be even wider refining margins in essence opec would be putting more money into the pockets of refiners while its own revenue would be hurt by declining crude prices refiners counter that opec has played a big role in pushing up gasoline prices rayola dougher senior economic analyst at api the trade group formerly known as the american petroleum institute says about cents of the &# a gallon increase in gasoline prices since mid january is due to a cut in oil output by opec last fall and the resulting higher oil prices she attributes the rest of the run up to a decline in gasoline imports and to glitches at refineries in the u s at a time when they are usually building up their inventories to prepare for the summer driving season stable demand has also put upward pressure on prices the price of regular gasoline shot up cents in just the past month to &# a gallon according to auto club aaa but americans havent cut back much on their driving despite their complaints about high prices the u s which imports nearly of its oil cant make enough gasoline it needs at home it relies on imports for about of its supply and routinely imports the fuel from europe but tight gasoline supplies in europe have kept the u s from buying as much as it would like from across the atlantic according to the u s department of energy u s gasoline demand so far this year is up around at million barrels a day inventories however have fallen as of may the u s had million barrels of gasoline on hand million barrels less than a year ago thats partly because the nations refiners are using less of their capacity than they were a year ago due to planned outages for maintenance and some caused by power outages and equipment failures among other factors it also reflects the shortfall in gasoline imports opec began cutting its crude production last fall after prices for oil eased to close to &# a barrel as a result of the cuts oil prices quickly rose again yesterday oil closed at &# a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange down &# in london brent crude which has gained increasing prominence as a benchmark for oil prices rose cents to &# a barrel oil prices and gasoline prices could climb further this summer for a variety of reasons ranging from supply interruptions in producer nations like nigeria to hurricanes in the gulf of mexico where many u s refineries are located roger diwan an analyst at pfc energy a washington based energy consulting company says he expects "price spikes this summer in gasoline and crude oil " if prices rise to &# a barrel above the previous peak of slightly more than &# a barrel last summer opec is likely to become worried again about the fallout "they are always concerned when prices reach new highs " mr diwan said corrections &amp amplifications u s gasoline demand in may is up around from a year earlier a page one article friday incorrectly said that gasoline demand so far this year is up around wsj may
