politics &amp economics senate pushes utilities on green sources proposal to require significant increase has broad support washington the campaign to get more energy from renewable sources has moved to the u s energy grid part of a broader effort aimed at weaning the nation off fossil fuels a bill about to be introduced in the senate would push utilities to generate drastically more of their power compared with the current from sources such as wind or the sun by while three similar measures have died after passing the senate this one has powerful bipartisan support environmental groups have long sought a federal law requiring utilities to use a variety of cleaner natural resources several states already direct utilities to meet minimum standards a federal benchmark could give utilities a uniform interstate market and make compliance easier the drive is complicated by feasibility questions though and by splits among supporters over which alternatives are desirable coal state lawmakers for one argue that the focus on renewable fuels is misplaced they say carbon dioxide emissions which scientists believe accelerate climate change could be reduced more effectively by getting more power from nuclear plants and coal fired plants that bury their carbon dioxide emissions "it seems to me to make more sense to give utilities maximum flexibility " says virginia rep rick boucher democratic chairman of the energy and commerce subcommittee that handles most energy legislation mr boucher who represents virginias main coal producing regions doesnt plan to take up house versions of the legislation the senate proposal authored by sen jeff bingaman the new mexico democrat who is chairman of the committee on energy and natural resources defines renewable energy sources as wind solar geothermal wood chips and other biofuels as well as various ways to make energy from tides and ocean waves his measure mandates what are called "renewable portfolios standards " it wouldnt pre empt the states that have widely differing standards it would apply to those that dont have such requirements and would raise the mandate on utilities in states whose standards dont meet the threshold marchant wentworth a lobbyist for the union of concerned scientists an environmental group based in cambridge mass is confident a coalition including republican moderates and conservative democrats will prevail in the house despite mr bouchers reservations "there is more support in the house than weve ever seen " he says noting that the bill has co sponsors iowa in was the first state to require utilities to use renewable fuels today what states consider "renewable" varies widely but the main result of the mandates according to ryan wiser a scientist at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley calif has been an increase in wind generated electricity so far state laws which cover of the u s population havent made a big difference the percentage of renewable fuels used in the u s has hovered from to in recent years and will reach only by when most of the state standards are fully phased in dr wiser estimates state laws have raised the average consumers utility bill by cents a month "clearly if you want to expand renewable fuels something has to be done beyond this " he says backers of the bingaman legislation think the bill could do the trick the measure would authorize the department of energy to set up a national market to trade what are called renewable energy certificates which would be created and sold by producers of a certain amount of renewable energy utilities that generate more wind power than they need to meet the renewable energy standard could sell credits to utilities in areas without much wind and these utilities could use the credits to meet the standard at the end of the year the utilities that still dont meet the standard would face a civil penalty some states use credits now but interstate trading is limited because of differences among state policies the bingaman measure would require the government to develop a nationwide credit "one of the key virtues of a national system is that it would provide pressure to develop renewables in a least costly fashion " says blair swezey a policy adviser at the department of energys national renewable energy laboratory utilities are split on the idea jason cuevas a spokesman for southern co the atlanta based giant that markets power in florida georgia alabama and mississippi says his company isnt enthusiastic southern figures that it can produce some renewable energy from burning wood chips and certain types of grasses but that the region cant produce enough wind or solar power to meet a federal mandate so it would have to buy as much as &# billion of certificates "these are checks that we would have to ask our customers to write " he said adding that southern officials think the money would be better spent working on ways to inject carbon dioxide emissions from coal fired plants into the ground or building nuclear power plants frank prager director of environmental policy for xcel energy inc of minneapolis which sells natural gas and electricity in eight western and midwestern states says his company originally fought state requirements on renewable energy sources but now likes them "we found they havent been as difficult to comply with as we feared and using more wind is a no brainer " he said "it comes into our resource plans anyway "
