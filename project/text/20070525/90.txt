the wijffels waffle it hasnt been two weeks since a special committee of the world bank board accused paul wolfowitz of ethical violations in giving a raise to his girlfriend charges later repudiated by the larger board now the head of that committee dutchman herman wijffels has admitted that the ethics charges were just an alibi to force mr wolfowitz to resign all this underscores what an exercise in european cynicism this world bank putsch was from beginning to end "if he had otherwise been a good leader this may not have come so far " mr wijffels told the dutch newspaper de volkskrant adding that mr wolfowitz had never developed a "coherent strategy" for the bank "i attempted to talk to him about it but he wasnt interested " translation paul wolfowitz didnt appreciate my brilliance so i arranged his overthrow based on trumped up charges no wonder mr wijffels never reconciled to mr wolfowitzs anti corruption strategy applying regulations selectively to reach the preferred political result seems to be the dutchmans specialty in his interview mr wijffels dismissed the suggestion that his actions might have adverse consequences for u s dutch relations we suspect hes wrong if nothing else the wolfowitz saga has dissuaded the bush administration from allowing a european to take the helm of the bank for the banks sake as well as for americas lets hope the next president will be even less to mr wijffelss liking than mr wolfowitz
