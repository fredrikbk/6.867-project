cross country buffalos field of dreams buffalo n y my hometown is probably best known as a city that people like to leave since buffalo has lost almost of its population and in some parts the exodus has created a landscape that resembles scenes from the post apocalyptic thriller "escape from new york " as kids my brother and i would explore the citys ruins venturing into crumbling train terminals and abandoned factories where moss carpeted floors rainwater gushed down empty hallways and peeling wallpaper rustled in the wind buffalo does have a number of stunning neighborhoods lined with stately old mansions and interspersed with thickly wooded parks designed by frederick law olmsted and the population of the buffalo metro area hasnt declined even so the city is the second poorest major urban area in the nation just behind detroit nearly half of the citys children live in poverty you can imagine my surprise to hear that buffalos salvation is at hand and that its savior is a year old developer of iraqi descent named bashar issa mr issa it was said had decided to build a gleaming new skyscraper in buffalo that would be one of the tallest structures between new york and chicago mr issa born in kuwait is the son of an iraqi father and a kuwaiti mother his parents sent him to england during the first gulf war and he has lived there since he went to the university of london and in his spare time began restoring homes and selling them for a profit he proved adept and was soon buying old banks and warehouses and converting them to high end hotels and condominiums his parents gave him a little bit of seed money but he has expanded his capital exponentially how did buffalo catch mr issas eye one winter night around two in the morning mr issa was at home in manchester england surfing the web when he came across real estate listings that looked interesting the buildings were grand beautiful and cheap and in a curious city in the western corner of new york state he did what a brash impulsive something financier with money to burn is prone to do he hopped a plane found a local realtor walked into the dilapidated remains of the citys grandest old hotel the statler and within seconds was sold mr issa is now refurbishing the statler and making plans to build a skyscraper the buffalo city tower which will stand stories tall offer million square feet of floor space and cost a cool &# million hes waiting to find an anchor tenant before breaking ground the responses to mr issas initiatives have been nothing short of jubilant "he is treated like the messiah here " says mark goldman a businessman and historian who has written two well respected books on buffalo "he gives a little talk and people show up " newell nussbaumer editor of buffalo rising an alternative monthly calls mr issa the citys "superhero " mayor byron brown also gets carried away "here you have a well financed businessperson from manchester england who is saying in major way that buffalo is worth investing in " he told me "when someone like that makes those kinds of investments people all over the world sit up and take notice " but can mr issa find commercial tenants his strategy is to convince major companies in new york and toronto to move their back offices and call centers to buffalo where salaries office space and nearly everything else is cheaper its a compelling idea after all why send labor to india when buffalo is closer english speaking and inexpensive mayor brown is especially bullish about this strategy he notes that mr issa has been "extremely successful" in convincing the bbc to move some of its offices from london to manchester unfortunately this isnt exactly right it is true that mr issa belongs to a group of developers known as piccadilly partnership and some of these developers have lured the bbc and other businesses out of london but this isnt something that mr issa has done personally none of the high rises mr issa owns in manchester are office buildings they are all residential facilities he has far less experience with "back office" dealings the mayor is hoping mr issa is the right man in the right place at the right time and mr issa may succeed he is smart charismatic and well funded buffalo also has a great deal to offer including a well educated workforce a world class university an exquisite housing stock and a low cost of living the city even has a number of grassroots activists like my friend aaron bartley a harvard law school graduate who launched a citywide effort to salvage abandoned houses and fill them with new immigrants and other aspiring homeowners the danger is that buffalos optimism regarding mr issa will become a kind of clinging desperate hope this hard luck city is always looking for redemption redemption from poverty from four straight super bowl losses from the loss of the steel mills from the bad stereotypes about the weather and from the opportunists who like myself move away from the city in its hour of need this need makes someone like mr issa more appealing because it casts him as a hero in the classic american storyline hes the sheriff sauntering into town who in john wayne like fashion will restore justice dignity and prosperity the problem is that waiting for a john wayne figure can create complacency and obscure the reality that redemption will not come easily or at once in the form of deus ex machina the best thing the mayor could do now is forget about mr issa and focus on the daily grind of improving schools creating tax incentives for businesses and even filling potholes the unglamorous minutiae of city life that will truly pave the road to redemption mr halpern is the author of "fame junkies" houghton mifflin which will be published in paperback this month see related letter "letters to the editor buffalos tune has more than just one note" wsj dec
