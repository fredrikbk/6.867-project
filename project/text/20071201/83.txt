weekend journal entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies small film big heart once is one of several little movies that won crowds over this year never underestimate the power of a little movie the point was brought home recently when the co stars of "once " glen hansard and marketa irglova did a live show at the wiltern theater a grand old art deco landmark in los angeles the two were more than co stars of course as dublin street singers dubbed only guy and girl they were the bodies and soul of a lovely wisp of a film that runs minutes and cost all of &# to make yet that wisp had launched them on an international tour and here they were playing to a full house of adoring fans who couldnt get enough of the soaring songs that had given "once" its shape and substance both musicians had loyal followings before the films release to be sure one could also argue that the vehicle of their wider fame was a special case not so much a conventional movie as a felicitous container for those songs still "once" is special for other reasons as well its one of several little movies released this year that audiences took to their hearts with an intensity and devotion seldom lavished on larger productions when big heavily promoted productions "american gangster " for example live up to our expectations were delighted and excited as we should be when a terrific little feature comes out of nowhere though a film like "lars and the real girl " or "waitress" we feel grateful and intensely protective as if its our personal treasure that no one else appreciates fully one reason for this is clear the emotional impact of such films hasnt been diluted by relentless input from marketing departments the conventional unwisdom of focus groups or the solipsistic concerns of powerful stars but a less obvious reason has to do with something ill call the size to content ratio a notion that came into focus for me as i listened to glen hansard at the wiltern theater concert mr hansard is a force of lyrical irish nature with a huge passionate voice that filled the cavernous auditorium as live performances go his was powerful and memorable it put you in mind of bruce springsteens volcanic energy to my surprise however the show made me appreciate and actively miss the magical intimacy with which mr hansard sings many of the same songs in "once" not shaking the rafters with them but revealing them delicately at first then releasing them in a performance thats made to seem all the more powerful dramatically as well as musically by the small scale of the film that surrounds it yet cant contain it small doesnt guarantee good any more than big equates with bad im as open as anyone to the pleasures of rock em sock em hollywood productions when they have pleasure to dispense this year in addition to "american gangster " i recommended "live free or die hard" and "beowulf " some readers were less happy than i with the latter one guy all but demanded that i refund the &# he spent on tickets nevertheless a look back at my reviews theres nothing like reading your own stuff to find out what you think reminds me how much the size to content ratio matters i love little films with lots in them the same look back reveals dismayingly that hardly a single american film worth seeing opened during the first three months of this year is this any way to run an entertainment business the little films i care about are not just those that touch your heart in the way that the late adrienne shellys "waitress" does the memory of keri russells gallant pie baker still lingers waiting to be refreshed by the dvd or that make you smile with surprise as "lars and the real girl" does when it opens up from a seemingly cheesy premise into a singular comic fantasy about the possibility of kindness in a hard edged world susanne biers danish language drama "after the wedding" has the density and dimension of a white dwarf star unlike the same gifted directors overblown american debut "things we lost in the fire" david cronenbergs taut compact thriller "eastern promises" seethes with menace explodes with sporadic violence serves as a showcase for one of the years best performances viggo mortensens soulful russian thug and as if all that werent enough summons up a richly detailed world of eastern european intrigue in london then theres a gorgeous little comedy called "juno " about which i can say nothing specific until it opens in theaters on wednesday what can be said about "juno" in general however is that it arrives without the dubious benefit of hype and delivers an abundance of goods that no one had reason to expect in other words its my kind of film morgensterns picks global visions with the advent of consumer level digital cameras that deliver near professional quality would be spielbergs and welleses are able to work outside the hollywood system though not necessarily to get distribution for decades though filmmakers in other lands have made small scale films as a matter of necessity here are three good ones signs of life the debut feature of werner herzog whose most recent film "rescue dawn " has just been released on dvd set on an isolated greek island during world war ii its the story of stroszek a soldier sent to the island to recuperate from his wounds as in such herzog films to come as "aguirre the wrath of god" and "grizzly man " tension builds to a hallucinatory degree the proximate causes here include heat and suspicious natives but only psychosis can explain stroszeks plan to kill his new greek wife and blow up an ammunition dump offside jafar panahis blithe political comedy will tell you more about contemporary iran in minutes than youre apt to learn through weeks of watching tv the heroines several young tehrani women are incorrigible soccer fans even though women are excluded from the nations stadiums after trying and failing to crash a world cup qualifying match against bahrain the women find themselves in a holding pen where most of the action takes place the movie makes no bones about its positions discrimination is stupid the authorities are idiotic and manages to be extremely entertaining in the process knife in the water for his remarkable first feature shot in poland roman polanski used black and white film three actors and a sailboat plus all the sky needed to fill the horizon the premise is simple a couple off for a weekend cruise invite a hitchhiker to join them predictably the two men compete for the womans favors shes played by a nonprofessional discovered at a municipal swimming pool but thats only one of the intricate frightening games that the trio plays out polanski who went on to direct "chinatown" and "rosemarys baby "
