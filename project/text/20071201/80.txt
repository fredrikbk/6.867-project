weekend journal books the tolstoys at home life on the writers estate as recorded by a camera toting countess song without words by leah bendavid val national geographic pages &# it is fortunate that count lev nikolayevich tolstoys country house and estate at yasnaya polyana near tula russia have been preserved appearing little changed nearly a century after his death although most visitors are drawn there by a desire to enter the home of leo tolstoy as the great novelist is known in the west they are also able to view a lonely survivor of those substantial manor houses that covered european russia before the russian revolution of tolstoys home was spared by a soviet regime that appropriated him as a precursor of marxist ideology an understandable desire for propaganda purposes though ludicrous in reality nothing could have been further from the ideology of the omnipotent socialist state than the authors eccentric mix of idealized anarchy pacifism and christological religion one can only be grateful though for this quirk of fate today the preservation and restoration of much of the estate and village is ably overseen by vladimir tolstoy the writers great great grandson the tolstoy house and its interior appear as though its extraordinary owner were about to walk out of the front door the tending of this shrine has been much assisted by the photographs of the estate from tolstoys lifetime many were taken by his devoted wife sophia sonia is the russian diminutive form who in bought a kodak camera with it she took hundreds of photographs of her husband herself their family they had children and innumerable visitors together with views of the house and grounds although her talent was not exceptional the pictures are of a high standard and provide an invaluable addition to the biographical understanding of tolstoy as man and writer "song without words the photographs and diaries of countess sophia tolstoy" is a handsomely produced volume that presents alongside text from the countesss diaries a selection of pictures many of great charm and nostalgic interest tolstoy himself naturally figures large among them looking decidedly stern and patriarchal this appearance is probably deceptive given his well attested sense of humor and liveliness and probably arises from the general th century aversion to that aimless grinning so characteristic of our own era tolstoy felt strongly that being photographed smacked of intolerable vanity complaining in "i suffered much when i had to be photographed for the th volume of my collected works i felt with all the vital part of my soul that i ought not to do it i humbled the pride which fills my whole being as wood fills the trunk of a tree and placed myself in front of the black eye of the camera " the images of the estate and surrounding countryside are particularly appealing showing the attractive house on its hill overlooking the estate and its ponds fields and forest there are lovely shots of the tolstoys walking in snowy woods standing by a lakeside bathing hut and playing tennis we see tolstoys granddaughter tania praying at her bedside accompanied by a kneeling row of devout dolls and we see the great man himself talking with chekhov visiting yalta and riding his beloved horse delir the diary quotations that accompany the pictures are aptly chosen the countess was a highly intelligent woman worthy of her husbands towering intellect as often as not she manifested the sort of good sense that the erratic genius of tolstoy was wont to abandon it would be hard to better this summary of her attitude toward religion "i dont understand religious discussions they destroy my own lofty relations with god which cannot be put into words there is no precise definition of eternity infinity and the afterlife just as there are no words to express my attitudes about the abstract indefinable infinite deity and my eternal life in god but i have no objection to the church with its ceremonies and its ikons i have lived amongst these things since i was a child when my soul was first drawn to god " leah bendavid val the editor of "song without words " has performed a signal service by making these photographs public for the first time but alas she has also added comments of her own that betray little understanding of russian history czar alexander iii certainly impeded reform following his fathers murder in but to write of his accession that it initiated "a wave of pogroms oppressive edicts against the jews and the establishment of a political police force the okhrana" is misleading such phrasing suggests that the pogroms were initiated by the government which is untrue in fact the okhrana long antedated alexander iii and one of its particular duties at the time was to prevent pogroms ms bendavid val also seems to have an unsteady grasp of tolstoy family history she describes the countess as anti semitic without providing evidence for the charge count tolstoy was not "an aristocrat who renounced his title " nor was there any reason why he should have done so following russian custom he used "count" on the title pages of his books up to his death in it is news to me that historians have "maligned" the countess and that the tolstoys marriage has been "labeled one of the worst in history " my impression is that the majority of historians regard them as a strong willed couple united almost as much by their differences as by their mutual bond of love and that she played an invaluable role in his literary achievements still "song without words" is very much worth lingering over sonias photographs and diary entries contribute mightily to our knowledge of her husband and the fact that the book makes them available to every tolstoy admirer is cause for celebration count tolstoy is the head of the senior branch of the tolstoy family his most recent book is "patrick obrian the making of the novelist " the first volume of a two volume biography of his late stepfather
