how zoe cruz lost her job on wall street morgan stanley official put blame on colleagues lost macks confidence zoe cruz appeared to be surviving the credit crisis that has roiled wall street but the morgan stanley co presidents response in the aftermath of the firms &# billion in losses helped fuel her ultimate fall the year old executive didnt take personal responsibility for the losses at morgan stanley according to people familiar with the firm and instead lashed out at fellow employees in a series of meetings about the losses raising questions about her management style as a result morgan stanley chief executive john mack lost confidence in ms cruz whom he had repeatedly backed in the face of opposition from senior executives these people say among other criticisms leveled at ms cruz she didnt have a good handle on the risks the firm took in its mammoth bond division a business she had grown up in and built over the years and she frequently clashed with well liked veteran investment banker robert scully often publicly correcting him at employee presentations she also pushed some big organizational changes that some executives thought of as arbitrary and ill informed this included a push to largely move the "swaps" group under the umbrella of morgan stanleys prime brokerage business catering to hedge funds swaps are a type of financial instrument whose value is tied to an underlying asset ms cruzs departure came abruptly the board met by telephone thursday and ms cruz learned of her ouster that afternoon other people said ms cruz couldnt be reached to comment and a morgan stanley spokesman said ms cruz wasnt commenting beyond a firm provided statement in a statement the securities firm said "zoes record of accomplishments over her years at morgan stanley speaks for itself she made enormous contributions to the firm and worked tirelessly to build and strengthen morgan stanleys global franchise " ms cruzs departure came after morgan stanley signaled possible fourth quarter losses those losses which one analyst estimated could swell by an additional &# billion by the time morgan stanley announces its results in mid december followed a series of hits totaling &# billion in the third quarter those included &# million of markdowns for leveraged loans a &# billion revenue decline reflecting mortgage assets and a &# million loss in quantitative stock trading asked about the stock trading losses in a presentation after the third quarter results ms cruz defended the traders saying they were world class and had made billions of dollars over the years indeed at the start of the summer morgan stanley gave the quantitative trading group more money to make stock market bets when the group suffered losses including &# million in a single day ms cruz and tom daula the firms chief risk officer pushed the group to take chips off the table people familiar with the situation say they believed their exposure was too great compared with other brokerage firms the people said but that move was questioned by some traders when those markets snapped back even before the mortgage trading losses surfaced ms cruzs leadership style was an issue some bankers and traders still resented her support for former ceo philip purcell who was ousted in after a campaign against him by a group of morgan stanley alumni after mr mack backed ms cruz upon his return to the firm he thought he could help ms cruz improve her management style and a personal coach was retained to work with her people familiar with the firm said but she didnt always display harmonious team work with her co president mr scully sometimes contradicting him in presentations mr scully was elevated to the office of the chairman thursday to work with high level clients including sovereign nations mr mack had already begun to develop two other potential successors walid chammah and james gorman by giving them "developmental assignments" long before he decided to oust ms cruz the two were named co presidents thursday earlier this year he shifted mr chammah then the investment banking chief to london to head morgan stanley europe ms cruz had pushed for the current international head jonathan chenevix trench to remain in the job more recently mr mack gave mr gorman who joined as head of the firms brokerage force in from merrill lynch &amp co a share of responsibility for firm wide strategy as for the mortgage losses themselves firm executives have previously described how a profitable bearish bet against subprime mortgage assets which earned &# billion in the first three quarters became a money loser holdings of super senior collateralized debt obligations or cdos which helped defray the interest costs of the bearish bet suddenly produced huge losses in the fourth quarter ms cruz was faulted internally for not having enough risk management executives reviewing the subprime bets another person familiar with the firm said ms cruz didnt encourage controversy and dissent and by the time the risk management group did highlight some problems and how the positions were working it was too late
