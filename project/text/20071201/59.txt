politics &amp economics lone star kick starts huckabee campaign it sounds like a bad tv plot a baptist minister and texas tough guy team up to take over iowa but as republican mike huckabee the minister continues to gain popularity in the iowa caucuses his endorsement by chuck norris the tough guy seems like yet another stroke of good luck mr norriss popularity especially among young males is fueled by a web site devoted to exaggerated accounts of his exploits chuck norris doesnt wear a watch by those accounts he decides what time it is mr huckabee is planning to keep that heroic aura close in the days leading up to the jan iowa caucuses as polls show him neck and neck with rival republican presidential candidate mitt romney who had been in the lead for some time in an interview the actor said hell campaign for the former arkansas governor in iowa on jan and and perhaps more "ill do whatever they want me to do " he said in an explanation that would make chuck norris fans grimace thats because in norris lore chuck norris does whatever he wants to do the odd alliance of mr norris whose film persona mows down enemies with roundhouse kicks and mr huckabee began when mr norris endorsed mr huckabee in an online column last month in a backhanded compliment mr norris opined that voters in the past have nominated leaders who are articulate and charismatic and might now consider choosing mr huckabee undeterred the huckabee campaign quickly showed up at mr norriss texas ranch where the two men met for the first time filmed an endorsement video that has racked up about million views on youtube in a week and then retreated to mr norriss gym for "some kicks and punches i needed a workout anyway " said mr norris mr huckabee warned viewers in the ad that "chuck norris doesnt endorse he tells america how its gonna be " mr norris played the straight man calling mr huckabee a "principled authentic conservative " he added it was his idea to end the ad with a close up of his fist and a screen reading "chuck norris approved " which he calls "part of my brand extension " political pros say that most celebrity endorsements are overrated still the buzz created when for example oprah winfrey announces she is endorsing barack obama can "give you control of the news cycle for a couple of days " says john geer a professor at vanderbilt university in tennessee an endorsement can help with some constituencies he adds in mr norriss case with young men who generally dont take part in the caucuses the huckabee campaign also could use mr norris to help toughen the image of mr huckabee who has drawn criticism from his republican opponents that he isnt tough enough "hes a man with a good heart but hes tough " said mr norris who shares mr huckabees conservative christian faith two decades ago mr norris says republican operative lee atwater approached him "when that wimp thing was going around " suggesting that george h w bush also wasnt tough enough to be president "next thing i know im on the campaign trail " he said the former president later helped mr norris get his karate program into some houston public schools mr norris added mr norriss celebrity at that time rested on his career as the star of a cops and karate television series "walker texas ranger " he largely abandoned films a few years ago to start a martial arts league and write books then the web site of pseudo facts with which he isnt affiliated gave him a huge new following among military personnel especially in iraq where he recently did a hand shaking tour and college students mr norris says he has dismissed suggestions from friends that he run for office himself "what if im campaigning and my opponent starts to attack my character and i leap over the desk and knock him unconscious "
