them correctly and with some regularity theyre not an antidote for lazy housekeeping since microbes die only when they come into direct contact with the steam chemicals ultraviolet light or metal ions other metals in addition to silver and zinc are being used to kill germs a practice that dates back thousands of years although some researchers question whether these metals can squelch heavy growths
