business insight a special report making the most of coos chief operating officers should have strong ties to the board but few do how can a company get the most out of its chief operating officer in many organizations the coo is the individual ultimately responsible for the execution of business strategy this makes the position a critical component of the top management team and one that should be of great interest to boards of directors our research however indicates that few companies have developed a strong working relationship between the coo and the board we believe this represents a tremendous missed opportunity for the coo the chief executive the board and the company itself first lets take a look at the benefits of such a relationship to each of the parties involved directors benefit in a number of ways to the extent the coo is involved and autonomous in board activities directors have access to a knowledgeable independent voice regarding the companys circumstances further with greater exposure to the coo directors come to understand something more about the strength of one of the key members of the management team and therefore about the companys prospects in addition board exposure during a coos tenure helps directors better evaluate the coos potential as heir to the ceo given the critical nature of ceo succession and the boards direct role in that process any opportunity for directors to gain a richer appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of a possible heir is not to be missed the ceo also reaps rewards from a strong coo board relationship first the ceo is credited with providing transparency that the ceo is comfortable allowing independent voices to reach the board suggests a confidence about the companys position and the ceos activities second the ceo benefits by demonstrating the ability to attract and develop talented executives to the extent the coo is an impressive knowledgeable and savvy executive the ceo benefits from the halo earned by the coo third whether or not the coo is currently considered the heir his or her untimely departure from the company could be a liability a healthy active coo board relationship can help a ceo retain a valued second in command who most likely is being courted by other companies finally when the coo has the ability to work independently and productively with the board the ceo has greater flexibility in structuring his or her own time with the board and otherwise though the colloquialism "many hands make light the work" is an oversimplification it is clear that having two knowledgeable voices at the board is likely to make each more effective for the coo there are also several benefits that an active board role will yield increased exposure not only will help expand the coos professional network but also will help build personal credibility in the eyes of board members coos are sometimes pigeonholed as being talented solely in execution and lacking the ability to think strategically a perception that can be deadly for a career such presumptions can be dispelled by providing the coo with opportunities to engage with directors more broadly direct access to board expertise allows directors to provide the coo with useful mentoring and performance feedback finally new ceos we talk with consistently stress the amount of time it takes to build productive relationships with board members in those cases where the coo is being groomed as heir board exposure allows relationship building to get a head start so how can a company reap all these benefits what is the model for a productive coo board relationship our research which brought us into contact with more than ceos and coos suggests three critical elements first the coo must have meaningful work to contribute to board activities meaningful work could be defined as coo led presentations to the board regarding company challenges and opportunities such as progress on the integration of an acquisition the development of an innovative product offering updates on the expansion of production capacity or the challenges associated with moving into new markets in other instances meaningful work could mean that the coo is an active participant in the work of various board committees maynard webb currently the ceo of liveops inc told us that while he was coo at ebay inc he worked closely with the compensation and governance committees and provided input for discussions about succession planning the second element underpinning a strong coo board relationship is that the coo must be seen as having an independent voice ultimately the ceo has to demonstrate that he or she trusts the coo to operate in his or her absence if it appears that the coo will merely parrot the party line directors will be quick to question the value of their interaction with the coo further directors will begin to question the ceos motive in engaging the coo with the board we spoke with a number of ceos who made a strong point of telling us that they intentionally left the room when their coo made presentations to the board they wanted to do all they could to demonstrate their unqualified trust in the coo and make certain their presence couldnt be construed as influencing the words chosen by the coo and though we advocate that ceos and coos should work tirelessly to present a united public front on business matters maintaining an independent voice means that each executive must be comfortable using time with the board as a forum for constructively working through complex business challenges where agreement is unlikely to emerge right away the third pillar of a strong coo board relationship is one on one relationships between the coo and board members if the only time the coo sees the board is at formal meetings the relationships will remain superficial making it more difficult for the coo and board members to benefit from one anothers insights as shantanu narayen president and ceo at adobe systems inc told us when he was the companys coo "as coo it is important that you build and nurture your relationships with individual board members doing so can help you better understand how to drive strategic priorities and potentially you have opportunities to establish a mentoring relationship with a key member or two " former quest diagnostics inc ceo ken freeman now a member at kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co told us that little things like having the coo sit next to different directors at each board meeting as well as bigger things such as arranging for the coo to meet regularly and privately with each director facilitate healthy relationships we have found that companies approach the relationship between the coo and the board in a variety of ways in some cases the board provides the impetus for a coo board relationship boards at companies like intel corp have been very deliberate in using the coo role to the fullest particularly with regard to succession planning for several generations intel has used the coo role to develop an internal successor in each case the executive who ascended to the position of ceo already was extremely well known to the board having been actively engaged with the directors while in the position of coo in fact the last two ceos were board members throughout their tenure as coo at many other companies the win win win scenario of a strong coo board relationship either hasnt been understood or its importance has been minimized in some of these companies there is simply no relationship the coo remains a relative stranger to the board and the board an unknown to the coo in others the coo board relationship is an emergent one the shape of which is impossible to predict not surprisingly when the precise form of the coo board relationship is left to happenstance the coo role is unlikely to create much value when the ceo and directors realize the relationship should be viewed as a strategic asset and that accordingly it should be managed deliberately and thoughtfully the better results are appreciated by the incumbent the ceo and the board dr bennett is the catherine w and edwin a wahlen professor
