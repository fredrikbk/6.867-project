business insight a special report raising your market iq too many companies gather intelligence on a narrow slice of consumers they need to think more broadly it sounds so obvious you have to know your market yet when it comes to actual market intelligence too many companies do it all wrong some miss the big picture by focusing on just a slice of their market or by limiting their studies to transactions and other customer data already in their possession others have the opposite problem they dont look at their customers closely enough causing them to miss opportunities right under their noses such efforts reveal little about new market opportunities and risk losing current customers to companies with better data by contrast obtaining a better understanding of a complete market and what drives customers purchasing decisions would help companies discover untapped or underserved customers how can companies get better information to make smarter decisions and increase their market share they need to raise their market iqs we believe the way to do that is by creating what we call a market panel a market panel is a sweeping detailed and continuing survey of a large carefully selected group of consumers who reflect a statistically reliable sample of a much larger market its a wide angle view of a markets total buying population made up of a series of individual portraits taken every six to months or so picture a comprehensive spreadsheet on which the rows represent thousands of individual consumers and the columns display specific information about them their demographic profile needs attitudes and behaviors their current spending and future purchase plans what competitors they patronize the factors that drive their product selections and satisfaction ratings their ratings of brands in short a market panel reveals how much and why consumers buy and from whom without such information a company can miss sizable and adjacent opportunities even while its own position is being eroded by focused competitors what separates a panel from most surveys is not only its sweeping view of the consumers who make up the market but the fact that it is repeated on a regular basis because the same group is surveyed at periodic intervals the panel reveals where market shifts are occurring where consumers are shopping more and less and how their total spending is changing so why arent more companies using market panels often its pressure to make decisions quickly which leads employees up down and across organizations to grasp for readily available data like transactions records which mainly tell you only whats been bought such data reveal very little about who the buyers are and nothing about what motivates them or how valuable they are accordingly many companies show the following signs of a low market iq signs of a low market iq a focus largely on current customers too many companies look primarily at internal data based on purchases such an approach blinds them to additional market opportunity data from a food and grocery panel we constructed last year showed that a customers typical weekly expenditure with a major grocer was on average only one third of the customers total weekly expenditure across all of the grocery stores at which he or she shopped as many as of all grocery shoppers in the market surveyed didnt shop at the major grocer making them lost customers or prospects for which the grocer had limited or no data a tendency to base proprietary strategies on what is publicly known concerns about re creating the wheel lead executives to resist developing their own thorough and independent view of a market they rely on publicly available reports for example from industry associations and analysts with investment firms reports not designed to give any one company an information advantage yet executives take the reports conclusions at face value often without knowing the applicability of the underlying data to their company and even cite them to substantiate proprietary plans a reliance on qualitative research most companies overuse qualitative research focus groups and interviews that instead of using hard data record and interpret consumer thoughts and reactions while qualitative research can be useful for exploring how and why consumers make purchase decisions indeed a market panel should examine such questions it is no substitute for such details as how much consumers spend on certain products who the consumers are and where they purchase a pattern of taking a piecemeal approach in the absence of a strong commitment by top executives to coordinated and detailed research different operations and divisions tend to undertake their own narrow one time studies separate studies are expensive difficult to integrate though much time and effort are spent trying and often use different assumptions and research methods without shared compelling market data decision making becomes a matter of internal politics departments battle one another and sometimes senior personnel try to prevail with outdated market views foundation for boosting iq we believe a full market panel can overcome many such problems landmark studies similar to market panels have been used for years in business and other fields the framingham heart study for example is a multidimensional survey that since has attempted to identify risk factors for heart disease in some residents of framingham mass a better known example is nielsen co s tracking of u s television viewing habits based on a detailed and continuing survey of thousands of households chosen to be representative of the overall u s tv audience the cost of creating a panel depends on the complexity of the market but can be similar to that of a one time survey at the high end both can cost from &# to &# million a panel because its repeated regularly will have additional costs though most occur in the beginning but the panel also will be of continuing value whereas the one time study becomes quickly dated it took our four person team three months to set up and begin deriving insights from a panel on the food and grocery retail sector a study commissioned by a client in the industry the client a big grocery chain saw designing a market panel based on its major urban markets as an opportunity to get all of its divisions on the same page with the help of a market research vendor we recruited participants for our survey sample online in general once a company knows the geographic boundaries for the market to be studied it can use data from the u s census bureau and its metropolitan statistical areas or msas to determine the groups composition the sample should reflect the demographic mix of the area based on such factors as income education and ethnicity participants also need incentives to stay motivated points redeemable for rewards or cash are options but rewards can be intangible too such as sharing findings with the respondents to make them feel involved broadly speaking then data should be collected every six to months and focus on the consumers commitment and spending the data should be managed from a single point by the office of the chief marketing officer for example but kept accessible throughout the organization companies can append selected internal data to the market panel when its relevant but the panel must not become a catch all for data using the panel once developed a market panel becomes a tool that can be used throughout the organization in a variety of ways experienced market strategists and operating personnel can recognize needs and identify the most valuable customers patterns of behavior and types of customers can indicate growth opportunities in our food and grocery panel for example one third of consumers said they were highly engaged in grocery shopping or considered it a "high priority " these customers tended to spend more and look for fresh and unique offerings rather than sales or promotions those who were most engaged and who according to our panel shopped regularly at trader joes and whole foods spent more on groceries per week than the least engaged such data sent a clear message to the sponsor of the panel get more of those highly engaged customers into your stores companies looking only at their own transactions would miss the full spectrum of consumers and be unable to calibrate their customer mix or identify which consumers to attract and why understand what drives consumer decisions in the grocery panel customers rated the stores where they primarily shopped as far more attractive than stores where they didnt still the data showed that the average shopper patronized stores regularly and shopped at six or more why because distinct stores fill distinct roles in a consumers shopping portfolio our data showed consumers shopped costco wholesale corp to make bulk purchases of food trader joes a unit of germanys aldi einkauf gmbh to find unique and interesting items wal mart stores inc to do one stop shopping for a broad variety of goods and traditional chains to replenish staples knowing why consumers behave as they do can tell you how to differentiate and where you can dominate the panel showed that our grocery chain client was attracting an above average share of consumers who considered themselves price sensitive and was losing more valuable consumers to niche competitors these more valuable consumers customers who spend more shopped its stores to buy low margin commodity items then they went elsewhere for high margin fresh items such as meat seafood and produce the revenue the grocer was losing to cross shopping at competitors by just one segment of its customers in one large area equaled the grocers total revenue in the same area panel data showed that this grocer could get business back from half of consumers with more variety for example in organic and international foods and signature products examine where you stand against competitors overall and in detail the grocery store company using our panel could see that of its customer base also shopped at costco whole foods market inc or trader joes also more specifically sources of growth and of erosion could be seen in high margin categories such as meat and produce pinpointing such information helps identify not only which competitors are making inroads into your business but in what categories their attacks are being most effective see where the market is headed market intelligence should not only assess but also predict where will the most growth be are spending habits changing which brands have momentum some traditional grocery chains are missing opportunities in convenience food for instance our panel data showed that more than a third of consumers would buy takeout from a grocery store companies looking only at existing grocery spending thus would miss out on of all food sales which is how much people spend on takeout track your performance precisely while a market panel creates a baseline for measuring growth the bigger benefits come over time seeing for instance whether your share of total spending grew in a certain consumer segment or whether opinions about your brand have changed in relation to opinions about a competitor with the market panel the grocer for the first time could directly compare its performance with those of its competitors across its portfolio of brands using a consistent methodology panel data also suggested that the grocer could increase its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization by if it improved its customer mix and increased its average customer spending just to the market average in a majority of its urban markets armed with better information and more choices than ever consumers are showing increasingly complex shopping behaviors and less loyalty to brands and stores in response companies are collecting more but not necessarily the right kind of data on their customers compared with the expense of one time studies or the cost of bad decisions the investment in a proprietary market panel is low its hard to see why any company wouldnt want to get
