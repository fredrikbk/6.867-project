weekend journal books a russian epic translated anew war and peace by leo tolstoy translated by richard pevear and larissa volokhonsky knopf pages &# count leo tolstoy belonged to one of the oldest families in russia a family that saw the czars as arrivistes in his prime he was tall handsome and rich it was also in his prime during the first years after his marriage in years that he would describe as the happiest in his life that tolstoy would write "war and peace " and the book perhaps the greatest novel ever written is full of such generosity understanding and joyful life that one can easily imagine the happiness tolstoy must have felt as he wrote it it is always a good time to read and reread "war and peace " but the current moment is an especially propitious one ecco press has recently published tolstoys first complete draft of the novel which had been published in stages during the late s a version described by a russian critic as "half as long and twice as good " only the first part of the claim is true and knopf has brought out a translation of the final draft the classic novel itself by richard pevear and larissa volokhonsky whose english language translations of the russian classics are now the gold standard "war and peace" is enormous more than pages in the pevear volokhonsky translation and one of its major plots is the story of two families as they marry into each other perhaps because this was such a traditional storyline in th century fiction the author was initially pigeonholed as a writer of potboilers tolstoys genius was however also recognized his ability to create characters as believable as any in shakespeare his understanding of how human relations work what was not recognized immediately was tolstoys artistry perhaps because "war and peace" appears so natural as if a story were simply occurring instead of being told reading the pevear volokhonsky translation though it is the artistry that leaps out even on the first page the book starts with passage of pure dialogue all voice and tone without even the conventions of "he said" and "she said " the daring of this is breathtaking dialogue is slow occurring in "real" time unlike physical description or authorial declaration it does not usually provide the propulsion needed to fling a reader into a novel by beginning in real time though "war and peace" sets the pace of the novel and prepares the reader for the rhythms of a long book here is the opening paragraph spoken at a party "well my prince genoa and lucca are now no more than possessions estates of the buonaparte family no i warn you if you do not tell me we are at war if you still allow yourself to palliate all the infamies all the atrocities of that antichrist upon my word i believe it i no longer know you you are no longer my faithful slave as you say well good evening good evening i see that i am frightening you sit down and tell me about it " we notice the comedy of manners implicit in the paragraph the excessive flattery "my faithful slave" and the ordeal of listening to someone who wont stop talking "i see that i am frightening you" but sober notes are being struck as well for "war and peace" is of course not only about marriages in an early th century social world but also about napoleons invasion of russia the first paragraph announces the novels second great storyline to capture the experience of the invasion another reason that the opening paragraph reveals tolstoys daring and artistry is that it is in french in fact there are conversations in french and german all through the novel to highlight another theme in russia there is an authentic russian culture and a grafted and inauthentic european one the war with napoleon was the beginning of pride and self confidence in the russianness of russia mr pevear and ms volokhonsky wisely leave tolstoys opening french in place unlike most other translations offering the english translation in a footnote they also keep throughout the novel the awkwardness of some of tolstoys deliberately awkward sentences these have the effect of making the reader feel that the novelist doesnt really care what the reader thinks and in turn may view his own characters coolly and shrewdly with detachment by contrast the original version of the novel now in english for the first time makes clear just how close "war and peace" came to being a sappy melodrama it features a happy ending major characters dont die they get married and live happily ever after the originals most striking aspect though is that it appears to be missing tolstoy one of the things that makes "war and peace " in its final form a strange book is that there are long sections where the omniscient narrator holds forth on bizarre topics whether women should wear makeup after they have had their first child for instance or famously what forces drive history forward the absence of this narration in the original suggests how necessary it is at times the narrators strange ideas make the strange ideas of the characters e g a characters belief that his own name is a code declaring him "killer of napoleon" appear more natural at other times and this is true for most of the book the reader is so caught up in the narrators thoughts that when his characters begin grappling with some of the same concerns the search for example for a truly unimpeachable moral character the expressed ideas feel organic not artificial or "intellectual " tolstoy once said that he did not want to tell stories but instead wanted to capture life reading these two versions of "war and peace " we can see how perhaps historys greatest novelist went about doing so mr sharma is the author of the novel "an obedient father "
