business insight a special report think strategically about technology licensing companies are discovering that internally produced technologies can yield huge profits when licensed to third parties what many of these companies still lack however is the ability to make licensing decisions an integral part of planning and strategy technology licensing often occurs almost as an afterthought when a company realizes that it wont benefit as much as it thought from one of its own inventions it then decides that the best use for the technology is in the hands of another company or even a different industry procter &amp gamble co for example uses only to of its patents in its own products international business machines corp and dow chemical co meanwhile each generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue from licensing technology to third parties texas instruments inc too makes licensing an integral part of its strategy in some years during the s licensing contributed about of the companys net income licensing offers other potential benefits as well it could be used for instance to establish industry standards enter new markets or gain access to other companies technology through collaborative projects but the risks are also great sharing competitive knowledge may serve to strengthen rivals for example all of which points to the need for integrated and strategic planning as part of technology development managers and executives must ask themselves does a technologys greatest potential lie in what it can contribute to the companys own productivity is it something every company in the industry might be interested in does it have applications in other markets and industries one way to begin answering such questions is to change the way one defines markets many companies segment markets by customers or by product characteristics but a technologys full potential may not be realized unless a market is defined instead as a "job" that consumers need to do for instance many people regard their cars primarily as mobile offices to date no company has designed a car optimized to do this mobile office job but products that specifically address this job can expand a firms business opportunities segmenting by job opens new markets to firms by identifying needs that their technologies can satisfy across product categories its a bigger challenge to identify how technologies can be applied in multiple fields including completely different industries some companies find it useful in such cases to take out a "road map " a diagram that lays out current structural relationships among technologies and applications and a consensus view of their future relationships as well we developed a road map for a business unit of a large machinery company with assistance from the firms technology and marketing experts the map visualizes links that exist among the companys technologies among its products and among potential licenses it also plots out links connecting the three levels following the links on the map the business unit saw that one of its technologies would be of great interest to the electronics industry and thanks to that lead the company now has a licensing agreement with an electronics company that leaves the machinery company with complete freedom in its own industry and with opportunities to license the same technology in additional industries meanwhile a strategic alliance with the electronics partner is a distinct possibility the road map is now a regular part of the business units strategic planning and has been used in other business units as well to decide for example whether to maintain or abandon patents on this basis the company has realized value from several internal technologies that formerly went unused while many companies have become aware of the relevance of technology licensing others have not yet recognized its importance and are in danger of missing major opportunities integrating technology planning into corporate strategy will increasingly be seen not merely as an option but as a necessity to keep up with competitors dr lichtenthaler and dr ernst are professors of technology and innovation management at whu otto beisheim school of management in vallendar germany they can be reached at reports wsj com
