the weekend interview with ang lee man without a country new york im like a proud son of china " taiwan born director ang lee says china certainly seems fond of mr lee his movies including "crouching tiger hidden dragon " "the ice storm" and "eat drink man woman " have earned him world wide applause and his films have won eight oscars mr lees latest film "lust caution " recently did a stint as no at the chinese box office when the director won an oscar for his gay cowboy epic "brokeback mountain " an official mainland newspaper pronounced him "the pride of the chinese people " chinese pride works in mysterious ways "brokeback mountain" was banned in mainland china and state media censored parts of mr lees award acceptance speech "theyre very proud of me winning the oscar theyre just not allowed to show it because of homosexuality " mr lee explains "life is full of contradictions and they live with that " he says "hardly anybody says that we are not proud of you because we cannot show your film or if were proud of you we have to overthrow everything that exists nobody thinks and acts like that they look at you and smile with goodwill " mr lee touches on a larger dilemma faced by foreign businesses struggling with mainland censorship google is one well known example is it better to stand on principle and push back against the communist government or do you play by beijings rules arguing that this approach will ultimately get more information into china "do i hold a grudge against them because they cannot show brokeback mountain publicly " mr lee asks with a hint of defiance "thats just " he laughs "thats life " he elaborates and in doing so weighs in on a much wider debate "im not going to not make a movie there because of that " i had met mr lee once before very briefly after a new york asia society screening of "lust caution " mr lee once described himself as shy and socially awkward and that night facing a crowd of people clamoring to talk to him the director did look a bit dazed by the spotlight one on one its a whole different story when we meet in a downtown manhattan office building the casually dressed mr lee greets me warmly plops himself down on a couch and proceeds to fire off bold opinions he laughs often and speaks in english with an occasional dash of mandarin mr lees attitude toward chinas ban of "brokeback mountain" may seem like nonchalance but perhaps the director was just biding his time one could argue that he took an even bigger risk by bringing his new film "lust caution " into china for starters the movie depicts a "disgraceful" slice of national history world war ii era occupation by the japanese and in particular the chinese who collaborated with them "the wang jingwei regime the collaborative government was never allowed to be filmed " mr lee explains mr lees vivid resurrection of this taboo period would be controversial on its own but the plot based on a story by zhang ailing might be even more daring the film mostly set in s japanese occupied shanghai is the tale of a patriotic chinese student who seduces a japanese collaborator the plan is to lure the traitor close and then have him killed but after a string of passionate encounters the film earned a nc rating in the u s but graphic sex scenes were cut from the mainland chinese version the young woman finds it tougher to carry out her mission "in lust caution i put female sexuality against patriotism " mr lee explains "thats very scary actually " chinese patriotism is not supposed to be negotiable "to us thats a black and white thing " mr lee says "you sacrifice yourself how can you let china down " chinas warm embrace of "lust caution" may reveal a growing acknowledgment that love of the motherland can be nuanced "now they can at least weigh humanity against some kind of big idea of patriotism " mr lee explains "im not saying patriotism is wrong " he says but "humans should go first " "lust caution" has already taken in over &# million in china it apparently did not strike the same chord in the u s where the film has received mixed reviews and made roughly &# million since its september release still the fact that the movie has been so well received in china or even that it is still playing is very encouraging says mr lee "it hasnt been taken down theres an outcry but its not big enough to take it down thats very positive to me " mr lee seems to feel that the success of such a controversial film in china could work as a catalyst for the government to loosen up the people to broaden their outlook and more filmmakers to strive for the truth mr lees broader goal is to project images of chinas past even some of the politically incorrect aspects onto the big screen "i try to revive what was and nobody can do it alone " he adds "if i dont do it now in five years its probably gone because the people who remember it will die " "i do believe that life is a continuous thing " mr lee says "you cant just chop off your history and start anew " chinas communists have certainly tried in particular during mao zedongs cultural revolution that began in which included the destruction of historical artifacts mr lee describes the cultural revolution "ive never seen a culture that hates itself so much " "you have to come from somewhere " he says "thats your culture your backbone who you are you cannot give that away whether its in the elite culture or pop culture you just need to come from somewhere and the best way to introduce this to young people is to make profitable films that relate to the past " one such film is the academy award winning "crouching tiger hidden dragon " an inventive martial arts adventure set in th century qing dynasty china the film didnt make much of a splash on the mainland but in the u s at least it was a soaring success perhaps western audiences are just more easily lifted out of their seats by deftly choreographed sword fighting flying warriors and elegant bamboo forests with "crouching tiger hidden dragon " mr lee did more than bring traditional images to the worlds screens with streamlined special effects he made old fashioned china look incredibly cool mr lees emphasis on the old china goes back to his upbringing his parents were from the mainland but the communist victory in the chinese civil war led them to flee to taiwan where mr lee was born in taiwan did not suffer from the same attempts to demolish chinese history "in taiwan we carry the torch of the classic chinese culture of feudal society so to speak we didnt go through cultural revolution and communism " mr lee says "in hong kong and taiwan were brought up in the old fashioned way and china has changed drastically i still grew up relatively similar to how my father was brought up " mr lee tells me that growing up in taiwan influenced his career in other ways as well he says that in his films he always takes "the losing side " "somebody dies somebody loses well gay cowboys theyre not going to win " he explains you might be wondering what all this has to do with taiwan "i grew up in taiwan we always lose " mr lee says he laughs good naturedly "nobody wins anything thats just how i grew up were always on the losing side my parents get beat by the communists they escape to taiwan taiwans a small island hardly anybody pays attention up until the late s i still get this i come here where are you from i say taiwan people say oh i love thai food " taiwan of course also has more serious dilemmas "you live in fear that communists will take over chinas so big and taiwan is a small island we look at america as the big brother the protector the good guys so after the vietnam war its very frightening americas in trouble and you feel very insecure so i think taiwan needs americans to be the good guys " mr lee describes the current mood in taiwan as "quite depressing " its "splitting " he says between more independence minded people and those who "have a hard time to believe were not chinese " where does mr lee fit in "at heart im still chinese thats how i was brought up my parents came from china were the outsiders " yet in china he says "i think im somewhat of a native and a guest at the same time " mr lees work is not immune from taiwan mainland politics such was the case with the venice international film festival a few months back taiwan criticized the festival for listing "lust caution" as originating in "taiwan china " as opposed to simply "taiwan " "i wish the world was like the john lennon song goes imagine theres no country " mr lee says laughing "i like to be in that gray zone area where people see me as all of the above " mr lees aversion to being categorized helps explain why after making a series of successful chinese language films such as "pushing hands " "the wedding banquet" and "eat drink man woman " he plunged into american film with "sense and sensibility" in and two years later with the chilling suburban drama "the ice storm " later came the american civil war story "ride with the devil " followed by a foray into the comic book genre with "hulk" in "i think all my career im jumping around " he says "i like to live in a limbo a gray area i think thats life " mr lee may not want to be seen as a spokesman or his films as "representative" of a certain culture but this seems difficult to avoid he mentions "eat drink man woman " which gives ample camera time to a familys sumptuous sunday feasts "probably a big part of the world their only impression about taiwan is that movie they ask me do you eat like that every sunday its like can i use a metaphor " "i took on challenge after challenge because i insist on living in a gray area " says mr lee "and be truthful to life " he pauses then adds with a soft laugh "maybe " mr lees embrace of the "gray" is what makes his films so powerful in theaters east and west his work tests societys black and white images of a cowboy a patriot or even a martial arts film "as an artist i think its important to be brave to be truthful " he says and why is it braver to be in a gray area "because you challenge the existing the established " he responds "any establishment is convenient for a while then when its so established it becomes stiff and as a rule of life when something gets stiff it dies " ms parker is an assistant
