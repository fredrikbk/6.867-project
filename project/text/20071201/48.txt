mid cap funds enjoy quiet runup lost among all the stock market tumult mutual funds focusing on fast growing midsize companies are having a blockbuster year these mid cap growth funds have been feasting on stocks posting double digit returns in some cases triple digits and while many investors think of growth stock funds as tech heavy this years gains are coming from a wide range industries such as agriculture engineering aerospace and asset management many of these industries are usually considered "cyclical " meaning their earnings ebb and flow in sync with the economy thats still the case but this time the potential for a weakening of the u s economy is being offset by expectations for strength outside u s borders "growth has popped up in some unexpected places " says american century portfolio manager glenn fogle the result is the average midcap growth fund is up this year through thursday according to morningstar inc while the standard &amp poors stock index comprised of the markets biggest companies is up among the best performers are several funds from american century such as its vista portfolio which is up the transamerica premier growth opportunities fund is up and the j p morgan growth advantage fund has gained amid turmoil in the markets is turning out to be the year where a long awaited revival in the fortunes of growth stocks is finally panning out thats especially been true during the second part of the year when against the backdrop of concerns about the strength of the u s economy investors have been willing to bid up prices on companies posting solid earnings gains "the credit crunch has made it much more difficult for companies that didnt generate their own cash to generate growth and gave a boost to companies that do " says john huber a co manager on the transamerica growth opportunities portfolio despite forecasts that large cap growth stocks would be the main beneficiary the sweet spot has been midcap stocks which morningstar defines as having a stock market value of &# billion to &# billion in a troubled economic environment "midcaps are generally more stable in terms of having diversified revenue streams than small companies and faster growth rates than large caps " says mr huber that isnt to say these stocks dont have their risks particularly if the u s economy tilts into a real recession rather than experiencing the moderate slowdown that most of wall street expects some of these stocks are now posting higher valuations that could leave them at risk of swift declines though overall mid caps arent that expensive in fact the price to earnings ratio on the standard &amp poors mid cap index for earnings is at its lowest level in years and if the weakness in the u s spread to overseas economy companies that have been propped up by growth outside the u s could be especially vulnerable for now among the biggest beneficiaries have been aerospace companies where demand from the middle east and china have been fueling aircraft orders a winner for several midcap stock funds has been precision castparts corp up this year it manufactures metal components for companies such as boeing co precision has been winning more business from boeing and "its a stock that has a great long term track record " says christopher jones a portfolio manager on the j p morgan growth advantage fund also benefiting from global growth are agriculture companies a number of the winners for midcap funds are now large cap companies such as mosiac co a fertilizer company that is up more than triple this year "as standards of living rise theres more demand for corn and wheat " says american centurys mr fogle "these companies are beneficiaries of globalization " indeed surging demand for grain and especially corn for ethanol has driven growth for companies all along the food chain ranging from seeds from monsanto co to tractors from deere &amp co another source of big returns has been engineering companies particularly those that have some focus in the energy industry the blackrock u s opportunities portfolio is up so far in with help from such companies including jacobs engineering group inc which has doubled this year and layne christensen co up "within construction and engineering companies that have good mining and energy exposure are where we see the strength " says jean rosenbaum a portfolio manager on the blackrock fund several funds also have had good luck in a completely different corner of the economy with gamestop corp a retailer that specializes in video games it is up more than in as a result of the credit crunch and the damage inflicted in banks and big wall street firms just about anything in the financial services realm has been a loser except money management firms most publicly traded money management firms for instance mutual fund companies have side stepped trouble and with a business model based on collecting flat fees have been an oasis of earnings stability t rowe price group inc for example is up so far in enough of a gain to take it from a mid cap stock into large cap territory t rowe has benefited from a strong overseas presence and a booming k business that is likely to only strengthen after last years revisions to the rules that govern how corporate retirement plans work says transamericas mr huber "its firing on all cylinders "
