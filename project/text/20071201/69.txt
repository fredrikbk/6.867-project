administration floridas state board imposed the freeze on withdrawals from its local government investment pool thursday after the funds investors nervous local governments and school districts yanked &# billion out over two weeks on concerns that money was invested in risky mortgage related securities "we knew there was trouble " said sharon bock clerk and comptroller for palm beach county who had &# million in the investment pool in september but withdrew the last of it wednesday "we saw that several investments were backed by mortgage backed securities " florida isnt the only fund to be hit standard &amp poors in october put a fund in king county wash on watch for downgrade because of the &# billion county funds investments in three so called structured investment vehicles or sivs these are commonly bank affiliates that raise money by selling short term debt and using it to buy higher yielding long term securities in montana the board of investments has been hit with &# million in withdrawals this week from a &# billion fund called the short term investment pool following reports about floridas problems the spread of subprimes influence into the state run world shows the mortgage crisis is hitting investors once thought to be removed from the damage while these funds arent believed to have bought any of the riskiest paper scooped up by hedge funds and banks they have nonetheless suffered collateral damage as even the highest rated mortgage backed securities have become illiquid putting short term funds in a bind they never saw coming "people believed they were doing things prudently but some tried to get a little more yield and thought why not " richard larkin a municipal bond expert at jb hanauer &amp co said "everyone believed a rated commercial paper was safe theyre realizing that isnt enough " the florida investment pool one of around or so nationwide is like a money market fund that was supposed to provide a safe liquid vehicle for investors to park cash used temporarily the money in the funds is generally used for payroll and other government regular operations moodys investors service has begun surveying all state investment pools to see whether they have exposure to these instruments and if there have been any withdrawals similar to florida according to bob kurtter managing director in public finance at the rating agency "the financial markets are complex and rapidly developing " he said "sometimes new instruments are developed that fall within the bounds of existing investment guidelines but may pose risks that werent anticipated at the time " moodys knows of problems in florida and similar but smaller issues in montana the rating agency has also been talking with a county on the east coast that recently took a loss from an investment its cash pool made in a siv mr kurtter said the information is confidential he added "we have been reassured that problem is under control and manageable " he said "they are seeking some recourse against whoever sold it to them as word spread of floridas mass withdrawals and then the suspension other investment pools around the country took steps to reassure their investors "the purpose of this letter is to assure you that georgia fund is not invested in nor has ever been invested in the types of subprime backed investments that are generating such losses " w daniel ebersole director of georgias office of treasury and fiscal services wrote to investors on wednesday mr ebersole said he drafted the letter after a "couple of enquiries" from georgia investors who had been spooked after hearing about the florida news floridas predicament is the latest example of investors stretching in search of higher yields without realizing the full risks they were taking on public finance experts said one high profile example of this was orange county calif in which like florida ran a short term investment pool for local governments and school boards in the area after orange county went bankrupt many states and counties tightened guidelines to ensure investments were short term and had top ratings from a leading agency mr larkin said but investment vehicles like sivs were then developed that had top ratings but had riskier underlying assets that allowed state and county investment pools to stay within their stricter guidelines but invest in higher yielding assets mr larkin and others say "theres a pattern here " he added "this seems to happen every five to ten years "
