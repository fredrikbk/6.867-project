politics &amp economics new fuel standards are poised to advance after several days of sometimes tense negotiations the centerpiece of the energy bill that will be moved through the house during the week is taking shape a proposal to sharply boost vehicle fuel economy standards top house lawmakers are working toward a plan that would raise fuel economy standards to miles per gallon by the level the senate initially approved by last summer congressional aides stressed that no final deal has been reached but after discussions friday between house energy and commerce chairman john dingell d mich and speaker nancy pelosi d calif the major components are beginning to fall into place the changes if adopted would mark the first time in more than two decades that fuel economy standards for passenger cars have been increased regulators have incrementally increased standards on light trucks but car standards havent been raised from mpg since the emerging deal will ensure auto makers have some added flexibility to meet the higher target and will specifically provide for separate treatment for cars and light trucks so long as the overall fleet average reaches mpg the lawmakers are moving toward a plan to extend the so called flex fuel credit which encourages companies to make cars that burn ethanol and other cleaner burning biofuels the credit ensures that autos capable of burning a high amount of ethanol count slightly more than regular vehicles when auto makers calculate compliance with the corporate average fuel economy standards or cafe the credit is popular with auto makers because it requires a relatively inexpensive change in equipment but environmental groups complain that most flexible fuel vehicles dont use fuels with higher ethanol content because they are only available in some parts of the midwest under the emerging legislation the credit would be made somewhat more generous than it currently is and would be extended through the credit is currently set to expire at the end of after the credit would begin to phase out and would be eliminated entirely by the final wrangling is over what role the environmental protection agency and the department of transportation will have in regulating the new fuel economy standards congressional aides said mr dingell was pushing for language that would prevent epa from regulating tailpipe emissions in a way that could in effect regulate fuel economy a power that rests with the transportation department people familiar with the negotiations said the epa is devising rules to regulate tailpipe emissions following a supreme court ruling earlier this year that the agency could regulate carbon dioxide under the federal clean air act the proposed increase in fuel economy standards would be about higher than current levels according to the department of energy which has run computer models of a similar increase it would have both costs and benefits for consumers the price of the average new car would rise by about &# in years but because of declining demand for fuel the annual expense of gasoline should drop by about &# or more a year higher automobile prices would mean fewer autos sold and as a result less fuel efficient older cars would be driven longer slowing the rate of turnover in the nations auto fleet the use of less gasoline would mean the nation would also become slightly less dependent on imported oil what is unclear is how much more auto makers would have spent to remain competitive without a prod from congress because higher gasoline prices have already begun to shift consumer buying patterns toward more efficient cars
