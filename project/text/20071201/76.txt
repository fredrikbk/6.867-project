weekend journal books a baltimore walkabout charm city by madison smartt bell crown pages &# along the waterfront of an east baltimore neighborhood called fells point is a locally renowned pub called the cats eye a couple of hundred years ago fells point was the home of a thriving shipyard but over time the area followed the familiar urban pattern of long dereliction bohemian homesteading and then upscale gentrification novelist madison smartt bell a cats eye habitue and baltimore resident for more than two decades has seen the fells point transition from artsy hangout to real estate investment haven a development that he doesnt seem to approve of but he retains his affection for the pub especially its live music and so it was a natural stop for him in "charm city a walk through baltimore " the book was commissioned as part of the crown journeys series of titles devoted to walking tours of disparate locales most of them in the u s a plum sort of writerly assignment mr bells good fortune continues on wednesday he landed a &# strauss living award given every five years by the american academy of arts and letters when he walks along to the cats eye in the fells point chapter it is a wintry sunday afternoon mr bell an amateur guitarist wants to have a pint of beer and watch his friend steve kraemer a pianist who plays with a group called the bluesicians "rest assured you wont hear any of that same old blues crap here " mr bell writes "kraemers somewhat obsessive intelligence is always on the prowl for unusual material and interesting ways to play it " mr bell a middle aged boomer is to his dismay joined at the bar by a young man zonked on this or that drink or drug whos wearing "an oversized ultra ugly heavy metal t shirt with heads of rotting corpses screened in orange over black " the kid forces the writer to endure a tale of woe he lost his girlfriends car which he left unlocked as he becomes more incoherent and distraught and remains oblivious to the music which of course offers just the sort of tonic a sad soul needs mr bells annoyance grows but he finally hands over five dollars and watches the guy disappear into the evening and cobblestone streets of fells point the anecdote has a nice rambling quality that is entirely in keeping with this largely delightful and informative book in the fells point chapter we get the cats eye experience but also a potted history of this section of baltimore starting from the time the "swampy promontory" was purchased by "a quaker ships carpenter named william fell" in mr bell who teaches creative writing at goucher college in the baltimore suburb of towson md and has published a bevy of novels since his debut "washington square ensemble " is an able storyteller we gladly tag along with him and various friends of his as they explore this grand old citys neighborhoods obscure restaurants and architectural curiosities he provides plenty of background about baltimore as a onetime bustling hub of shipping and manufacturing but mr bell is most interesting when he explains in entertaining and roundabout ways his affection for a quirky town that over the years has had many nicknames "monumental city " "mobtown " "crabtown" with "charm city" among the more recent "some people assume and believe that baltimore was already called charm city back in the days when h l mencken and edgar allan poe walked this patch of earth not so " mr bell writes going on to explain that the term was a hapless attempt to attract tourists to baltimore in the s a time when the city was not looking its best "the charm offensive opened in july ten days into a garbage collection strike that left mounds of stinking rubbish all over the streets " the strike soon spread to many municipal workers including zookeepers and "a sizable chunk of the baltimore police force " mr bell says a spasm of looting and arson broke out leading to oft repeated tales of how larger carnivores at the zoo began eating smaller animals "but wait this episode with all its grotesque irony alongside the outcome that the zoo animals didnt really eat each other and not too many people really got hurt turns into a classic baltimore thing weird sometimes disturbingly so but once you had come out safe on the far side of it maybe kinda wonderful too " in mr bells review of baltimores many nicknames he mentions one "tinytown " that he accurately credits to city paper the alternative weekly i co founded in baltimore in i had come to the city in to attend johns hopkins university and stayed years after selling the paper i moved away but returned in with my wife and two sons so the years ive lived in the city roughly overlap with much of the time mr bell has been there and i naturally have a few quibbles with some of his assessments of the place weve both gladly adopted as home for instance he mentions many times how expensive housing and private schools in baltimore have become in the past decade a view certainly not shared by anyone who lives in nearby washington where the prices are stratospheric yet mr bells griping is actually an encouraging sign his reverse there goes the neighborhood complaints about an influx of new money is testimony to the fact that baltimore may finally be experiencing a sustained revival now that would be charming mr smith writes weekly columns for new york press and baltimores city paper
