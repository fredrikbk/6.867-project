weekend journal recreation gearing up running with the satellites gps tells runners a lot possibly too much digital dumps in kenya eldoret kenya in this cradle of world beating marathon runners i set out for a run hooked up to a couple of global positioning system devices that record distance speed and time one of them with ipod style earphones even tells me my pace every quarter mile i started as my gadgets informed me at a m and in half a mile i had left the pavement and settled onto dirt roads african red and glistening from equatorial rains i decided to run miles and shoot for a minute mile pace i was never into exercise gadgets i didnt even run with an ipod because i love the sound of birds the wind and my own breathing and i love the elation which every runner knows when ones muscles have warmed up and strength and speed become their own joy an exuberant physicality at one with the whole natural world for ryan hall the year old who just won the u s olympic marathon trials training is "a way of worshipping i feel really close to him when i run " mr hall says "i cant sing very well but i can run " a couple of years ago i began to consider another reason for running competition if not against others then against myself i began to ask how far am i running and how fast i wonder sometimes if that question wasnt a whisper from the serpent and the answer a bite from the apple one warm humid night in ulundi the zulu nations historical capital in what is now south africa i marked my starting point then ran up a long incline past countless round mud and wattle homes with thatched roofs and marked the point i reached at minutes the next day i drove my car along the route and discovered it was four miles that meant eight miles an hour for a pace of minute miles that i decided was my pace about eight months later in eldoret even though the elevation is feet even though i was battling sleep deprivation and was coming off a sprained ankle that had kept me from running for three months i decided to shoot for "my pace" of minute miles as i ran the thin air crisp as champagne and just as heady i realized i was listening to the voice in the headphones intoning my pace not to my body the elation never quite came i was pushing too hard robbing my body of its sense of power just so i could match "my pace " i was times slave over the past few months my reporter job has taken me to three continents where ive tested two gps devices the one with the earphones the adeo is made by a small company motionlingo and sold online for as little as &# it hooks onto ones shorts with a belt clip connected to an ipod its computerized female voice occasionally interrupts to say soothingly but implacably how im doing the other device the forerunner from gps giant garmin retails for &# but can be found online for as little as &# its a large wristwatch it doesnt talk but a glance at the face tells me my pace and distance run a heart monitor straps around your chest but ive never tried it too much gadgetry after the run you can plug either device via usb cable into a computer to tabulate your workout stats calories burned elevation gained highest speed reached most alluringly the devices also map your run on web sites such as garmins motionbased com trainingpeaks com or motionlingo com which can require subscriptions you can map your routes on google maps and google earth and e mail them to friends i gravitated to the garmin and not just because one of my two adeos malfunctioned the garmin locks onto the satellites faster which is nice because before a run one must stand stock still as the gadget homes in on the satellites but mainly the garmin seems simpler adeos belt clip wasnt always secure and the device occasionally bounced out and fell with the garmin i can see my pace whenever i want not only when the preprogrammed voice decides to chime in and im free from the earphone wire at age i run for joy why do i need a digital taskmaster for one reason hills dont get any easier my regular run at home in los angeles through griffith park home of the hollywood sign starts at an elevation just below feet and goes up to about feet my lungs burn and my steps slow at the same steep inclines if i knew my pace i would know if i were getting stronger and faster and i would know when i was slacking off to put it plainly at least some of my exuberance was based in ignorance i felt good because um i wasnt going that fast i want to feel strong at but i also want to be strong after all how much more time do i have left to run semi seriously can i keep going into my s running farther and faster though as futile as any other ploy is my attempt to outpace the indignities that time perpetrates on the body mr hall whose olympic trial pace was less than five minutes a mile says he uses a garmin gps device when he travels because he doesnt know the lay of the land and wants to know how far and fast hes running "but i dont use it on a daily basis at all " he says "you can get all discouraged " he explains "a lot of runners get into how fast they run on their easy days no one just wants to plod along but you get into this always need to push mentality but especially on marathon training you need to let your body absorb the training " he concludes "if your body needs to recover with miles thats what it needs to do my big thing is moderation " well moderation for an olympian my goal is mr halls example of an ultraslow recovery pace i never held during my time in kenya but i wasnt far off usually running around then when i returned to the steep hills of l a my pace fell to nine and even minute miles for weeks i felt other sensations every runner knows legs like wet wood lungs like thick lava spirits like dirty snow the gps made it worse sure i ran miles but so slowly mr halls warning rang in my mind "you can get all discouraged " then work sent me to spain and i had a breakthrough a five mile run in madrids retiro park where i held a pace and the next day a mile run in madrids casa de campo park where i held i wasnt minding my gps i was just listening to my body running what felt comfortable as mr hall says "when youre feeling really good you know it " back home i just ran a miler through the angeles national forest for much of it i felt ragged and spent my pace a droopy but my spain breakthrough has infused me with a new zen a string of slow runs doesnt mean faster runs will never come again so the gps didnt discourage me yeah i ran slow but i ran miles indeed the numbers bestow a satisfying sense of accomplishment which is why i plan to keep using the device maybe on a future run ill shave a few seconds off my pace and maybe all my running will defer by a few weeks or months the inevitable disintegration of my body maybe but ive learned i run mainly for moments apart from the ordinary ticking of minutes and seconds dates and deadlines in the angeles forest i crest a hill my legs burning with achievement and relief when a deep canyon sweeps into view and a large antlered buck bounds along the trail and into that field of experience where everything is miraculous and vivid
