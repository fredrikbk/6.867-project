the buzz marketwatch weekend investor dividend darling american capital changes formula but keeps bravado when i think of the companies that have made me look the silliest american capital strategies ltd is high on the list the maryland based business development company invests in and lends to mostly small and midsize private companies that need cash or a partner in a buyout it likes to compare itself with a growth and income mutual fund in when it first hit my radar its dividend yield exceeding looked too good to be true higher rewards after all are supposed to equal higher risks as many investors in the high yielding subprime mortgage space recently learned the hard way the bearish argument which i tended to favor at the time claimed that american capital didnt really earn its dividend it further suggested that once wall street figured this out it would stop refilling the companys cash tank by readily buying its frequent secondary offerings american capital said its critics were wrong and started spotlighting its history of rising dividends with the slogan "you cant restate a dividend " investors agreed flocking to american capitals regular offerings as its shares outstanding more than quadrupled on a stock price that since late has more than doubled its dividends have jumped in the same time in other words i got it wrong why worry now this time it isnt about whether the company earns its dividend which still yields more than but possible viability and volatility of that dividend and while not highlighting this as a possible problem not that any company would american capital unintentionally was first to draw attention to it with an announcement several weeks ago of a changed "dividend policy " a yellow flag pops up anytime a company makes any kind of change in something it has always done the color turns red if the company is viewed largely as a dividend play and then changes the way the dividend is derived to understand the significance you first need some background much like a real estate investment trust business development companies like american capital are required to pay out of their taxable income in the form of a dividend the income comes from a variety of sources including interest and dividends from portfolio companies as well as the management fees they charge those companies american capital traditionally has paid dividends exclusively from income which in recent years has exceeded the amount of the payout in the past when it sold a company at a gain american capital booked a profit but didnt use the proceeds to pay the dividend that makes sense because capital gains are unpredictable and dividends need to be paid out every quarter now the company is adding these profits to the pool of money it uses to pay the dividend any excess is banked almost as a cookie jar in case of a dividend related shortfall in the future more than the policy change itself "its the timing of the switch" that concerns analyst scott valentin of friedman billings ramsey one of a number of former american capital fans who have grown increasingly cautious according to mr valentin who has a history of not pulling punches the change "reflects mounting pressure to maintain dividend growth" in the face of possibly slowing net operating income growth wachovia analyst jim shanahan goes so far as to say he is "skeptical as to the sustainability of the dividend policy " especially if the company is expecting to count more on capital gains when the market for selling companies mightnt be as great as it had been but according to chief executive malon wilkus his companys critics simply dont get it he felt the same way when i first talked to him several years ago except now he is far more emphatic not only does he believe the companys dividend is safe but he says it will be far easier for american capital to increase dividends especially with the company able to charge more for loans in the credit crunchs wake he adds that critics "are completely wasting their time" on business development companies "because by definition they are some of the strongest publicly traded financials because by law they are limited to a debt to equity ratio of to " american capitals he points out is even lower than that "we have one of the strongest balance sheets anywhere in the world of finance as long as the balance sheet isnt levered " mr wilkus says "it isnt hard to pay the dividend " i cant stress how confident he is about how right he is critics say he is overconfident this is for sure both cant be right herb greenberg marketwatch senior columnist doesnt own stocks except his employers nor sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of wall street journal publisher dow jones email hgreenberg marketwatch com
