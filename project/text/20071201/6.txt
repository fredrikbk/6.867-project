business insight a special report how to get ahead by going backward lessons from those who took career risks and succeeded when it comes to advancing a career sometimes the best way to take a step forward is to take a step back for most people a promotion is the cure for a stagnating career theyve accomplished and learned all they can at one job so they aim for the next one up the ladder hoping it will bring them bigger personal and financial rewards but a few pursue a much riskier strategy instead of trying to move up they take a lower level job that gives them valuable new skills and experience theyre prepared to accept a short term loss of income and prestige betting that the knowledge they gain will lead to a better job down the road to figure out the best way to move ahead by moving backward we interviewed successful executives who have made contrarian career moves a few common themes emerged in their stories for one the executives said they knew exactly what they were getting into when they took backward steps they knew what skills they were seeking in the new job and since they had a broader career plan in mind they were prepared to accept lower pay or a diminished profile to achieve it moreover they were pursuing a goal they felt passionate about they werent running away from problems or dissatisfaction at a current job their backtracks were also grounded in success in one venture which provided confidence and often a financial cushion to pursue an interest elsewhere finally with a secure cushion they were confident enough to take a backward step at any stage of their career even on the cusp of retirement of course this strategy is not for everyone nor does it automatically lead to the proverbial greener grass but for people willing to plan their career several steps ahead and take some risks to achieve a goal it can be a rewarding strategy heres a closer look at the lessons we gleaned understand what skill gap you are trying to fill successful career transitions are grounded in the desire to gain a new skill or experience in a different part of a company for instance moving from finance to operations or in a different industry those who navigated the change successfully knew exactly what they were looking to acquire by making the move alan j lacy who among other things is a senior adviser to a private equity firm recalls a strategic career move he made in the late s mr lacy made a "development move" from the treasurers job at dart &amp kraft now kraft foods inc to a divisional finance job after being a corporate officer for three years he realized that the treasurer position tended to be a lifelong job the person he succeeded had held the title for more than years still in his s mr lacy wasnt ready to commit to the job for the rest of his career so he decided to get some hands on experience in operational finance as well as international exposure at krafts overseas arm his goal to become the chief financial officer of a public company "one of the things ive counseled people on over the years is when you make a couple of lateral moves and take jobs that might even be perceived as a demotion in the early part of your career you are building breadth " mr lacy says "you have to have depth whether in marketing finance or operations but you should also try to build as much breadth as you can " the move paid off mr lacy became cfo of a public company at age and became cfo of sears roebuck &amp co at age he later made a similar decision he decided he didnt want to be a cfo for the rest of his career so he left the job to run searss credit business in once again the development move paid off in he was named chief executive of sears run toward something positive rather than away from something negative a backward career move is not an escape plan to pursue fantasies quitting the to job for a cabin in the woods to write poetry or trading in ones wingtips for hiking boots nor does it involve running away from responsibilities personal problems and unfinished business moves that are steeped in failure and destine an individual to encounter the same challenges again just in a different environment instead the shift should be rooted in a strong desire to take on the job in question such as rediscovering a passion or building professional breadth in order to achieve a dearly held goal for thomas ryder the passion came from a sense of obligation to help his company and his peers the retired chairman and chief executive officer of readers digest association inc mr ryder was a member of the senior management committee at american express co until about managing noncore businesses "the joke was that i was in charge of other as in other businesses " he recalls "then one day a new boss came in who told us we were going back to our core business and core competency when he gave that speech it occurred to me that other was out of business and it was indeed " mr ryder could have jumped to another company or marketed himself aggressively to the companys core businesses instead he decided to take on the challenge of selling the noncore businesses even though it meant leaving the executive committee and taking a psychological demotion in spite of an uncertain outcome he did not run away not from the difficult tasks ahead nor from the responsibilities he faced his sense of responsibility to his subordinates and superiors as well as the opportunity to gain valuable experience in the tougher side of operations liquidating businesses was a backward step that paid off in the short and long term "in the process of what i did i earned an extra measure of respect from my new bosses " mr ryder says "it wasnt too long before they invited me back to take on a much bigger job one of the biggest and most important jobs at the company at that time " the new assignment president of establishment services worldwide the division that dealt with all the merchants who accepted the american express card embrace the intrinsic rewards executives who made abrupt departures from their career paths were willing to accept pay cuts and less prestige they recognized that the temporary losses were less important than the intrinsic rewards of the new challenge such as learning skills or fulfilling a long held dream its crucial to bear those intrinsic rewards in mind in the face of incredulity from peers consider mr lacy when he took his strategic step fellow executives "were shaking their heads " he says "they didnt understand why i would do that " although he didnt suffer a loss of salary "from a status standpoint it was a huge shift " he says "i had been a corporate officer going to board meetings and being in charge of the finance committee treasury departments also have relationships with people outside the company including partners at investment banking firms then i went into this very internal job where the only external relationships would probably be with the auditor " the thing to remember is that "a backward step is in the eye of the beholder " says jon fieldman chief operating officer and general counsel of crestview capital partners a hedge fund mr fieldman has made several career transitions seeking out jobs that could help him develop skills such as teamwork and transforming organizations along the way for instance he left a large and prestigious chicago law firm and eventually became chief information officer of a xerox subsidiary his goal in making the moves he says was "to grow and stretch as a leader so that i develop my gifts improve upon my weaknesses and contribute to the world as best as i can " have a safety net success begets success having achieved goals found recognition and enjoyed the rewards of their successes in one area executives were able to handle the psychological challenge of backward moves indeed many of the executives interviewed made more than one backward move in their careers the success of previous tactical shifts gave them confidence and experience for future moves building on previous successes may also provide another type of safety net at least temporarily a financial cushion to make up for the loss of salary or bonus dont move for emotional reasons counterdirectional moves may carry emotional rewards but they shouldnt be emotionally driven sudden radical changes that are driven by anger at a boss a company the loss of a promotion because of a merger and so forth or other negative catalysts rarely result in well founded successful change usually people making a successful decisive move have put a lot of time into evaluating their next career steps which allows them to capitalize on opportunities its never too late to transition most of the executives spoke of having made one or two backward moves early or mid career from the late s through early s it may be easier and more acceptable to switch career gears and make contrarian moves but transitions can be made at virtually any career phase as long as one has sufficient psychological and financial cushions after a lifetime in publishing larry kirshbaum wanted to make a move before he retired as ceo of warner books in at age after enjoying a record year for his division he left to become a literary agent pursuing his lifelong love of books and working with authors this premeditated backward move brought a dramatic step down in salary for a former corporate officer and head of a business that last year was acquired for more than &# million as well as a decline in prestige mr kirshbaum believes such moves are better made sooner rather than later but the timing doesnt matter as much as your attitude "if you have a strong predilection for entrepreneurship exercise it as early as you can " he says "build something up with more time you wont be taking as much of a financial jolt as i have but it seems to me that if anyone today feels the way i do at the age of which is as if i were then the timing doesnt matter its a state of mind " part of the state of mind is what mr kirshbaum describes as the "fertile void " literally a space of time and attention that is purposefully left vacant rather than being crammed full of obligations and responsibilities "if you dont fill up all the time and space around you and you leave some open time the void will be filled with very interesting things you havent anticipated " he says "out of the blue have come some wonderful opportunities that would never have occurred to me if i had not gone out on my own and opened myself to a more freewheeling situation " those new opportunities include moving into private equity as a board member of a wholesale book distributor expanding his charitable activities and representing a range of interesting and successful books moreover after representing a cardiologists diet book mr kirshbaum says he has "stopped eating junk food lost pounds and started working with a personal trainer three days a week i feel better and i look healthier " in conclusion a caveat the element of risk and the possibility of failure in this strategy cant be understated there is no guarantee that if you make a backward move you will automatically propel yourself forward on a different track ultimately only you can judge your ability to handle the emotional upheaval and the risks involved in making a bold step off the career path the stories from these executives are peppered with the phrases i wondered i had a feeling i thought they were really comfortable with their own psyches because they knew what worked for them with that knowledge they boldly but strategically stepped off the career path laid out for them and blazed their own trails mr white retired chairman and chief executive of bell &amp howell co is professor of industrial engineering and management science at northwestern university he can be reached at reports wsj com
