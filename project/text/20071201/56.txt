politics &amp economics afghan tradition masks political ambush at a gathering of village elders the u s helps set in motion an enemys downfall zerok afghanistan the villagers handed out red roses the elders lined up to welcome guests to their ancient tradition the shura and john gibson a u s army captain with sunburned cheeks warmly embraced haji taday a tribal leader with a black abe lincoln beard but what looked like a reunion with an old friend last month was really a political ambush of a bitter enemy "he takes us for fools " capt gibson smiling slightly said minutes after hugging mr taday "we just got enough evidence to move against him " in afghanistans insurgency politics is warfare by other means u s officers knew that if they wanted to take down mr taday both a major figure in the local taliban and chief of zeroks council of elders they would have to avoid cultural missteps that could hand propaganda victories to their enemies so for the next hour u s and afghan officials used the shura a traditional pashtun gathering of respected senior villagers to discredit mr taday before his peers and engineer his downfall they succeeded but not in the way they expected capt gibsons boss lt col michael fenzel commander of the st battalion of the rd infantry regiment set the snare hours before the elders arrived at the zerok district center in a private meeting at the adjacent american combat outpost the colonel laid out the case against mr taday before a few trusted afghan officials including both the chief of intelligence and the head of shura for paktika province where zerok is located lt col fenzel had a receptive audience the afghans had their own suspicions about mr taday not least because his nephew is commander sangeen widely known to lead one of the taliban factions in the area mr taday has provided safe haven for foreign fighters who cross the pakistani border some miles away and move into zerok district according to u s and afghan intelligence reports mr taday also arranged the theft of a green ford ranger pickup truck from the afghan national police and delivered it to his nephew to use as a suicide car bomb according to u s intelligence reports at the pre shura meeting lt col fenzel told the afghan officials he wanted the police to arrest mr taday immediately but nawab waziri the provincial head elder argued that such a move on shura day would cause an uproar the colonel agreed to hold off and the group headed next door to the shura at the district government office a single story building with broken windows surrounded by a stone wall topped with razor wire mr taday was waiting for them in the courtyard lined up with the other elders appearing to be in his s short and rotund he wore a gray tunic and loose trousers with a long brown vest and dirty white turban striped delicately in black despite the friendly embrace mr taday knew he had been in the captains sights for months in july insurgents ambushed two u s afghan troop convoys near the zerok outpost leaving a pair of afghan soldiers dead afterward capt gibson summoned the zerok elders pulled mr taday into a room and yelled at him for minutes pausing only so the interpreter could translate the obscenity laced tirade into pashto "you say youre in charge and that there is security in zerok but theres not " capt gibson said at the time "either youre lying to me or youre working for them which is it " at the shura last month afghans delivered the message an afghan army officer opened with a verse from the koran an effort to show that the taliban known for their fierce interpretation of islam dont have a monopoly on faith "for years weve been fighting and killing innocent people " said mr waziri the provincial chief elder "its time we stop fighting " "innocent people get killed when the taliban attack " said the provincial intelligence chief yaseen who uses only one name "every day they fire rockets they put bombs in the roads where are the fighters coming from you elders are helping them dont sell out your country for five rupees " the afghan officials urged all of the elders to come forward with information about insurgent movements "you dont care about your country " qadar gul the subgovernor for zerok district chided them "you dont care about your area you are taliban " as the afghan officials spoke capt gibson his lip full of copenhagen snuff took care of side business he quietly radioed his men to order a symbolic artillery and mortar barrage intended to ward off potential attackers in the ridgelines above the base he relayed lt col fenzels orders that the guns fire only illumination or smoke rounds not explosive munitions that might endanger civilians and only after the shura ended from across the room the village doctor asked capt gibson when he would receive &# in promised compensation for four cows and four chickens killed in a firefight between taliban fighters and u s soldiers "it will be next week " capt gibson assured him meantime the afghans began to direct their comments more pointedly at mr taday and his body spoke of his discomfort he crossed his arms tightly and at one point dropped his beard to his chest and his head to his hands "i know you " mr yaseen said "ok you know me but im not an insurgent " mr taday responded mr yaseen and other afghan officials interrupted mr taday on several occasions a rudeness meant to diminish his stature before his peers mr yaseen challenged him to provide the names of taliban fighters to the intelligence service while mr taday continued to protest his innocence "i support the government " he said "everyone knows sangeen is a bad guy but we cant do anything about it he lives in pakistan there are no insurgents living here in zerok " last to speak was lt col fenzel "we will always conduct ourselves with respect for your culture and your religion islam " he promised the elders "as your guests we would ask for your protection " he added "my pledge to you is that our forces will always conduct themselves as guests when you know the taliban are coming let us know so we can provide security " the colonel then looked directly at mr taday "you cant be on both sides " he warned mr taday stared glumly at the floor the next day lt col fenzel got word that other shura members who u s officers say had long remained quiet for fear of commander sangeen now planned to depose him at the same time the colonel began working to secure orders from the provincial governor akram khapalwak to have the police arrest mr taday they never got the chance three days later mr taday his son and three bodyguards traveled from zerok to a nearby town where he met with the local head of the afghan intelligence service according to a u s intelligence report another son told a local official later that his father also met with american intelligence agents that day on the way home as the sun went down taliban insurgents ambushed mr tadays vehicle blasting it with rocket propelled grenades and killing all five men inside insurgents then launched rockets at the zerok outpost but missed their target by a couple of hundred yards u s troops counterattacked with a barrage of mortars and artillery killing taliban fighters thought to be the same group that had ambushed mr taday according to a u s intelligence report using live images from an unmanned spy plane the u s soldiers later watched as three trucks carried the corpses of haji taday his son and bodyguards along mountain roads and dried riverbeds back to his home village when they arrived the drivers sprinted into the houses to deliver the news and dozens of men swarmed around the bed of a pickup truck apparently to glimpse mr tadays body lt col fenzel was stunned by the turn of events he didnt think the other shura members would be bold enough to have mr taday killed so he surmised that taliban loyal to one of commander sangeens rivals had seen mr taday meet with the government spy boss and assumed that he was betraying them one afghan official with access to intelligence reports said that the killers had left a letter with the bodies accusing messrs taday and sangeen of betraying the taliban cause days later insurgent factions in the area battled each other leaving two fighters dead the official said his report couldnt be verified that night lt col fenzel called gov khapalwak and told him of mr tadays fate the governor said he would inform the local media that the taliban had murdered one of zeroks respected village elders
