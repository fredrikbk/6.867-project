weekend journal sports golf journal golf drugs and denial players scoff but performance enhancers could hit the pga if you were following the pga tours slow crawl to a drug testing policy which it finally announced a couple of weeks ago and i hope you had better things to do you would have noticed an awful lot of denial to pluck just a couple of quotes from dozens of similar ones uttered about the issue over the last year here is ryder cup captain tom lehman "maybe im naive because i have a hard time believing that anyone would cheat i really do the culture of golf is such that you play by the rules " and tour player rocco mediate "were as clean as it gets and we always have been theres no drug out there that helps you hit it yards and straight " it does seem unlikely that top pro golfers are rampantly abusing performance enhancing drugs certainly there have been no public revelations to that effect and no one ive noticed has suddenly sprouted a physique as impressive as that of say the recently indicted baseball slugger barry bonds but it is striking how similar the protestations of innocence are to the choruses of denial that arose in years past in sports like baseball cycling swimming and track that subsequently were rocked by doping scandals in baseball even after multiple instances of drug abuse were exposed the major league players union continued to oppose testing as "dehumanizing " the tours decision to begin testing next summer preceded by a similar announcement from the lpga may have been necessary at this point primarily for public relations reasons given the controversies embroiling other sports not to have a drug testing policy would have come across as benighted moreover testing gives pro golf "plausible deniability" should a scandal hit one day which it almost certainly will as epitomized by the quotes above from messrs lehman and mediate golfs drug denial usually takes two forms golfers just dont do that sort of thing and there arent any drugs that would help golfers anyway but that second proposition is dead wrong which sooner or later is going to severely test the validity of the first "all else being equal there arent many sports where a good big man or woman doesnt have a significant advantage over a good small man or woman " says charles yesalis the author of "the steroids game" and professor emeritus of health and human development at penn state by big he isnt just talking about stature he is talking about strength and power dr yesalis is among many doping experts who believe its absurd even to suggest that banned substances couldnt be an enormous benefit to golfers in trying to explain why golf could never have a doping scandal players tend to focus narrow mindedly and without much understanding on big dose anabolic steroids the notion is that steroids whether injected taken orally or applied in cream form would build up muscles so massive that a fluid swing becomes impossible dr yesalis calls this argument fallacious similar to the antiweightlifting argument golfers made before tiger woods and others proved how beneficial being buff can be clearly a golfer doesnt want to develop the physique of a division i linebacker that would be detrimental " dr yesalis says "but a pound player could use low doses of steroids or a testosterone cream to help him add pounds of lean flexible muscle to his body please tell me how that wouldnt help him to hit the ball farther " in such low doses dr yesalis said steroids would have negligible if any effect on a golfers ability to concentrate or stay calm another contention frequently made by those who argue that golf and doping are inherently incompatible nor would they necessarily be detrimental to the golfers long term health synthetic hormones like human growth hormone or hgh which also would be banned under the tours testing protocols are routinely prescribed by doctors for middle age people looking to build or retain strength for golfers one of the prime benefits of low dose steroids or hgh would be to let them practice longer long sessions at the range produce microtears in the bodys tissues especially as players get older slow recovery from these sessions is an obstacle to performance banned drugs could speed up the recuperation other types of banned drugs such as ritalin and beta blockers could help golfers stay calm under pressure or achieve a mental edge beta blockers which some players including nick price have taken for their heart conditions may have as much or more downside effect as upside effect on golf performance but that doesnt mean there arent other psychoactive chemicals out there that individual players might find effective players with legitimate medical need for banned drugs including testosterone supplements can apply for therapeutic exemptions under the tours announced protocols the tradition of golfers playing by the rules and even calling penalties on themselves is undoubtedly one of the games grandest and most admirable attributes but given the increasing sophistication of every other aspect of player performance these days from advanced physical and mental game training to precise technology aided club fitting how long can it be before at least a few players give in to the temptation of better living through chemistry if they havent already the most likely candidates would be young low profile pros scrambling for any advantage to make it to the tour or to stay there the culture among young pros is already gym oriented and the financial incentives to push the envelope are high this year the lowest ranked player to automatically keep his playing privileges mathias gronberg had official winnings of &# which is just the start of the money flow once youre in the big show and the fall from grace back to the lesser tours is precipitous and whos to say the big stars especially those getting on in years wont be similarly tempted the way baseballs aging elite has been the penalties for getting caught could be stiff the tour will have the authority to suspend players for up to one year for a first violation five years for a second violation and forever for a third violation plus levy fines of up to &# but for all that golfs integrity may still be its best defense a determined player with a good adviser still could probably avoid detection according to dr yesalis the tests for many substances such as hgh are notoriously unreliable and low but effective doses of steroids still could fly under the radar email me at golfjournal wsj com
