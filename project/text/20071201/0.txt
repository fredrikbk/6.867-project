ah a whiff of maybe not so fresh sea air shifting fuels for ships sounds easy "danger at sea ships draw fire for rising role in air pollution " page one nov although how much energy is expended in refining the additional million barrels a day of crude oil that would be required does this solution create more pollution than it is purported to prevent can we find other sources equal to the output of saudi arabia in chamber of shipping of america csa was a member of the u s delegation to a meeting of the marine environment protection committee of the international maritime organization imo at that meeting the u s had a representative participate in the initial session of the working group formed to address air pollution in three days delegates from around the globe agreed to mandate controls on ozone depleting substances volatile organic compounds at sea incinerators sulfur oxides and nitrous oxides the international treaty was completed in and is currently in force the parameters agreed to then arent stringent by current standards that is why the imo is now engaged in discussions on steps to make the requirements more robust it doesnt seem that five years is a prolonged time to develop international requirements that affect all vessels what isnt timely is the accession to that treaty by the u s the senate foreign relations committee has given its approval we are waiting for the senate to act on advice and consent the treaty allows the u s to establish sulfur emission control areas using limits that the u s deems appropriate why does california have to act when the opportunity is there for the entire nation to benefit lets accede to this treaty and get on with the task of improving our air quality joseph j cox president chamber of shipping of america washington your article noted that the u s environmental protection agency "has urged the imo to tighten international controls " the epa proposal is in fact a quite comprehensive proposal to address the issue and it is the most aggressive and environmentally effective proposal made by any government at the imo it addresses new engine standards and fuel standards and it effectively addresses sulfur oxides nitrous oxides and particulate matter pollution without adding to carbon dioxide emissions furthermore this u s proposal has the strong support of the california air resources board the american association of port authorities and the world shipping council which represents the ocean carriers operating over of the containership industry while it is true that some sectors of the maritime industry dont support this proposal the liner shipping industry believes that such resistance is short sighted an environmentally effective international solution to this issue is needed and our sector of the industry fully supports this u s effort christopher koch president and chief executive world shipping council washington oil fired ships are the least polluting carriers of cargo on a per ton mile basis compared to air cargo transport ships produce only to the amount of carbon dioxide per ton mile as the most efficient air cargo liners the modern diesel prime mover coupled with an appropriate heat recovery system such as the one you noted aboard the evelyn maersk is the most efficient power plant available and results in the least carbon footprint using nuclear powered ships on dedicated routes to carry long haul cargoes would alleviate the need to use fossil fuels thus preventing the formation of carbon dioxides particulate matter and other pollutants such as sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides jose femenia p e professor of marine engineering u s merchant marine academy kings point n y
