weekend journal food &amp drink eating out googling lunch dining on fresh wasabi and low fructose soda at google headquarters mountain view calif the closest thing to an alpine vista i saw in this spielbergian silicon valley suburb minutes south of san francisco was the gentle upward slope of a former landfill now providing green space for golfers and for the geeks who toil here to digitize our lives but who needs mountain views in a place with google sponsored wi fi transmitters on utility poles and a city sponsored game of mock robberies staged in real banks to train tellers to protect those cyberbillions from outsiders like me actually my raid on local riches was a strike at the guts of mountain views biggest richest target google inc i ate lunch at the googleplex and didnt pay dont worry i did not compromise the journals ethical standards which prohibit accepting meals and other things of value from sources nobody else paid either at the plexs food venues three more will open next year theres no bill no cash registers and no guilt this is one place where there really is a free and healthy lunch and a free dinner or breakfast or a snack at any time of day or night for notoriously workaholic googlers and any guests they invite my official press contact jennifer johnson said that many employees eat three meals a day under the roofs provided for them by google founders sergey brin and larry page food is only one of many services available others include free dry cleaning free birthday massages and special parking spots for expectant moms i didnt know enough to bring along my creased suits or a pregnant friend so i wouldnt have to search for a space in the crowded lot at plymouth st i was there for a lunch date with john dickman global food service manager and ms johnson a harvard trained east asian area specialist with fulbright funded study in china behind her they took me to pure ingredient cafe which in the words of the google cafe map is "a journey towards pure clean additive and chemical free food and beverage " like the other cafes i visited pure ingredient was a smallish cafeteria open to any googler who felt like stopping in for a bite it was the day before thanksgiving the trays sparkled in the bright colors of the google logo and a line of hungry cyberproles formed just after noon in the kitchen executive chef scott giambastiani had turned out nine juicy pound turkeys in an hour and a half inside seriously efficient gas convection ovens brand named rational wouldnt you know the turkey was just as tasty as the bird we ate on thanksgiving at downtown san franciscos ambitious one market mr giambastiani could have been a contender in the big time of northern californias restaurant "free world " he came to google via peppy viognier in nearby san mateo a renowned cal french restaurant launched by san francisco star gary danko now instead of a prize winning wine list mr giambastiani bottles his own low fructose agave syrup based sodas and housemade tabasco style hot sauce with its own wiseacre label "no humans were abused in the testing of this product" pizzas and pretty much everything else on offer at p i are also produced the day theyre served at the salad section line cooks toss individual salads for staffers and around the corner a sushi station creates fresh items a la minute and the wasabi is as fresh as it gets no reconstituted green paste for google gourmets at p i lunchers grate whole roots with authentic japanese sharkskin graters the kitchen is deliberately small so that it can produce only modest quantities and leaves little waste what is left over gets reused in new dishes for dinner old cooking oil is handed off to a biodiesel manufacturer and some of the new fuel makes its way back to google frankly i had to suppress a cynical shudder at all this goody goody slow foodie wholier than thou menu ideology then i tasted the low fructose cola it wasnt coke but something in that ballpark maybe even better the pie was fine the housemade dried pineapple slices had the al dente chewiness and bright flavor that only a fresh product flaunting the date hour and minute of its creation on the package could attain "get real dude " i told myself falling into geekspeak "this is a company cafeteria what would you rather have frozen fish fingers with a shelf life of eternity " the soups and pies are way tastier than youd get at a chain and no vegan enforcer is making anyone drink the icky green wheat grass potion at the other cafes we were able to visit a similar spirit of nutritional athleticism prevailed but each venue had its own spin to offer on food in a new age charlies started out as the brainchild of charlie ayers private chef to the grateful dead and then to googles first employees mr ayers left google in to preach the green food gospel but at the googleplex charlies survives as a crowded cosmopolitan center of world cuisine passing through it we detected none of the ingestibles associated with the dead although out in the courtyard we wondered what mr brin consumed the day he commissioned the bronze t rex that glowers at the beach volleyball court set up like a giant sandbox across from the building where the billionaire has his office one silicon valley veteran we met said that standards had slipped at google from the early days when mr ayers ran the only kitchen still where else but the plex can you zip around on a bicycle and choose from multicultural comfort food cafe moma american regional food the american table small plates pintxo entrees made with five ingredients or less ive and dishes based on raw materials supplied from within miles of mountain view caffe did we see messrs brin and page chowing down with the troops we didnt but we believed it when we were told they do google assertedly has no executive dining room with waitstaff pouring cabernet from crystal decanters i tapped out what youre reading on googles web based word processing program google documents the software is free like google lunch i wonder whats on the menu at microsoft headquarters in redmond wash i had to buy windows vista the least bill gates could do is send me a burger thats something thats not easy to come by at google
