come on " says mr anderson who got the call last christmas season "i thought wow im really going to get in trouble now if i dont deliver the silk pajamas or the nice little pashmina she picked "

by a louis vuitton store and went out on a limb and just went in and bought her a purse " he says "and she had it already i was kind of like this is why i dont go shopping for you because i dont know what to get " mr barber whose wife is setting up a wish list at searle said he doesnt mind that the store plans to call him its that kind of response thats driving many retailers to offer the service

essentially sending someone to ask hi could you go get me this please " says anna post the great great granddaughter of emily post and an etiquette specialist with the emily post institute of burlington vt which produces books and seminars on manners "a gift should be about the relationship between the giver and the receiver when you have a middleman like that it becomes a business transaction " some of those who sign up for the services disagree arguing that the store as intermediary makes the suggestion appear less pushy lisa tilstone a year old market researcher in new york says having a third party call her father and dictate her wish list serves the dual purpose of eliminating his potential objections and helping her get what she wants "if its someone else telling him about it he wont respond like oh thats too expensive " says ms tilstone who created a wish list with the caravan boutique "this time he may be more likely to go in and look at my items without passing judgment " rachelle anderson who sent her husband the suggestion about silk pajamas says shes simply trying to help him "the first time steve showed up at my door he brought me those flowers you get at the gas station that are wrapped in plastic and have the &# sticker on them " she says "thats what he comes up with on his own " she believes that in recent years hes spent weeks agonizing over

vice president at a bank she signed on to have the caravan boutique notify him because "theres something nice about that instead of me being presumptuous " though she doesnt know it yet ms ross will
