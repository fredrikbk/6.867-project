issue that all businesses have to deal with after all victims will blame the company that provides the service no matter whos at fault in the theft security policies get in the way the least effective way to improve security is to issue a policy prohibiting risky behavior especially if that risky behavior is something employees think makes them more productive weve long thought this is true now theres evidence a survey by the ponemon institute a privacy think tank asked information technology pros if their companies prohibited certain behaviors and then it asked if the pros engaged in those behaviors anyway in many cases the answer was yes to both the takeaway isnt that companies need to crack down on policy enforcement its that they need to rely on something other than policy for
