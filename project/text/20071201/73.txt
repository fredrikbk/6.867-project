the week ahead our take on coming events autos pessimism over could crimp production by mike spector auto makers report november sales results monday and most analysts predict the industrys annual selling rate will track about million cars and light duty trucks roughly a million fewer than the industry has enjoyed for most of this decade somber as that may be most industry players are focused on next years increasingly pessimistic outlook amid continued market pressures is poised to deliver the worst auto sales results in years a wachovia capital markets survey found about of dealers plan to cut new vehicle orders going forward a jump from in september the last time the survey was done the survey sampled three dozen auto retailers nationwide "our orders for january are going to be very minimal " says bob thibodeau who heads a ford motor co dealership near detroit "we just have got plenty of inventory to carry us through december and january at this point in time " scaled back orders could affect production plans at detroits big three auto makers general motors corp and ford are expected to outline production forecasts monday gm chief financial officer frederick "fritz" henderson added to the industrys pessimism thursday telling wall street analysts over dinner that next years sales could slip to million light vehicles with risk to the downside other executives have posited similar forecasts gms sales are off through october and might be worse if not for big discounts on its pickup trucks gm is in the midst of a new holiday clearance sale for many of its models to spur demand analysts expect gm ford and chrysler llc to post november sales declines while big asian companies toyota motor corp honda motor co and nissan motor co are expected to remain flat housing woes and high energy prices are weighing on consumers keeping them out of dealerships slowing home construction damps sales of profitable pickup trucks while declining home prices deprive shoppers of equity to finance big ticket purchases such as cars those problems to the chagrin of dealers and manufacturers are most pronounced in big markets like california and florida mr henderson said sales dipping into the low million range would indicate a recession such volumes could hinder restructurings at detroits big three each is mired in red ink in their core north american markets but toyota could also face pressure in the past year the japanese auto maker opened a new plant in texas to crank out pickups that have proven tough to sell in showrooms even dealers who arent pulling back on orders worry that next year could be a dog for sales "the last couple of quarters have been challenging " says pete delongchamps a spokesman for group automotive inc a dealership chain based in houston "if you take a look at products for next year i dont see any game changers do you " mr delongchamps hopes good diversification will keep his company from too much suffering in the year ahead toyota and lexus brands which havent been hurt nearly as much as domestic brands make up of the chains business he said climate bali talks aim to set path for post kyoto pact by jane spencer and john mckinnon when the united nations climate change conference kicks off next week in bali indonesia delegates will be riding bicycles between meetings and shedding their suit jackets to save energy on air conditioning the u s delegation eager to convey a new spirit of cooperation on the issue will be going casual "any chance i get to break out the flip flops i take " says james connaughton chairman of the white house council on environmental quality who will be representing the u s at the bali conference bikes and flip flops are a starting point for offsetting the metric tons of carbon dioxide expected to be generated during the day meeting which begins monday but the delegates have a considerably larger task at hand in trying to rein in the more than billion metric tons released on the planet each year an output linked to rising temperatures and everything from water shortages to species extinction the bali conference aims to jump start the two year process of forging a new global climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol which expires in but with major carbon emitters like china india and the u s signaling they will keep up their historical opposition to kyoto based proposals that require them to make binding emissions cuts expectations for tangible results are low and to some degree major negotiations are on hold until the u s presidential election next year since the next administration may have vastly different ideas on climate change as a result the bali conference will largely focus on logistical issues like laying out a timetable for negotiating the next agreement rather than on the substance of the next deal the u s and the european union introduced a wrinkle friday with a proposal to eliminate tariffs on a wide range of pollution reducing technologies and services the proposal is part of the doha round of trade negotiations but u s officials see the tariff elimination plan as crucial to getting a kyoto follow on agreement too the white house wants to establish an international "clean energy" fund as part of the post kyoto accord to help emerging countries like china and india pay for cleaner and more efficient buildings power plants and other facilities eliminating tariffs is important to make that financing plan work u s officials say but the u s e u proposal faces complications as some emerging countries like brazil might want to reduce tariffs on biofuels like ethanol something the developed countries have resisted the slow pace of climate negotiations and the challenge of reaching consensus among the nearly nations expected to participate in the bali conference has led some economists to speculate that the next international climate policy could actually happen outside the official u n framework that created kyoto instead it might be cobbled together by informal deals less encumbered by a centralized process while the loose network of climate policies would not replace a global treaty it could result in a parallel system for reducing emissions with an international reach in recent years more than a dozen small scale emissions trading schemes have popped up at the regional national and state levels and the number is growing rapidly in addition to the well established european union emissions trading scheme norway and switzerland have launched independent cap and trade systems in the u s about northeastern states have created the regional greenhouse gas initiative a trading system that reduces emissions from the electricity industry the u s senate is considering a handful of bills to produce a national emissions trading system experts say links among these markets could quickly effect an informal patchwork agreement that would involve most of the major economies and major emitters in the developing world long before the formal negotiations are completed many of these new carbon markets are already linked to developing countries including india china and brazil because the programs allow companies to offset their own emissions by financing clean energy projects in the developing world robert stavins a professor of business and government at harvard university will be presenting the patchwork idea during a side event at the bali conference "it could be the de facto post kyoto climate policy architecture " mr stavins says "because it just happens from the bottom up " opec either way output choice carries risks by neil king jr opec oil ministers will face the classic quandary when they huddle this coming week in the united arab emirates do you boost production and risk oversupply or keep the taps steady and possibly help nudge the u s into recession the dilemma isnt a new one but with prices at near record highs and the u s facing a real economic slowdown the consequences are weightier now than they have been in years ministers of the member group which supplies about of the worlds oil needs are sending mixed signals going into wednesdays extraordinary meeting some hint that the organization of petroleum exporting countries will repeat its september action and boost its output quotas by an additional barrels a day others insist that the market has plenty of oil and that current prices have nothing to do with supply the most important voice that of saudi oil minister ali naimi is much more in the latter camp but mr naimi has declined in recent days to say whether he favors a production increase or not saudi arabia the worlds largest oil supplier is also the only country with any sizable surplus capacity there is a danger in whatever decision the opec ministers make oil traders and analysts widely expect that the group will agree to boost output this coming week if it does and demand in the u s drops amid an economic slowdown oversupply could send prices falling that would be good for consuming countries but bad for opec if the group decides to keep production where it is near million barrels a day that could send prices sharply upward again traders say that an expected output boost already has been factored into the price which has declined about over the past five days after breaking &# a barrel in intraday trading the previous week u s benchmark crude closed friday at &# a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange some analysts predict that an opec decision to maintain the status quo may be enough to rocket oil over the &# a barrel mark so what will opec do that may depend on where prices are heading on the day the ministers meet "if prices are falling and there is momentum behind the fall they will probably pass on adding more supply " says adam sieminski chief energy economist for deutsche bank ag "but if prices are going up they will add something " opec claims it has no influence over prices but at the same time saudi arabia in particular doesnt want to be seen as standing by if oil prices soar and the u s economy stumbles into recession
