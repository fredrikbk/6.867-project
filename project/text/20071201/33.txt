gorbys choice he brought democracy to russia so why is he backing putin the man undoing his legacy st petersburg russia the last president of the soviet union was in this city recently to open a cancer center dedicated to his late wife a local television reporter asked would you consider this &# million clinic one of the most important achievements in your life mikhail gorbachev took a breath the journalist posing the question looked too young to remember his years in power "its one of the most important post presidential ones " mr gorbachev corrected a twinge of impatience in his voice "my most important achievement is perestroika moving from the totalitarian system to democracy and of course a foreign policy that led to the end of the cold war " two decades ago mr gorbachev was reshaping the world he opened up the soviet system helping to free the nations of eastern europe and end the cold war other titans of the age ronald reagan margaret thatcher left the world stage with honor mr gorbachev years old when he stepped down as soviet president in plunged into a political purgatory in the west though lionized for destroying communism he was also seen as having capitulated to the americans at home the soviet union collapsed as his reforms took on a life of their own russians scorned him russias first president boris yeltsin marginalized and humiliated him to raise money mr gorbachev did a pizza hut commercial so he responded warmly when mr yeltsins successor president vladimir putin extended him invitations to the kremlin a semi official post and words of encouragement for mr gorbachevs own political party mr gorbachev has returned the favor with a stream of endorsements of mr putin but as mr putins kremlin has steadily chipped away at the central elements of mr gorbachevs legacy media freedom open elections even the arms control agreements that sealed the end of the cold war that relationship increasingly presents a dilemma openly attacking mr putin would be a ticket back to political siberia continuing to defend him jeopardizes mr gorbachevs credibility so the former president now has sought an ever narrowing middle ground supporting mr putin even as he criticizes his kremlin "i think hes secretly worried" about his legacy says dmitry muratov a close family friend and editor of the newspaper novaya gazeta "the values of perestroika theyre being savagely destroyed " the threat to those values will be on vivid display this weekend in russias parliamentary elections with opponents sidelined and muzzled the pro kremlin party is expected to win by a landslide on sunday mr putin has said he might become prime minister after his presidential term ends next spring or seek another way to remain what allies call russias "national leader" and what critics deride as a modern day czar as liberty recedes in russia mr gorbachevs stance raises a question is the former soviet president a savvy politician who sees democratic instincts in mr putin that his critics have missed or has he been seduced by the kremlins attentions into becoming an apologist for the former kgb agent who is undoing the revolution mr gorbachev began "its very much to the benefit of the kremlin to use gorbachev and he allows himself to be used this way " says lyudmilla telen a journalist and gorbachev friend who edits a small internet news site "he will keep balancing as long as he can " the former president says he isnt being manipulated "i think putin is a democrat " he says in an interview some "authoritarian" steps were needed he says to restore order after the chaos of the s he credits mr putin with rebuilding russias living standards and international prestige "this isnt the democracy that we will ultimately get to its a transitional democracy " mr gorbachevs support of mr putin may surprise many in the west but that cognitive dissonance reflects the gap between how russias past years are viewed at home and abroad many outside russia see the s as a time of democratic promise for moscow inside russia it was seen as a decade of deprivation and chaos like millions of russians mr gorbachev wanted the end of communist totalitarian rule not of the soviet union itself he believes the west took advantage of russias weakness in the s and is now uncomfortable with mr putin who has returned it to strength mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev started out as a combine driver in southern russia he rose though the ranks of the communist party to become its general secretary the most powerful person in the u s s r he introduced glasnost or openness in media and political debate and encouraged once suppressed dialog about stalin era crimes in he won the nobel peace prize for his contribution to ending the cold war mr gorbachev blames boris yeltsin for derailing perestroika his policy of economic reforms and dissolving his country out from under him in within days of giving up his post mr gorbachev was evicted from his moscow apartment the first of years of petty humiliations dealt out by the kremlin the government kept his pension for much of the s at the equivalent of &# a month he says the new russian government had promised office space for his gorbachev foundation which is devoted to political studies as mr gorbachev fiercely attacked the new president the kremlin raised the rent and forced him out mr gorbachev says he paid for a new building with proceeds from international lectures and the pizza hut ad his efforts to rebuild a political following foundered as millions of russians blamed him for the economic collapse that followed the soviet unions demise he ran for president against mr yeltsin in and got of the vote he blames the yeltsin kremlin for silencing his campaign polls show russians still overwhelmingly think he had a negative impact on their country mr putin however had none of the personal history that poisoned relations between messrs yeltsin and gorbachev he was respectful and solicitous of the former soviet president from the start in mr putin by then russias prime minister called mr gorbachev to offer assistance when mr gorbachevs wife raisa fell ill with leukemia and needed treatment in germany mr putin attended raisas funeral mr yeltsin didnt in the russian presidential election mr gorbachev initially dismissed mr putin as a yeltsin clan creation and supported a rival but he says mr putin whod been in national politics for less than a year gradually won him over mr putin invited mr gorbachev to his inauguration in the kremlin and months later to a private meeting to discuss politics mr gorbachevs first as former president the new president also encouraged mr gorbachev to form his own party which became known as the social democratic party the former president says the personal detente served mr putin well in public mr gorbachev repeatedly insisted that the new leader wouldnt thrust russia back to authoritarianism the endorsement was important in foreign capitals mr putin was still a cipher abroad where his pressuring of the media and political rivals had raised concerns in mr putin asked mr gorbachev to run the russian side of the st petersburg dialog a semi official discussion group between russian and german business and cultural leaders that mr putin had set up with german chancellor gerhard schroeder at the dialog sessions heavily covered in both countries media mr gorbachev has defended the kremlins record on press freedom and other issues he has also contributed commentaries to western newspapers last year defending the kremlins controversial initial public offering of shares in state oil giant oao rosneft meanwhile in other venues mr gorbachev attacked government attempts to centralize control of the political system and rein in the media mr gorbachev has long helped fund novaya gazeta one of russias last remaining independent newspapers the muckraking paper with a limited reach has seen three of its reporters murdered in recent years in shortly after mr putin became president the government began pressuring the tycoon who owned ntv russias main independent national tv network to give up control mr gorbachev agreed to lead an advisory board of prominent figures the tycoon set up to parry the kremlin assault the former president spoke out harshly as the campaign intensified at one point saying "the democratic reforms of the last years are at risk " but after each meeting at the kremlin he publicly refused to blame the president insisting that mr putin remained committed to a free press in russias state owned gas company took over the tv network and replaced most of its news staff ntv adopted a staunchly pro kremlin line "when i hear him calling putin a democrat i want to break something " says yevgeny kiselyov a top ntv journalist who helped recruit mr gorbachev to the advisory board and left after the takeover though mr gorbachevs position was too soft for mr kiselyov and others it was too harsh for some in the kremlin officials involved in the episode say his access to the president was reduced his criticisms of the kremlin now get little media attention and hes rarely shown on state controlled television recent appearances have been edited aides say to exclude attacks on the kremlin kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov says president putin values objective criticism and mr gorbachevs "positive assessments" of mr putin earlier this year mr gorbachevs social democratic party was shut down under a new kremlin backed law on political parties that effectively eliminated dozens of opposition groups mr gorbachev refused to fault mr putin "i dont think the president was double dealing " he told reporters this fall few colleagues share that view gavriil popov another social democratic leader sat silently next to mr gorbachev as he gave that answer "thats all wrong putin was double dealing " he said in an interview later "but its not good for mikhail sergeyevich to position himself against the president" because it would limit his freedom to maneuver mr popov was one of the prominent politicians of perestroika elected moscow mayor in he says mr gorbachev might go into open opposition if the kremlin goes too far in undermining democracy "he doesnt talk about that and doesnt want to think about it " mr popov says that moment may be nearing kremlin supported manuals for high school teachers issued earlier this year highlight the achievements of dictator josef stalin and write warmly of leonid brezhnev who presided over a tightening of state control in the s mr gorbachev is criticized for vanity and a refusal to share power with rivals in june mr putin said russians shouldnt be made to feel guilty about stalin era purges because other countries have "more horrible" pages in their histories to combat what he sees as revisionism mr gorbachevs foundation has published once secret soviet politburo documents and hosted conferences on soviet history that typically draw modest crowds of specialists in september in moscow the foundation marked the th anniversary of stalins great terror one of soviet historys bloodiest chapters at the start of the symposium mr gorbachev lamented recent efforts to portray stalins rule as "a golden age" that was later reprised under brezhnev "gorbachevs perestroika just disappears " he said the speakers who followed compared stalins totalitarianism to what they called the increasingly authoritarian rule of mr putin as the day wound to a close mr gorbachev conceded alarm at the current official line "its started to smell of brezhnevism of stalinism again " he said but he denied mr putin has built an authoritarian regime "if you put all hes done on the scales the positive outweighs " he said as mr gorbachev went on in support of mr putin a woman stood up "this is more than i can take " she grumbled as she left outside russia mr gorbachevs message is even less critical of the kremlin he still spends about half his time traveling the world speaking to student and business groups on behalf of the gorbachev foundation his green cross international environmental charity and the raisa gorbacheva foundation which supports leukemia treatment in russia his agent says his speaking fee is in line with those of other former top officials such as colin powell those whove hired him put it in the low six figures internationally he retains an aura of celebrity last year he flew to the south of france with a russian billionaire friend to recruit elton john to play at a benefit fund raisers for the raisa foundation have become a fixture on the london social calendar attracting naomi campbell madonna and j k rowling this fall to raise money for green cross he appeared in glossy magazine ads for louis vuitton luggage hes still instantly recognizable though his face has softened and the birthmark on his forehead is framed now by grayer hair in the place of the late raisa their daughter irina often travels at his side mr gorbachev proudly plays the role of doting grandfather to irinas two daughters who are in their s after a sudden hospitalization late last year for a blocked artery in his neck and then a fall on his way back from the sauna at his dacha earlier this year mr gorbachev says he wants to slow down and give up some international responsibilities but in october he was on the road in the u s first stop was miami at a prep school where a wealthy parent paid his speaking fee next was a speech in louisville sponsored by the nonprofit world affairs council then a two day green cross meeting in new orleans after a day off he was in dallas for a double header before lunch he posed for photos with dozens of local oilmen and their wives at the texas oil and gas associations annual conference chairman joseph oneill iii made the introduction "all of us here are very proud of ronald reagan and his famous speech mr gorbachev tear down this wall " he said referring to mr reagans comments in berlin in the comment got the session off on the wrong foot mr gorbachev disputes that president reagan forced russia into capitulating in the cold war instead he says the movement started at home taking the floor mr gorbachev said "mr reagans first profession was as an actor and so he was speaking for the stage " the crowd laughed politely mr gorbachev then lectured them on the threat of global climate change and the need for sustainable development he catalogued what he called the misguided policies of the u s whose leaders suffered from a post cold war "victors complex " he defended kremlin policies saying the transition to democracy will take years and that the u s needs to get used to a russia that can stand up for its interests in the late afternoon mr gorbachev met students at the university of dallas before being hurried to a speech downtown for university donors at the podium he squinted and asked for the spotlights to be turned down "this reminds me of my maternal grandfather and how they tortured him with bright lights " he said referring to one of several relatives caught up in stalins terror he delivered the line as a joke the audience laughed he launched into the speech the same outline as at lunch by the time he headed for dinner at the lavish home of a top university donor his stride had slowed the next morning in his hotel suite mr gorbachev looks tired aides pack bags before the last stop on his u s tour in an interview he remembers his childhood in a village with no electricity the conversation turns to foreign policy he says that in vice president dick cheney rejected his suggestion that moscow and washington avoid toughness and work as partners

kind of spawn " he says using half of the russian phrase for "spawn of the devil " mr gorbachev says that during his last meeting with mr putin over the summer the two had a "big substantive conversation" about what mr gorbachev called russias "new stage " he says mr putin made clear the kremlin will strengthen not weaken democratic institutions "i know him well now " mr gorbachev says "hes a very normal person " his daughter irina joins the conversation her younger daughter anastasia is in her last year at university in moscow studying journalism and working part time rewriting

bodyguard the guard a former kgb agent nods irina complains that the new kremlin backed textbooks play down the tens of millions who died as a result of stalins policies "they couldnt have published
