remembrances roger b smith gm chief tried to transform auto maker but couldnt halt its decline as chairman and chief executive of general motors corp for a decade starting in roger b smith brought ambitious change to the worlds largest car maker and talked of preparing it for the st century but he often got bogged down in the business realities of the th century including the power of labor unions and the rise of japan mr smith who died friday at age in detroit was a modernizer he restructured gms sprawling operations and equipped gm factories with robots and other automation he acquired h ross perots giant data processing firm electronic data systems corp to address gms burgeoning information technology needs one of his proudest creations was gms saturn division designed to compete with honda motor co and toyota motor corp with small cars manufactured in the u s saturns first factory in spring hill tenn opened on july the day before mr smith retired he drove the first plastic bodied car off the assembly line the efforts failed to stanch gms long decline its share of the u s car market fell by the end of the s to from at the beginning of the decade critics complained that gms cars fell far short of japanese rivals in quality and that they all looked alike mr smith defended himself saying it took five years to develop new models but mr perot shot back "heck we won world war ii in four years " when gm announced mr smiths election as ceo in september he tried at first to play down any notion that he had big ideas for the company despite setbacks during the oil shocks of the s gm was still the worlds largest auto maker by far mr smith born in columbus ohio in held an m b a from the university of michigan and started at gm as a general accounting clerk he looked like the latest in the line of relatively anonymous finance experts who had run gm since the companys legendary founder alfred p sloan jr retired in "id be very surprised if there are any dramatic changes " mr smith said upon his appointment but he quickly recognized well ahead of many gm executives that the company needed a fundamental overhaul to fight off the rising japanese challenge by mr smith was telling subordinates about a sweeping vision for a new gm that involved reorganization diversification and "reindustrialization " beginning in early mr smith led a two year blitz to transform gm into a diversified high technology colossus powered at its core by a flotilla of new heavily automated car factories in the u s between and gm spent &# billion on new plants designed to operate with what was then state of the art automation mr smith ordered a wholesale reorganization of gms north american engineering operations blowing up old fiefdoms with storied detroit names such as fisher body he negotiated a groundbreaking joint venture with toyota to revive a shuttered gm factory in fremont calif and have it build small cars for both companies mr smiths hope was that gm executives sent to the new united motor manufacturing inc plant would soak up the secrets of toyotas efficient high quality production system and transplant them to gm david cole chairman of the center for automotive research in ann arbor mich says mr smith was "a strong personality almost to a fault he dominated his executive teams " in early mr smith created another sensation by announcing the saturn project conventional wisdom in detroit held that small cars made in america were born losers because of high labor costs by the late s mr smiths plans were stumbling robots in the new factories suffered from costly glitches including smashing windshields and painting each other instead of cars the reorganization of engineering and marketing produced more chaos than successful designs for new cars too many customers found that the technology design quality and reliability of gms vehicles lagged behind the competition not just japanese vehicles but also ford motor co and sometimes chrysler as gms north american profit sagged mr smith came under fire most famously from mr perot who became a flamboyant critic in mr smiths boardroom the clash between the two led gm to pay &# million to buy out mr perots shares in late less than a month after gm announced plans to cut nearly jobs by the time of his retirement as ceo in mr smiths image and his strategy for gm had suffered punishing blows michael moores sardonic film "roger &amp me " made him out to be a profit hungry monster unconcerned with the devastation gms plant closings had inflicted on flint mich in an interview with the wall street journal that ran the day he retired mr smith expressed frustration at what he described as exaggerated portrayals "the only time i foam at the mouth is when i brush my teeth " he said "ive never thrown a paper on the floor in my life " despite mr smiths ambitious efforts to change gm he was unable to make a significant dent in critical areas gm cut tens of thousands of u s manufacturing jobs on mr smiths watch but mr smith wasnt able to negotiate fundamental changes to the united auto workers pension and health care plans that in recent years have threatened to eat up gms balance sheet gms groundbreaking deal this fall to shift its uaw retiree health care obligations to a union directed independent trust was a long overdue solution to problems that had their roots in mr smiths era mr smith remained on gms board even as the company skidded into a financial crisis in the early s economic downturn he resigned his directors seat in after gms outside directors pushed out his successor robert stempel much of the gm that mr smith built has been dismantled since his departure eds and another of his acquisitions hughes aircraft co were sold to offset gms burgeoning pension liabilities eds turned out to be a profitable deal even though mr smiths dreams of integrating edss technology with gms never came to pass mr smiths faith in robots and automation to leapfrog the japanese competition has been replaced by a more deliberate effort to adopt toyotas production system which relies heavily on assembly line workers to assure quality after years operating in the red as an independent operation the saturn small car unit is now absorbed into the mainstream of gm the spring hill tenn factory will soon be building sport utility vehicles for chevrolet "people think he failed as a leader because he made some bad decisions " says the university of michigans mr cole who knew mr smith for years "but bad decisions can lead to good decisions "
