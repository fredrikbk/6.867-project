weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece a compelling civics lesson lorenzettis murals from depict the central role of good governance in forestalling war and promoting peace anatomy of a classic the sala della pace the chamber of peace is in my view one of the finest painted rooms in the world on the second floor of the town hall of siena it was the meeting place during the early renaissance for the council of the nine the elected rulers of this independent city state in central italy here they wrestled with the day to day problems of government just as in any cabinet room today what makes this room so special is that in the great sienese painter ambrogio lorenzetti c completed three murals of "war " "peace" and "good government " how did he portray these abstract concepts for "peace " lorenzetti audaciously painted a foot panorama of siena extending the full length of the room all is in constant movement we see peasants coming to market their donkeys laden with bales of wool we see farmers driving pigs to slaughter or returning with sheep they have purchased builders work high up on scaffolding no one is idle the perspective of the city is a tour de force a great advance over the work of giotto lorenzettis celebrated florentine predecessor for their time these are convincing representations of architecture situated in a pictorial space that re creates our own space houses palaces and workshops are occupied by busy craftsmen who are proportionate in scale while some buildings are grander than others with marble windows and painted loggias this is not an ostentatious city but a working one whether of gray stone or red brick the buildings are in sober harmony yet it seems a joyful city a woman waters the potted plants on her roof terrace birds sing in their cages and in the piazza nine richly costumed figures dance in rhythm to a minstrel with his tambourine the city wall bisects the panorama to its right the bustle continues along the crowded road into the countryside a noblewoman rides to the hunt accompanied by her falconer the fields are plowed wheat is sown harvested threshed and milled donkeys carry bales of woven cloth to the fulling mills returning it to be dyed in the city not a square inch of this peaceful landscape is uncultivated its gently rounded hills rising above a valley dotted with country villas and working farms no artist outside china had painted town or country so realistically and nowhere on such a scale on the opposite wall the only business is "war " in a wild landscape whose precipitous peaks are surmounted with ruined castles a torrential river flows through a ravine across which two armies maneuver to do battle for a bridge within the city only the armorers workshop is open men with pickaxes demolish a building the perspective is confused the houses are decorated in clashing colors white scarlet green and mauve in this joyless city there are no dancers only a tyrant who has set up his regime in the marketplace surrounded by a crew of vices hovering above his head is vainglory a fashionable young woman in cloth of gold her hair plaited with pearls she gazes fondly at herself in a golden mirror paired with her is gray haired avarice clad in gray rags her money bags clamped tight in a wooden vise over the scorched landscape flies fear painted to look so similar to the smoke rising from the torched farmhouses that at first you barely notice her this was a virtuoso effect in fresco where the artist paints with pigmented water onto wet plaster and must finish within hours before the plaster dries earlier artists like giotto had built up layers of color to achieve solidity of form but their brushwork was invisible lorenzetti by contrast realized that diverse effects could be achieved fear is painted as lightly as an ink wash sketch by blake or fuseli her face is a living skull striking terror in the spectator recently much scholarly ink has been spilled deciphering the allegory of "good government" on the shorter wall it seems to have been devised by dull lawyers as a diagram of the sienese constitution a stern regal figure holding a scepter represents the sienese government the council of the nine he is enthroned on a long bench amid nine virtues emphasizing her importance and an early manifestation of the separation of powers justice occupies a separate throne with the injunction "rulers of the earth devote yourselves to justice " inscribed above her head in short to maintain peace the council of the nine must govern virtuously paying special regard to the administration of justice lorenzetti must have wondered how to make this constitutional commonplace visually more compelling first he devised two cords attached to each of the two scales that justice balances with her thumbs these two strands are twined together by concord who sits below with a gentle expression she entrusts the rope to a procession of citizens through whose hands it threads toward the ruler around whose wrist it is tied they look like real individuals distinctively but soberly attired on closer inspection we notice that we cannot see the rope itself but only their knuckles which resemble the twined strands so if the citizens step out of line the "rope" of concord will simply disappear the scales of justice will be unbalanced and the rulers scepter will be jerked from his hand just what has happened in the adjacent fresco of "war " second he depicted peace in a diaphanous tunic of jade green silk reclining in the centre of the wall above the citizens she is the brightest figure in the room somewhat dreamy and reflective she is nonetheless alert then we notice that she is resting on a suit of armor and is coupled with fortitude stern upright and fully armored thus with great subtlety lorenzetti used his full artistic resources to suggest the nervous fragility of the concord between the council of the nine the citizens and the administration of justice upon which the blessings of peace depend sometimes requiring the assistance of brute force these were extremely turbulent and violent times as the council deliberated in this chamber lorenzettis frescoes warned it that a single imprudent decision could easily tip the balance between peace and war mr lubbock professor of art history at the university of essex in england is
