weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink expensive tastes the proliferation of single malt whiskies available in the u s has been a wonderful thing but it can be a bit disorienting to gift givers shopping for scotchophiles even if you know the recipients favorite malt which expression do you buy one way to cut through the confusion is to go for a bottle of rare age there is now a variety of year old scotch whiskies to choose from for sheer extravagance the present will be remembered at least thats the impression i got at a washington liquor store when i asked if it had the macallan the salesman brought out a cardboard box that contained the fancy blue presentation box that contained the bottle with a look that said "you cant be serious " he held the box up to display the price scribbled on the cardboard &# a week later i was in new york and picked up several other year old whiskies at the park avenue liquor shop which as it happens is on madison avenue premium scotches being that stores speciality no one blinked at my purchases is the macallan which so raised the clerks eyebrow in washington worth the damage to ones wallet in the simple market definition of value somethings worth what someone will pay for it or at least what enough people will pay so that the supply is consumed and in our current gilded age several hundred dollars hardly counts as a stratospheric expense for a luxury item that takes years to make but theres a more intuitive definition of value in which one asks whether whisky a which costs times whisky b is really times better than b the year old macallan is a luscious richly sherried dram round malty and reasonably complex great age brings an even deeper richness and complexity but the improvement is subtle is that worth the additional cost there are times when even slight improvements warrant tremendous expense it is said of fighter jets that a massive amount of their cost comes from squeezing out the last percentage point or two of performance but that means the difference between winning and losing a dogfight happily the comparative value of whiskies is not a question of life and death which is why in most instances i would take a case of the younger stuff rather than a bottle of its much older sibling but there are exceptions in tasting a variety of year old whiskies i found one malt that wasnt just improved with wizening it was transformed but first a little personal history is in order a year or two out of grad school i asked for some tutoring in whiskies from a restaurateur whose selection of single malts was vast he went to the shelves behind the bar and with a sly smile pulled down a bottle of laphroaig after explaining to me that it was pronounced la froyg he said simply "learn to drink this and everything else will be easy " laphroaig is described as a "challenging" whisky and i certainly found it to be so but i was determined and learned not only to withstand the big opening blast of peat fueled fire but to enjoy the signature taste of seaweed soaked in iodine that follows the initial assault what happens when you take a phenolic tarry and medicinal whisky and let it soak up years of fruit from sherry casks i wondered if the result might be incoherent or even a little pathetic like a declawed mouser but no the year old laphroaig is neither befuddled nor enfeebled all the character and flavor of the original is there joined flawlessly with a deep sherried sweetness its the whisky equivalent of the improbable pairing of the fiery and uncompromising saxophonist john coltrane with the velvety baritone of balladeer johnny hartman if i had to pick a few records to keep me company on a desert island the coltrane hartman disc would be among them if i had to choose a desert island whisky the laphroaig would be it and thats even before price is considered not only was the laphroaig my favorite of the tasting but it was the best value at &# there was nothing show offy about its sticker i also particularly liked the talisker a wonderfully peppery peaty malt the talisker also shows what can happen when a brash iconoclastic whisky is given long careful tutoring in the barrel but the change is one of excision not addition the salt and cinnamon that distinguish talisker are still there but less assertively making room for a clear clean taste of the original grain to come through very few whiskies survive so long in the barrel the malt gets marred with too much resin from the wood evaporation steals and weakens the spirit but if the rare slow maturing cask is carefully tended the whisky can be well worth the wait and even the price email me at eric felten wsj com sampling year scotch delicious laphroaig &# all the peat seaweed and iodine of the original joined flawlessly with a deep sherried sweetness a desert island whisky talisker &# the taliskers trademark pepper eases off just enough to make room for a fresh clean taste of the original grain to come through very good delicious the macallan &# the same virtues found in the macallan rich round sherry in perfect balance with spicier complexities only more so highland park &# younger highland park is distinguished by a nice balance of smoke and honey at the whisky adds in bittersweet chocolate and a lovely fullness of body the balvenie &# a cask strength whisky that opens up with fruit and even flowers when one adds a touch of water
