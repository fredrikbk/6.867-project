some investors fault plan to aid home borrowers critics say rate freeze may prolong the pain lenders shares rise washington a government led plan to freeze interest rates on certain troubled subprime home loans drew criticism both from investors who foresee losses and from some analysts warning that it will merely prolong the pain of the mortgage crisis but others said the bush administration was making the right move to stave off dangers in the housing market shares of major home lenders moved higher as much as &# billion in u s subprime home mortgages with adjustable interest rates are due to reset at potentially higher rates in the coming year according to banc of america securities risking a wave of defaults by borrowers unable to afford the new monthly payments that in turn could exacerbate a wave of write offs by investors who now own those mortgages losses related to bad mortgages already have reached the tens of billions of dollars and have led to turmoil in the worlds financial markets fears that the problems could accelerate have led the u s treasury and the mortgage industry to develop a plan that would postpone the higher rates for some borrowers the success of the plan details of which are still under discussion may hang on the many investors in securities backed by mortgages a coalition of lenders negotiating with the administration includes investor representatives but the securities are held world wide and it would be impossible to get everyones approval a deal could also spark lawsuits from investors who believe theyre being cheated out of their money unlike in years past when just a bank and a borrower were involved in a mortgage todays loans have been bundled together sliced into securities and sold to investors that has created problems for officials trying to help borrowers because so many parties are involved alan fournier a fund manager at pennant capital management llc chatham n j predicted that the plan being pushed by the treasury department will prolong the pain of the housing slump he said it would merely delay inevitable foreclosures for some people who cant afford their homes while allowing holders of mortgage backed securities to put off marking down their assets "this reduces the pressure short term to bring everything to a clearing price " mr fournier says "we really just need to let it wash through " most subprime loans which go to borrowers with poor credit records carry an introductory "teaser" rate for two or three years before moving to a higher rate the plan would keep the teaser rate temporarily for some borrowers the outline of the bush administration plan won praise from a diverse spectrum paul krugman the liberal new york times columnist offered "kudos to the bush administration" on his blog saying that while he needed to see more details "it seems that treasury secretary henry paulson is being much more proactive on the housing mess than i expected " house financial services chairman barney frank a massachusetts democrat offered legislative help for the large scale modification of loans saying he was "encouraged by reports of progress" in efforts to help borrowers who are in danger of losing their homes the plan is being negotiated by the treasury department and a coalition of mortgage industry participants including lenders mortgage counselors and servicers the companies that collect mortgage payments many of the particulars need to be worked out including how long the interest rate freeze would last and which subprime borrowers would be eligible for relief interest rates on about two million adjustable mortgages are scheduled to jump over the next two years threatening many of those borrowers with foreclosure andy chow who manages a &# billion portfolio of mortgage bonds and other fixed income assets for scm advisors in san francisco said the success of the plan will depend on how many borrowers qualify "given what we know right now it would benefit a smaller number of borrowers than the market is assuming " he said "but if they expand this notion to include more loans such as those that havent reset but have already been delinquent or those that have already reset it could be a big deal for the markets " the stocks of financial institutions involved in the plan rose sharply in friday trading in part because of expectations that the federal reserve might cut interest rates but also because of hope that the governments plan might put a floor under the collapsing value of mortgage debt at p m in new york stock exchange trading shares in citigroup inc were up countrywide financial corp rose and wells fargo &amp co was up still the move is drawing criticism from some on wall street who say the government shouldnt be meddling in the market "theres a part of this thats just morally repugnant the problem is that the policy makers are talking to servicers about giving away other peoples money " said mark adelson a principal of adelson &amp jacob consulting llc which consults on securitization and real estate issues "its not the servicers money but shareholders and investors money " among those who stand to gain or lose the most in this plan are mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac their support would be crucial to the plans success because they are viewed as standard setters in the mortgage industry both are members of the coalition if they endorse the treasury formula for loan modifications that would make it easier for servicers to defend themselves from any challenges by disgruntled holders of securities backed by the loans being modified freddie owns about &# billion of securities backed by subprime mortgage loans and fannie holds about &# billion of such securities according to their third quarter filings those combined holdings account for about of the &# trillion or so of u s subprime loans outstanding according to trade publication inside mortgage finance other holders of securities backed by subprime loans include banks insurance companies mutual funds and hedge funds "fannie and freddie have a lot more to gain than to lose" from a program that reduces defaults and foreclosures said moshe orenbuch an analyst at credit suisse in new york if modified loan terms can prevent some foreclosures and delay others that might buy time for the housing market to begin to recover he said a temporary freeze on troubled home loans may help stave off defaults a plus for investors in mortgage backed securities but it would also reduce the amount of interest the loans are expected to pay investors losses are likely to depend on what type of security they own some own riskier slices of debt that may lose much or all of their value if a home goes into foreclosure this group might benefit from a plan that puts off foreclosures other investors might lose less from foreclosures so long as the foreclosed house can be sold for a reasonable sum "the tricky part is that you have these investors who are all spread out people owning different bonds and all different classes and changing the loans may affect different classes in different ways " said alex pollock a resident fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute and the former president of the federal home loan bank of chicago the american securitization forum which is part of the coalition and whose members issue buy and rate securities backed by bundles of mortgages had been resisting broad modifications of loans now it appears to be backing the idea of standard criteria that could be used to help large swaths of troubled borrowers "currently we are striving to develop streamlined methods of segmenting borrowers with various characteristics " said tom deutsch the forums deputy executive director in testimony before a house hearing in california yesterday peter haveles a partner at the law firm arnold &amp porter in new york said the agreements underlying issues of mortgage securities generally give the servicers discretion to modify loans if they consider that to be in the best interest of the holders of the securities he said the possible litigation isnt likely to derail the treasury plan in part because of the breadth of the coalition negotiating it a bill introduced by rep mike castle a delaware republican would temporarily free servicers from any liability for modifying loan terms "investors are still going to get a return and its in their better interest to have those loans perform rather than fail " mr castle said serena ng contributed to this article setting criteria on mortgage aid which homeowners might get mortgage help right now the mortgage industry and federal regulators are negotiating the final details which probably wont be known before the end of the year here are some of the broad parameters the potential agreement will cover subprime loans that carry a low "teaser" interest rate for the first two or three years then reset to a higher rate for the remainder of the term typically years in total in a typical case the rate would rise to around to from or that would boost an average borrowers payment by several hundred dollars a month treasury officials say financial institutions are likely to create a set of criteria including income credit worthiness and the amount of equity borrowers have in their home among other factors they will then divide borrowers into three groups those who can continue to make their payments even if rates rise those who cant afford their mortgages even if rates stay steady and those who could keep their homes if the maturity date of their mortgages were extended or the interest rates remained at the teaser rates only the third group would be eligible for help thats similar to a plan announced last month by california gov arnold schwarzenegger not likely to be included are mortgages on second homes or investment properties
