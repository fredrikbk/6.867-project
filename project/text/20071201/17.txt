chavezs electoral coup political coups dont always wear khaki sometimes they take the form of populist politicians who use "democracy" to consolidate their power thats the case in venezuela where president hugo chavez is promoting a national referendum this sunday that would give him vast new authority if he gets away with it we hope his many american enablers will acknowledge their contribution voters are being asked to approve "reforms" that amount to an overhaul of the countrys constitution mr chavez has promoted the vote despite the view of many constitutional scholars some of whom are his former allies that these amendments require the election of a constitutional assembly no matter the president announced the referendum and had his rubber stamp congress approve it this is ironic since mr chavez all but wrote the constitution himself but he has tired of its checks and balances especially its decentralized power he now wants to restore more authority to his central government communal councils will rule locally but their members will no longer be elected they will be appointed by the chavez government his name for this is "participatory democracy " which he prefers over the "representative" kind a "yes" vote will give the executive control over central bank reserves to promote his "productive economic model " mr chavez is also modifying private property rights the new standard of ownership will be "mixed properties held between the state the private sector and the communal power so as to create the best conditions for the collective and cooperative construction of a socialist economy " the state will have the right to occupy any private property that it plans to expropriate in advance of any judicial review any property deemed by the state to be nonproductive could be transferred to "public corporations cooperatives communities or social organizations " perhaps you thought this sort of thing went out of style about but mr chavez believes socialism didnt fail it just wasnt tried with enough gusto moving right along the reforms would give mr chavez the right to be re elected indefinitely and he will be able to name multiple vice presidents to govern with the communal councils the president will gain new powers to suspend due process during emergencies and the legislature will lose its role in determining how long those emergencies last to make all this go down with voters mr chavez has included in the referendum a hour work week a reduction in the voting age to and more generous welfare benefits mr chavez wouldnt be close to pulling this off if he hadnt already used his nine years in power to neuter venezuelas independent political institutions to gain control of the supreme court mr chavez increased the number of justices to from then he fired the national electoral council cne and named his own version which presided over a crooked and non transparent august recall referendum former president jimmy carter nonetheless blessed that fraud and the bush state department went along too for their part venezuelans have so little faith in an honest vote that they boycotted the legislative elections chavista candidates won of the seats in mr chavez also purged the military after it refused to fire on protestors and briefly removed him from power in that event connecticut senator chris dodd rushed to support mr chavez while ignoring the pleas of labor unions human rights activists and religious leaders that he was abusing his power another enthusiastic supporter is joseph p kennedy ii who in exchange for discounts on venezuelan oil has been promoting the president as a benefactor to americas poor despite this help from abroad mr chavezs popularity at home has been dropping sharply as venezuelans rebel against this electoral putsch students have been pushing back hard against limits on free speech and even former ally general raul baduel has called the referendum a "coup against democracy" and joined the opposition polls show most venezuelans are also opposed but a genuinely fair vote may be impossible the presidents electoral council controls the voter rolls the voting machines and the ultimate count yet whatever sundays outcome the real story of this referendum is that mr chavezs days as a venezuelan hero are over his grab for power is so blatant that it has aroused a passive public as shown by the huge and peaceful "no" rally in caracas on thursday maybe his american friends will even figure it out
