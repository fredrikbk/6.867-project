ripple effect economists see housing slump enduring longer downturn is expected to keep growth tepid retailers feel the pinch economists are giving up on the idea that the u s housing slump will be quick and relatively painless instead more are concluding the downturn that began nearly two years ago will last at least through the end of remaining a major drag on the u s economy the culprits a glut of homes for sale and growing caution among lenders who now regret being so free with their mortgages during the boom most forecasters still expect the economy to regain some momentum this year

warned that residential construction "will likely remain subdued for a time until further progress can be made in working down the backlog of unsold new homes " the market started to cool in mid after a buying frenzy that drove up the average u s home price nearly in the first half of the decade and more than doubled prices in many areas near the east and west coasts late last year some economists were saying the market would start bouncing back by the middle of that hasnt happened partly because inventories of unsold houses have continued to grow and a surge in mortgage defaults has made
