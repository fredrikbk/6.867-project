the week ahead our take on coming events apple what macs leopard system means to edgier sibling iphone by nick wingfield within apple inc s product family the soon to be released iphone is the newborn child doted on by everyone the macintosh operating system is its older sibling still loved but no longer the center of attention monday the mac will have its moment in the sun again at an annual developer conference in san francisco apple will showcase a new version of the mac operating system known as leopard which comes with an array of new features while leopard is generating considerably less buzz than the iphone the new apple cellphone that goes on sale june investors are eager to see if apple can keep up the innovations that have helped mac sales significantly outpace the growth of the pc industry as a whole apple has already acknowledged that the iphone has caused sacrifices to its mac plans the cupertino calif company originally planned to release leopard at its developer conference in mid april however apple said it had to pluck key engineers and testers off its mac team to put the finishing touches on the sophisticated software inside the iphone as a result apple said it wasnt able to meet its quality expectations for leopard in time for a june release developers that attend the conference will instead get a test version of leopard thats "feature complete " though the softwares final version wont be out until october a disappointment for many mac fans even with the explosive growth of the hit ipod music player the macintosh business is still the beating heart of apple while its computers account for only about of u s shipments of new pcs mac sales represented of apple revenue in the companys most recent quarter apple isnt a threat to the hegemony of microsoft corp s windows operating system but even small market share gains translate into meaningful new business for the company apple has already talked about a few of the new capabilities in leopard including a feature it calls time machine that will allow users to easily back up photos documents and all other data on their macs apple has also said it will integrate into leopard a program called bootcamp that lets users run windows on their mac hardware though not at the same time as mac software some analysts believe apple might surprise developers next week with a design that will let users run mac and windows simultaneously since mac software portions of it at least will also power the new iphone apples ability to keep developers engaged in the mac next week could also help the new cellphone apple chief executive steve jobs recently hinted the company will allow independent software makers to develop programs for the iphone once the company works out some security issues everyone likes to see siblings playing nicely together airlines airtrans midwest bid shows obstacles to industry mergers by paulo prada as recently as last autumn the u s airline industry was rife with expectation that a wave of consolidation was soon to sweep the sector after years of cost cutting and scaling back excess route capacity it seemed the only thing left to fully clean up the historically troubled industry was for the number of competitors to dwindle how wrong that assumption turned out to be in a sign of just how remarkably the u s airline industry has retooled itself and how difficult airline mergers are to execute only one deal appears to have a chance of happening anytime soon that is a &# million offer by airtran holdings inc to acquire milwaukee based midwest air group inc it may finally reach a climax of sorts at midwests annual meeting thursday during an eight month struggle for control of midwest in which airtran twice raised its offer the orlando fla airline has persuaded an increasing majority of midwest shareholders about as of mid may to back the deal yet midwest management which under wisconsin law can adopt a poison pill defense that would block the takeover no matter what level or support it has from shareholders refuses to even meet with airtran executives airtran hopes that will change thursday when it will ask midwest shareholders to elect three nominees it proposes for the companys board that effort got a boost recently when a handful of shareholder advocacy groups including institutional shareholder services inc recommended midwest shareholders vote for the airtran nominees who could then push the rest of the nine member board to reconsider its opposition airtrans offer illustrates a lot about the cultural obstacles to airline mergers throughout its struggle to remain independent midwest management has rallied local workers and customers against the bid tactics similar to those used successfully by delta air lines inc earlier this year against a us airways group inc bid arguing that its reputation for quality service would suffer the midwest deal doesnt have many of the operational tangles and complex employee seniority systems that also have made airline mergers notoriously difficult us airways is still grappling to integrate the workers and assets it acquired with its takeover of rival america west two years ago midwest has already missed some of the financial targets it set for itself earlier this year when it told shareholders its stand alone plan was better than a tie up with airtran the logic for a combination supporters add is based less on eliminating costs through integration and layoffs than on complementary aircraft types and route networks "there is a lot of value in putting the two companies together " says richard hurowitz chief executive of octavian advisors lp a new york hedge fund that owns slightly more than of midwests shares despite such arguments and the increasing likelihood that airtrans nominees will get elected to the board midwest remains entrenched if the airtran slate were elected said carol skornicka midwests general counsel "we hope they would come to see that our long term value is greater than the offer from airtran and see it from the perspective of the current board " shareholder activism a yahoo investor hopes to provide impetus for change by kevin j delaney yahoo inc shares have dropped about from a year ago and its revenue growth has fallen every quarter that has disgruntled some investors who plan to confront the internet companys management at its annual meeting tuesday that shareholder confab isnt expected to produce any immediate changes to the sunnyvale calif companys management or strategy but at least one activist investor believes it could add momentum to campaigns to overhaul its top brass and shift tacks high on the list of shareholder complaints is the allegedly outsize compensation of chief executive terry semel a former hollywood executive who joined yahoo in mr semels total compensation last year of &# million put him at the top of the list of highest paid ceos at standard &amp poors companies that have filed with regulators this year according to an associated press analysis of the filings proxy advisory services institutional shareholder services inc and proxy governance inc are recommending that shareholders vote against re electing members of yahoos compensation committee to its board because of concerns about what they see as excessive awards to mr semel "semel is rewarded when times are good pay for performance and when times are bad retention " wrote iss in its report mega options grants to the ceo are "particularly troubling in light of the companys recent poor stock performance and corporate performance " it added speculation has swirled for years around the timing of the retirement of mr semel who is years old but yahoo has always dismissed it a yahoo spokeswoman said the companys executive compensation is designed to "attract and retain key executive and employee talent and to link compensation to the companys performance and increases in long term stockholder value " as part of a three year arrangement mr semels salary dropped to &# in may from &# previously he was also awarded stock option grants priced at the market value of yahoo shares when granted on million shares as part of his bonus and the three year retention pact shareholder activist eric jackson of naples fla says investors holding about two million yahoo shares or less than of its capital have agreed to back his "plan b" for the company that plan includes replacing mr semel and the majority of the companys directors for missteps including failing to gain on rival google inc in search advertising mr jackson predicts heated questions from shareholders during tuesdays meeting but he says his main hope for change is for co founders jerry yang and david filo who each hold smaller than stakes in yahoo to look at the shareholder meeting votes and the companys performance and "come to the decision themselves that the company needs to move in a new direction " the yahoo spokeswoman said the company is always interested in its shareholders views but she said that mr semel had outlined a clear strategy focused on three key priorities "narrowing the gap in search monetization extending our lead in display advertising and securing leading positions in the major emerging areas of social media video and mobile access " yahoo investors tuesday will also vote on two shareholder proposals that stem from yahoos disclosure of information to the chinese government that helped lead to the imprisonment of at least one dissident one proposal calls for the creation of a board committee on human rights and the other for new company policies related to censoring and disclosing information at a governments request yahoos board has recommended that shareholders vote against the proposals saying the company is already taking measures to address such issues corrections &amp amplifications us airways group inc and america west holdings corp merged in september an
