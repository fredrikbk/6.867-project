managed cost medical care is a system of backward incentives in his june editorial page commentary "our soviet health system " robert a swerlick makes the claim that administrative pricing structures by and influenced by medicare have had an adverse effect on the supply of physicians in this country however dr swerlick does not address the question of why private insurance companies look to medicare as a framework to negotiate payments neither by law nor by government policy are they required to do so they operate in the free market and may negotiate payments based on any formula they so choose nor does medicare stand as a competitor to them regarding prices for the majority of patients only patients and over and some others with particular disabilities are covered by medicare for most others insurance companies can negotiate payments without looking to medicare so what exactly is the problem here dr swerlick offers no direct evidence to support his contention that administrative pricing structures emanating from medicare have any effect on the supply of physicians as to why there are shortages of physicians in some specialties we might look to pricing structures that were put in place long before medicare existed in fact when medicare began its payments were based on what the prevailing reimbursements were at the time set by private insurers private insurance companies long ago decided that reimbursements for procedures would be much higher than for primary care services in dr swerlicks own field dermatology the reimbursement he receives for simple procedures that take only a few minutes such as a skin biopsy far exceeds what an internist or a pediatrician is paid to sit with a patient and discuss the management of his or her various medical problems often in a visit that takes much more time than that required to do a procedure perhaps therein lies an explanation for why medical students are attracted to such profitable specialties as dermatology radiology and others that are procedure driven despite the disparities in reimbursements between the various medical specialties it is hard to believe that dr swerlicks daughter will have difficulty finding an endocrinologist when she turns a quick search via google for endocrinologists in the atlanta area where he practices produced dozens including at the school where dr swerlick teaches mark joy m d brooklyn n y at long last someone is saying in public what all of us in non procedure oriented medicine have realized for more than a decade the current backward incentives in our era of "managed cost" are reducing quality and increasing cost our system compensates medical thinking and time at a value of zero unless of course there is a procedure or imaging study involved unless a physician is procedurally oriented or owns an imaging machine the rational economic incentive is for the doctor to see patients as quickly as possible because spending time to figure out diagnoses has no economic value under our current payment system the reason one cannot find cognitively oriented specialists such as endocrinologists is that their care revolves around complex medical problems that take lots of physician time and patient education they have almost no procedures or imaging studies in their practice as a result under the current payment scheme if they are to do a good job they will be unable to produce enough revenue to keep their practices open or to pay their salaries and overhead costs they same is increasingly true of primary care doctors who operate under similar constraints as a pediatrician i could see one child with chronic abdominal pain spend an hour with him taking a good history and deciding the judicious use of tests for this service i would be paid around &# alternatively in the same time i could see six children with acute illnesses such as colds and sort throats for about &# each as is obvious the incentive is backward my time has little or no value it is far easier to refer a patient to a procedural specialist such as a gastroenterologist who gets paid a higher consultation fee and is far more likely to utilize an expensive procedure this is both costly and damaging to doctor patient relationship i am expected to buy hundreds of thousands of dollar of astoundingly expensive vaccines for which i am often reimbursed at less than real cost which is far greater than just the purchase price i then get to wait several months for payment in essence i am paying to vaccinate american children at my own expense in days when i could set my fees that was not so much of a problem today my fees are set by insurance companies and my only choice is to lose money or not provide the service for this and many other reasons i find it very difficult to advise medical students to go into primary care the current valuations of medical services under any of the private or proposed public systems suffer the same problem it is time to value services to encourage doctors to do the right thing rather than make it nearly impossible to do so and remain a viable business herschel r lessin m d medical director &amp director of clinical research the childrens medical group pllc poughkeepsie n y dr swerlick compares markets for human and animal medical services and finds the human market lacking dr swerlick may be a wonderful dermatologist and as a practitioner may know something about the shortcomings of price systems based upon medicare pricing but his understanding of supply and demand in veterinary services is unrealistically rosy what he sees is that he is willing to pay the market price for a service and gets the service quickly what he does not see is that there is a great deal of spending on veterinary care that is not helpful and may even be harmful there is little policing of the quality of veterinary care so that paying for x does not always result in receiving x a lot of animals get little or no care and suffer and die as a result what he must know but chooses to forget is that the veterinary system has a safety valve the human system lacks a pet can always be euthanized what equilibrates the supply of adolescent dogs and canine endocrinologists may not be adjustments in the supply of endocrinologists but the unwillingness of some pet owners to provide their pets with treatment the free market in veterinary care looks very different from the administered price system for human medical care on a particular day for a particular condition it may seem attractive that does not mean we would rationally choose to trade medical systems with our pets stephen snyder assistant professor of economics lehigh university prof snyders views are his own and arent intended to
