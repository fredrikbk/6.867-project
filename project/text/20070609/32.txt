pursuits books book review royal destroyer tina browns sharp biography shows how princess diana upended the monarchy the diana chronicles by tina brown doubleday pages &# camilla parker bowles the other woman in the britannic soap opera that was the marriage of princess diana and prince charles was given to signing off her letters to her princely lover as "your devoted old bag " this we learn on page of "the diana chronicles " by tina brown a page on which we also learn courtesy of a quotation by ms brown from another writers biography of the princess that "diana went for colonic irrigation to deal with her inner rage " that may be a californian sort of thing to do but this is a very british story best described using very british figures of speech about a bag a cow and a big girls blouse the "bag " per her own cheery self deprecation is camilla the "cow " a word that denotes a tiresome rancorous woman is diana and the "big girls blouse" is of course prince charles a fair if dull translation into the american of that peerless put down would be "wimp " what it has to do with blouses nobody knows except that a blouse is not a very masculine garment the clothing metaphor while colorful can prove confusing when one is reminded that the big girls blouse once told the bag longingly "ill just live inside your trousers " he then professed that with his luck hed likely do so as a tampon that would inevitably be flushed away a sad sack joke that annihilated him in public opinion tina brown spares us none of the unchaste detail in her account of dianas life written in a peppery haut tabloid style that gives readers all the dirt on charles and di and camilla and fergie remember her but with none of the narrative saliva that one might associate with grubby scandal sheets only ms brown could deploy such words as "hottie" and "propinquity" in the same sentence in her hands a trashy if delicious tale is rendered vividly mordant she writes with the feline flair of a woman who has met but not necessarily liked most of the characters in her book and who has an uncommonly good way with characterization diana in the early period of her marriage "was a work in progress while charles was a work in aspic " later on a hot night in august the last night of her life diana sets off in a car in paris "pursued by the farting motorbikes of the international press " the princess an aristocrat by birth her daddy was that "truncheon faced old buffer " the eighth earl spencer now believed only in "the aristocracy of exposure " the books greatest attraction however is its sheer wealth of detail by turns salacious vinegary depressing and hilarious did you know that queen elizabeth is referred to below stairs as "betty battenberg" it is a dig at her germanic origins or that the bulimic dianas waist shrank from inches to between the first and last fittings of her wedding dress the eating disorder was it seems triggered by a stray comment from charles about how "chubby" diana felt when he put his hand on her waist one learns that in november two years later the royal couple had an almighty row over charless "refusal to spend money on a tennis court at his highgrove estate thereby depriving diana of her sole outdoor activity " and their sex together wasnt terribly good either we read being merely a "roll on roll off" affair his royal highness ms brown writes "had difficulty locating her erogenous zones " but diana was nothing if not game to make herself alluring to charles after the birth of their second son harry she "tried to dance her way into his heart " we are told that "she would put on sexy lingerie and low music and attempt to tantalize him with a striptease he is said to have only mildly enjoyed " the source notes at the back of the book attribute this last nugget to an off the record interview with a person of undisclosed identity since we can be sure that the prince himself could not possibly have told ms brown about this private show and since his evaluation of dianas seduction dance must have itself been deeply private one can only conclude that someone very close to the prince spoke to ms brown after all a man only says this sort of thing to a friend which brings me to a larger point one that arises from a question that i asked myself once or twice as i read the book why is all this information out there the whispered revelation about the striptease a presumptive betrayal of friendship is while only a small part of a giant and furious picture emblematic of the state in which the british royal family has lived since the arrival of diana in its midst in ms brown writes "from the moment that the monarchy changed from an institution of power to one of representative virtue the thing that made it work was the palace code of silence " it was that code and more broadly the assiduously maintained distance between the palace and the people and between the palace and the press that enabled the royal family "to be familiar without breeding contempt " by pursuing a place in the aristocracy of exposure even if as an escape from a loveless marriage diana destroyed the delicate ecosystem that kept the monarchy alive in an increasingly irreverent modern democracy and held republicanism at bay as ms brown observes acutely "the house of windsors sense of itself was rocked by the princess who had crossed over to white hot superstardom and it had no idea how to protect itself from the media heat " my executive summary of diana and her role in history is that she was the person who in life and especially in death brought the british monarchy to the brink of collapse one may not necessarily admire the institution of hereditary rule however tightly circumscribed it may be by law and custom but one is inclined to be fascinated by the precipitous plummeting of its stock especially when the crash is engineered by a woman who failed her o levels the equivalent of th grade and who was thought suitable for charles by his parents on the grounds that she was the only blue blooded virgin in england so we need have no guilt about being interested in diana down to the last lurid detail as a figure of historical import since she was a woman who unleashed an epic destruction we are entitled to be interested in her as theater too and in her story as a spectacle a psychodrama a morality play a pageant of recklessness and revenge of passion and pity of loneliness and looniness above all as ms brown points out we should pay attention to diana for the effect she had on the british psyche and on british culture the national reaction to her death signified modern britains lowest moment as mass ululations issued forth from formerly stiff upper lips toward the end of her book ms brown recounts a conversation she had this year with tony blair what had dianas life signified she asked the prime minister his answer "diana taught us a new way to be british " she certainly did that and in my view it is not a better way it occurs to me that the recent debacle of the british sailors and marines taken prisoner in iran with some selling their stories and one of them claiming that he cried himself to sleep at night after his evil captors taunted him for looking like mr bean is somehow connected to the "new way to be british" that mr blair talks about but there is nothing we can do about it now the peoples princess wrought a cultural revolution alongside her havoc mr varadarajan is an assistant managing editor at the wall street journal
