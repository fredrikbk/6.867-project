cross country big easy bigger test new orleans its not often that large public institutions get a chance to rebuild from the ground up but thats more or less what new orleans public schools have had to do since hurricane katrina came ashore nearly two years ago the results may be better than many had feared when survivors were still being plucked from the flood waters in the long run the citys public schools may end up more effective at educating students than without the storm new orleans is now in the midst of the largest scale test case in the nation for charter schools so far school reformers are cautiously optimistic within months of katrina state authorities responded with a simple approach rather than sticking with a slow moving school board a wide range of charter schools were allowed to spring up such reforms were blocked in the past but after the storm dramatic moves became possible before katrina public schools catered to about students many were abysmal the state had for years threatened to take charge of the schools as test scores repeatedly showed poor performance the public school system was so lethargic that following katrina there was talk of schools remaining shut for an entire year instead the state legislature removed schools from the new orleans school boards control today public schools are open thirty one are charter schools and educate about half of the public school students the highest percentage of any school district in the country eight more charter schools will open in the city next year charter schools are independently operated public schools supported by taxes but free of many of the laws and regulations that govern regular public schools theyre held accountable for student achievement and tax dollars often follow students to the charter they attend with rare exceptions such as siblings they cannot selectively admit students or impose geographical restrictions on applicants teachers generally have no union representation work under year to year contracts and can be paid on performance not seniority in new orleans many of the students are poor and most are also black or latino according to nelson smith president of the national alliance for public charter schools the schools removed from new orleans school district control were the citys lowest performers nonetheless sarah usdin the founder and president of a nonprofit called new schools for new orleans thinks they will likely improve student performance because the organizations getting the charters were selected with greater care than in the past also the chartered schools are "truly receiving as much money per pupil as the students in all of the other schools " thats rare nationwide charters received about less says nelson smith in new orleans charters also get a building along with the right to run it "theres lots of real estate here albeit in need of work and cleanup " ms usdin says "its not like being in new york or los angeles where the charters really struggle to get a facility " so no excuses then "exactly and thats the way it should be " ms usdin told me so far the anecdotal evidence is promising at least one charter school tested its entering children and found them to be in the th percentile in reading "by mid year they had made gains up to the th percentile " according to ms usdin at the same time the recovery school district running non charter schools announced earlier this year that two ds and two fs on a city administered standardized test would count as a pass for the year school superintendent robin jarvis said that the lenient policy which has since been changed in response to a local outcry was necessary because of "the trauma that our children have been through " effective last week ms jarvis has moved to a new post with an education nonprofit organization but her successor may have another excuse most people agree that as more residents return to the city there will be a shortage of teachers on a recent trip to the city i found this labor shortage across the board though thats also a sign that the city is on its way to recovery one charter school that has found enough teachers according to its principal gary robichaux is mcdonogh located in the french quarter and run by knowledge is power program a nonprofit organization that operates schools nationwide the school has students and operates on a long monday to friday schedule a m to p m it also meets every other saturday mr robichaux filled some vacancies he told me during a visit to the school by knocking on doors in the nearby iberville housing project normally the project isnt considered a safe place to visit nonetheless he recruited students the way door to door salesmen used to sell vacuum cleaners ninety five percent of the students are african americans as are many teachers and other staff teacher salaries are in the &# to &# range about higher than in the regular public schools teachers give out their cell phone numbers to students and are expected to field homework queries each night for many its a hour day without overtime also parents must sign off on completed homework and for students there are no excuses for tardiness it is difficult to visit charter schools in this city without feeling both concern and optimism getting publicly funded entities to compete with one another is not easy and the background of many students isnt encouraging at the same time the idealism and energy that has been unleashed is impressive teachers believe they can make a difference when they are responsible for their charges and accountable for their successes and failures perhaps that will be the decisive change mr smith of the national alliance says the charter community in new orleans "is showing that its possible to build an entire system of autonomous schools of choice with high expectations for all kids " thanks to katrina new orleans may now definitively tell us how well charter schools can perform on a large scale and on short notice mr bethell is a senior editor of the american spectator
