marlboro brand goes smokeless philip morris takes a risk by selling tobacco pouch reduced exposure claim marlboro country is going smokeless for decades the nations largest cigarette maker philip morris usa has cranked out tens of billions of cigarettes annually while carefully protecting the dominance of its premiere marlboro brand long the top choice for american smokers more than of all cigarettes sold in the u s are marlboros but with smoking continuing its long slow decline in the u s the richmond va cigarette maker is about to take what could be a risky marketing gamble by introducing a so called smokeless product under its valuable marlboro brand name altria group inc s philip morris usa is unveiling a line of new smokeless products known as "snus " the product consists of a tiny pouch of tobacco similar to a miniature teabag that users place between cheek and gum it will be test marketed in dallas in august philip morris is likely to position the product as an alternative to cigarettes and to build on the notion that the product has some of the taste characteristics of marlboro cigarettes "flavor anytime " is one marketing tagline currently under consideration "not cigs not dip new snus " is another tagline the company may use the move represents a significant new direction for the nations largest cigarette maker which may be hoping that smokers will view its smokeless products as safer and less smelly and offensive than inhaled tobacco products because they potentially offer a nicotine hit with lower carcinogenic content than cigarettes moreover they can be used in offices restaurants and other indoor areas where smoking bans are spreading by moving into snus philip morris usa likely is betting it may one day be able to make so called reduced exposure claims for certain smokeless products congress is considering legislation that would enact food and drug administration oversight of tobacco it would permit marketers if they met standards set by the agency to make reduced exposure and reduced harm claims for certain products proven to expose smokers to fewer poisons than conventional cigarettes relatively unknown in the u s snus pouches are popular in sweden unlike traditional moist snuff and chewing tobacco the pouches are both "dry" and "spit free " the pouches allow the flavor and nicotine in the tobacco to seep out they come in containers of a dozen and are discarded after use a far bigger market in the u s is the so called moist snuff business also known as dip it represents the single biggest segment of smokeless tobacco and is estimated to account for roughly &# billion to &# billion in annual sales in the u s moist snuff is generally placed in the mouth between the gum and lower lip brendan mccormick a philip morris usa spokesman wouldnt say if philip morris planned to enter this market the company has very little experience making smokeless products and would face fierce competition the two largest brands in this category skoal and copenhagen each boast annual sales of more than &# billion both are owned by smokeless tobacco market leader ust inc rival cigarette maker reynolds american inc became the first major cigarette maker in recent years to push into the smokeless tobacco business when it snapped up closely held snuff and chewing tobacco company conwood co for &# billion in cash last year within months of that deal reynolds looked to capitalize on its famous camel cigarette brand by pumping out smokeless products under that name reynolds now is the second largest smokeless tobacco producer unlike the cigarette market where volume sales have fallen every year since the s smokeless tobacco volumes have been growing at an average annual rate of to for more than a decade according to research firm euromonitor international cigarette consumption fell to billion cigarettes in the u s last year according to the latest u s government statistics "while i would say a large scale switch from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco isnt going to happen its certainly true that some smokers have switched " says michael schaefer a u s research analyst for euromonitor he noted that after taxes cigarettes tend to be about to more expensive than smokeless products a difference he says "has definitely helped fuel sales growth" of smokeless tobacco in the u s the cigarette making business recently has been highly profitable for philip morris since it and some other tobacco companies have been able to raise prices to offset declining demand for cigarettes philip morris is under pressure to branch into new tobacco related fields its parent company altria group continues taking steps toward its plan to spin off the growing philip morris international business this year an announcement of the international tobacco spinoff could come as soon as the atlria board meeting in august last year philip morris began testing its first smokeless product taboka also a tiny snus pouch of tobacco that users place between cheek and gum taboka sells for &# about the same price as a pack of marlboros in the indianapolis test market and philip morris positioned that product as an alternative to cigarettes some wall street analysts and tobacco industry players suspect taboka hasnt done well in its test market "we are pleased with the results of the test market in the sense that those who have tried it have given it favorable reviews " says mr mccormick
