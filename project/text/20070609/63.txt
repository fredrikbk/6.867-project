supreme liability the trial bar never sleeps but the same cant be said for the bush administration were about to learn how much the latter has been napping when solicitor general paul clement files the administrations amicus brief in what could be the biggest securities litigation case in a generation stoneridge v scientific atlanta concerns "secondary liability " the question is whether trial lawyers will be allowed to sue not just a company that engages in wrongdoing but any company that has done business with the wrongdoer a bad supreme court decision could unleash a new wave of antibusiness litigation the case concerns a fraud by charter communications which engaged in a complicated financial transaction with several vendors of set top cable boxes including motorola and scientific atlanta charters accounting falsely inflated its cash flow and three of its executives went to jail motorola and scientific atlanta had no role in charters bookkeeping but the trial bar is suing them anyway the supreme court ostensibly put an end to secondary liability with its central bank ruling in congress has twice had the opportunity during debates on the private securities litigation reform act as well as on sarbanes oxley to allow private action for secondary liability both times it refused to do so yet that hasnt stopped the trial bar from chipping away at central bank in the courts in the ever inventive ninth circuit court of appeals expanded the definition of who could be considered a "primary violater" of the law meanwhile a federal court in houston erroneously certified a group of plaintiffs who claimed investment banks that did business with enron were "primary violaters" of securities laws the fifth circuit tossed out that case but its initiator bill lerach has appealed to the supreme court and wants the case joined with stoneridge at the same time democrats in washington are running interference on the issue mr lerach recently marched some of his enron plaintiffs around washington presenting this as a case of victims vs victimizers house financial services chairman barney frank is hauling all five securities and exchange commission members to a hearing to discuss this and other trial bar priorities the intimidation seems to have impressed sec chairman christopher cox who recommended that the solicitor generals office take a position supporting secondary liability in its stoneridge brief thats a shocker given that few people have campaigned more against frivolous securities lawsuits than the former california congressman perhaps mr cox thinks this will immunize him against accusations his sec is too pro business but in the process he had to break with his two fellow gop commissioners and side with the democrats what the sec should be explaining is the damage that "secondary liability" will do to investors tort lawyers want to establish a breathtaking new legal standard to wit that any business partner or supplier a bank say or law firm of a corporate offender either should have known of the fraud or was reckless in not knowing and thus is guilty of "aiding and abetting" fraud under such a standard this newspaper could be sued for running an advertisement in which a company misreports its earnings the supreme court dismantled this argument in central bank when it examined section b of the federal securities law which applies to people who "directly or indirectly" engage in securities fraud the court said congress never intended this language to cover secondary companies and it noted the "uncertainty and unpredictability" of trying to determine just who was liable in a civil setting and warned of the "excessive litigation" that would come not to mention the "difficulties and costs that would be experienced by client companies and investors " the stoneridge gambit has nothing to do with investor protection it is all about soaking investors by expanding the field of rich targets available for tort lawyers to sue it is precisely the sort of lawsuit lottery that will cause even more companies to decide they are better off listing their shares in london or hong kong anywhere but in the u s briefs in stoneridge are due monday and we hope someone at treasury has been awake enough to counter the secs advice the best outcome would be if solicitor general clement asks the court to reaffirm its principles in central bank and put this latest tort ruse to bed
