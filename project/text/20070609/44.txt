pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece what dominique de menil wrought the museum she built for the works she and her late husband collected turned houston into an art mecca anatomy of a classic houston houston in the s was not exactly an art destination nor when they settled there fleeing wartime paris would john and dominique de menil have been considered art collectors this after all was a couple whod casually left behind still in its original brown wrapping and stashed ignominiously on a shelf somewhere in their paris apartment max ernsts "portrait of dominique " they werent that pleased with it but houston was the site of u s operations for schlumberger the french oil field services giant that dominiques family had founded and whose world wide operations john was to direct and over the next decades the de menils evolved into serious art patrons eventually assembling more than works spanning antiquities byzantine art the arts of tribal cultures and contemporary art and yes they did subsequently retrieve that ernst portrait only the first of many ernsts and magrittes in a collection that would become known for its strong surrealist holdings before mr de menil died unexpectedly in the couple had spoken with louis kahn among others about designing a museum to house their collection mrs de menil eventually hired renzo piano the genoan architect whose sole claim to fame at the time was the outre pompidou center the beaubourg in paris that he designed with british architect richard rogers in a long storied collaboration the architect and his exacting opinionated client would fine tune the design of a building that when it opened in years before mrs de menils death at age attracted international attention and acclaim this month marks the th anniversary of the menil collection the actual date was friday in an era of monumental museums whose architectural pyrotechnics sometimes detract from the art inside mr pianos menil is a masterpiece of understated deferential elegance a museum that with a light respectful touch facilitates and enhances the experience of the art while also illuminating and remaining true to the sensibility of the collectors passing through the tree and bungalow lined area of montrose just minutes from downtown houstons exhibitionist skyline one comes upon the menil almost by accident the long prim looking gray rectangular box with its horizontal cypress siding white steel frame and "ruffled" wrap around portico sits far back from the sidewalk on an unmanicured well trodden lawn with huge live oaks and an occasional sculpture the museum takes up one block of a acre arts related neighborhood compound owned by the menil foundation a short walk away is the rothko chapel with barnett newmans "broken obelisk" in front across the street is the later built piano designed cy twombly gallery beyond that richmond halls dan flavin installation visiting houston for the menils th anniversary celebration held two months early in april mr piano recalled the early first steps of his collaboration with mrs de menil "one of the first things dominique said to me was renzo i dont like beaubourg what she wanted was a building that looked small on the outside but was big on the inside " "big on the inside" meant a space conducive to the private contemplative spiritual experience of art that mrs de menil cherished too many masterpieces vying for attention induced what she called "museum fatigue " the solution the two concluded was to rotate the menils collection exhibiting perhaps of it at one time hung generously spaced and at eye level while the remainder "rested" upstairs in accessible storage works would wait in the wings for their next call back a chance to be hung with a fresh curatorial idea a new juxtaposition with other works and always the possibility of deeper understanding mrs de menil wanted her art to be experienced under the changing conditions and moods of natural light as it fluctuated with the seasons the movement of the clouds and the sun mr pianos solution was an overhead system in most of the nine galleries of ferro cement louvres or leaves which bounce reflect and filter light into the gallery taking a page from mrs de menils residence the african and oceanic art galleries also have enclosed gardens whose natural light adds a brilliant mise en scene realism to the setting one enters the menil through a tall spacious foyer with floor to ceiling windows the space is unfurnished save for a huge brown suede ottoman in the middle of the room and a small desk off to the side the loudest sound is the clack of footsteps on the floors of ebonized pine a soft wood chosen for the stories its wear patterns would tell there one might find oneself in the middle of a dialogue between three works of art triangulated on three walls or be struck by the presence of say a rare billboard sized painting by walter de maria "the color men choose when they attack the earth" a rothko canvas hanging in the foyer during a recent "klee in america" exhibit was a subtle curatorial nod to the mutual admiration between those two artists to walk the nine galleries grouped by period but arranged nonchronologically emanating from a single long hallway with a huge john chamberlain crushed car sculpture at one end is to re experience the quirky trajectories of the de menils art sensibilities as influenced over the years by four pivotal art dealers scholars and curators including the menils founding director the late walter hopps the couples early forays into modern art led to an appreciation of the links it shared with the art of ancient and indigenous cultures thus galleries move from cycladic and other ancient figures to egyptian mummy masks pre columbian art byzantine icons and golden medieval reliquaries and onto the creations of african oceanic and northwest coast peoples then finally the large modern and contemporary galleries with their deep holdings of living giants jasper johns and robert rauschenberg to name but two works are exhibited without explanatory wall notes identified only by title artist medium and date more information is available in brochures and catalogs "here is one of the few remaining refuges where you can come and have an experience of your own without being told what you have to feel or have to do or what you have to buy " says the nuseums current director josef helfenstein adding that the bookstore and gift shop are in a bungalow across the street visitors come and go freely literally theres no admission charge an absence of post package checking and parking is easy so accessible is the museum that visitors make regular impromptu stops a few therapeutic minutes on the way home from work perhaps or for a second fourth or th look at a single work all exactly as dominique de menil wanted it ms lewis writes about the arts from austin texas see related letter "letters to the editor a magnificent museum renzo pianos design" wsj june
