journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources environment recycling makes sense most of the time it might seem hard to believe but most of the used glass paper metal and plastic that consumers leave curbside actually does get recycled the economist says and by and large it makes sense to do so the sight of recycling trucks picking up recyclables often makes people wonder whether the transportation of waste materials requires more effort than it is worth and ironically doubts have increased as recycling technology has grown more sophisticated with machines able to do the sorting once left to consumers consumers in the u s and western europe have sharply increased their recycling in the past few decades americans today recycle of their municipal trash compared with only in and while recycling costs money and uses energy a recent review of separate analyses showed that recycling is better for the environment of the time some products fare better than others glass and metals can be recycled almost indefinitely and usually with great benefits recycling aluminum requires less energy than manufacturing it plastic has a more complicated afterlife with much of it being recycled for use in other products that eventually find their way to landfills prices of recyclable materials have been rising as the glut of recycled materials has eased though outside of urban areas the costs of collecting and sorting materials often exceeds the revenue from selling the recyclables lately much of the demand for recyclables has come from china waste experts tell the economist that materials are shipped on vessels that otherwise would return empty to asia but sometimes the desire to recycle still far exceeds the demand britain for example is the largest importer of wine but makes almost no wine of its own creating a mountain of used green glass to right the imbalance while protecting the environment a new program organizes imports of wine in gallon containers and then bottles it in britain oenophiles might cringe but it puts those empty bottles to good use the economist june economics how the cost of offshoring has been underestimated offshoring is hurting the u s economy more than official statistics reveal businessweek reports in a cover story the problem the magazine says is that the u s has been relying on misleading monthly import price data that fail to capture the cost savings of offshoring manufacturing that leads government statisticians to underestimate real import growth and hence overstate overall economic growth businessweek conducted a detailed analysis of monthly import price data and found that offshoring to low cost countries has created "phantom" gross domestic product reported gains in gdp that dont correspond to any actual domestic production of about &# billion since that would lower real gdp today by about half of while that isnt a huge slice it is enough to erase as much as of the gains in manufacturing output over the same period "gains from trade are being measured instead of productivity " robert c feenstra an economist at the university of california davis tells the magazine businessweek cautions that its calculations are rough especially because the magazine made assumptions about the size of cost savings from offshoring information that the u s government doesnt collect phantom gdp would help explain why many workers arent benefiting more even as companies become more efficient it also suggests that the transfer of key tasks overseas might have more to do with the robust growth in u s corporate profits than previously thought the u s agency that calculates gdp data concedes that there might be some problems with the current approach "theres something real here but we dont know how much " says j steven landefeld director of the bureau of economic analysis businessweek june medicine an excess of conventions fuel false sense of urgency doctors attend far too many conventions and the constant meetings have brought a false sense of urgency to medical issues that should be dealt with in a more methodical way an infections disease specialist says with the exception of true calamities such as aids says new york physician kent sepkowitz there is rarely enough to talk about at medical conferences especially now that information can be communicated effectively in other ways diseases like tuberculosis and avian flu are frightening but other than aids no infectious diseases present a "grand scale" public health crisis doctors should manage noncrisis infections in a way that "respects the natural pace of science " instead as the meetings stack up hyperventilation takes over replacing "deliberative though often boring medical discourse " slate june see more on our blog at wsj com informedreader send comments to informedreader wsj com
