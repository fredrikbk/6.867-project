running on empty on a road to nowhere an alaskan village asks a scary question what happens when oil is too expensive to use shungnak alaska when genevieve norris was born years ago in this remote eskimo village hunters used dog sleds to pursue caribou and moose wood stoves kept out the cold during the long dark winters then shungnak entered the petroleum age and fuel was barged up the kobuk river every summer noisy electrical generators arrived which allowed lights and indoor plumbing to be installed soon nearly every home had snowmobiles four wheelers and heaters now as crude oil prices have doubled in the past couple of years ms norris and the rest of the village are being priced back out of the petroleum age she heats her home with wood as much as possible and only occasionally buys gasoline for an outboard engine to go fishing "fuel right now im only purchasing if i have to " says ms norris even though shungnak is in energy rich alaska home to the largest u s oilfield discovered in the past half century it is at the very end of the oil distribution system by the time gasoline makes it here from where it is refined it costs &# a gallon more than twice the current u s average the u s has long enjoyed among the lowest oil prices in the industrialized world and until recently even in remote alaska fossil fuel was affordable to the majority of people decades of cheap energy prompted americans to use more and more petroleum lengthening their commutes in the lower states and trading in dog sleds for snowmobiles in alaskan villages today the price of oil and all the products made from it has surged and seem likely to remain high for some time this has raised the unsettling question what happens to a community accustomed to cheap energy when the energy is no longer cheap remote villages like shungnak have long been fragile economies with little to offer residents by way of jobs and opportunity high fuel prices have made a bad situation worse threatening the survival of shungnak as well as more than a hundred other remote villages some of the estimated people living in these villages have left for alaskas large cities creating what one former state elected official has called "energy refugees " these native alaskan villages are among countless poorer communities across the world that have been hammered by the new centurys energy price boom over all strong economies such as china and most of the u s have held up well despite the sting of higher fuel prices but in poor regions the price shock has hit hard thousands of nepalese took to the streets of katmandu last year resulting in bloody clashes with police to protest a rise in gasoline prices in july under pressure from the international monetary fund the yemeni government lifted gasoline subsidies and the resulting riots left people dead the government buckled and restored subsidies in africa guineas decision to reduce gasoline subsidies over the past two years helped spark general strikes and riots that claimed at least lives the village of shungnak was officially founded in but eskimos have lived in the region for thousands of years traveling between summer camps and winter camps today the village is a collection of homes a store a school a community health clinic and a city office building along a half dozen dirt streets the foothills of the brooks range rise in the distance over the tundra petroleum didnt arrive here until the middle of the s as the crow flies shungnak is only miles northwest from the flint hills resources refinery outside of fairbanks alaska but since there are no roads to shungnak the journey is a complex route that stretches more than miles passing mountain meadows where grizzly bears graze caribou herds sipping from glacier fed streams and mile after mile of rugged unpopulated coastline first fuel from the fairbanks refinery is loaded onto rolling tanker cars and taken south through denali national park past mount mckinley and into the port of anchorage then its loaded onto a barge and towed through the unimak pass a navigable break in the aleutian islands before it heads north for kotzebue on the coast from there the fuel is loaded once a year on a shallow draft barge and pushed up the kobuk river during a brief period when the snow melt engorges the river and makes it navigable by the time it gets to shungnak it has traveled a distance equivalent to the drive from new york to las vegas last year one of the barge companies made it up the river and delivered distillate a blend of heating oil and diesel that powers nearly everything from generators to furnaces to the school and electric company the other barge company less experienced in the regions serpentine rivers couldnt make it up to shungnak during the brief window of time that the river thawed fuel had to be flown in from fairbanks on propeller cargo planes raising the cost to &# for a gallon of gasoline and &# for a gallon of heating oil in february heat in the towns only two story building which holds the city offices post office and tribal council office went out for three days because the tank ran out and no one was willing to pay to fill it up again the temperature inside dropped to degrees below zero half of shungnak village is jobless according to the state commerce department data suggest that alaskans living in remote villages like shungnak already receive about of their income from government programs two and half times the average in the u s now the situation is exacerbated because it is difficult to attract economic activity because of the high energy costs village leaders say their only choice is even more government aid "half the village doesnt know how to go out and do a subsistence way of life their lifestyle is living off the store even though you hear them say were natives we can survive " says raymond woods a member of the shungnak tribal government some residents are leaving town ms norriss daughter moved to south dakota and her high school aged son talks about leaving after he graduates those that remain behind are scraping along henry douglas says he eats less meat and fish than he used to like most people here he receives state energy assistance credit at the tribal store he got &# in january to pay for heating oil it lasted him through march afterward he used a wood stove in the main room of the log cabin where he lives with his sister and his nephew his younger brother george douglas says hes fortunate to have a job as a school maintenance worker the paycheck gives him the &# required to fuel up his polaris snowmobile he uses it to hunt caribou and distributes the meat to three households of relatives including his brothers few of his relatives can afford to hunt much anymore because of the high cost of fuel signs of the cost are everywhere in shungnak on a recent visit there were photocopied fliers posted throughout the village with a stark reminder may is the day the alaska village electric cooperative bill collector was scheduled to be in shungnak the co op known as avec has seen past due accounts soar in the past couple of years last year it took out ads in local papers threatening to cut off paying customers if they allow delinquent customers to move in with them researchers at the university of alaska anchorage estimated that one quarter of household income in remote villages last year went to paying utility bills double the percentage in the poorest residents in remote villages spent of their income on utility bills also double the level a few years ago fuel bills are also swallowing the citys budget last november the villages fuel and electrical bill accounted for of total expenditures according to town administrator helen mitchell in response it has cut costs the hours for city workers were cut to six hours from eight hours a day last year the part time patrolman position was eliminated a couple of years ago the result of these crushing bills is that remote villages face a slow decline four schools in the last two years have shut their doors when they fell below students and lost most state funding in shungnak school enrollment is off in the past decade a few miles down the kobuk river the village of ambler has lost of its school aged population despite shrinking enrollment the regional school district has been on a building boom in recent years largely supported by state grants that in turn has only increased its need for fuel the new schools despite better insulation require more petroleum to operate in nearby noatak an square foot school was torn down and replaced with one more than twice as large with a new air circulating system and more lights "we have a very fragile economy in most of these villages already and then you add the jolt of high fuel oil prices its my guess that many of these communities will not find themselves viable if fuel prices stay here " says mike black director of community advocacy at alaskas department of commerce community and economic development the villages he says "are begging borrowing and stealing to get enough fuel " the extreme costs of fuel in rural alaska have led to numerous energy experiments but various efforts to reduce rural alaskas dependence on petroleum based energy have struggled petroleum is easy to store handle and transport says brent sheets head of the federal governments arctic energy office in fairbanks "it is hard to beat diesel fuel " he says a proposal to build a small nuclear power plant for one small town was shelved when a study concluded that the federal security requirements made the project uneconomic solar isnt a good fit for alaska because fuel demand goes up in the winter when the state gets little sunlight the energy department office even looked at turbines designed to harness river energy dodging logs and car sized icebergs but plans never made it past the theoretical stage one alternative energy success stories is in kotzebue the hub community to the west of shungnak on the chukchi sea on the tundra outside of kotzebue where the only sign of life is paw prints from an arctic fox are windmills capable of generating one megawatt of electricity the windmills "are a hedge against rising fuel costs " says brad reeve a minnesotan who came to the town years ago to run the public radio station and now heads up the electric cooperative as the cost of bringing in diesel has grown electricity from the windmills has looked better and better but the windmills have a high upfront cost they sit on special pilings with chemicals that ensure the tundra remains frozen to hold the windmills steady and on a recent morning as a computer in the coops offices showed megawatts of demand the wind wasnt blowing all of the electricity came from distillate burning generators a reminder that kotzebue needs to keep a steady supply of oil in shungnak mr woods the tribal government official says he expects the oil will keep on flowing eskimos are accustomed to adapting to extreme conditions he says but there is little effort being made to teach children how to hunt the old way "their lifestyle now is so convenient " he says hanging out on the steps of the village store after school with friends th grader dion tickett says he didnt grow up learning how to hunt or take care of a team of alaskan huskies he grew up watching television and riding snowmobiles something he and his friends do to pass the time "theres nothing to do around here " he says after school let out on a recent afternoon mr woods spent &# to fill up his arctic cat snowmobile to take his son out hunting but he doesnt expect his son to need these skills in a couple of years when his son enters high school mr woods plans to move his family to east texas where he was stationed in the military gasoline there costs just under &# a gallon
