pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies really special effects as a new ranking emerges a look at what gives flashy images heart we humans used to think of ourselves as the only tool users on the planet thats because we hadnt bothered to notice how many birds primates and other members of earths work force use tools in the course of their daily lives it may be safer to say that were the only list makers no one else compiles to do lists top lists when someone called me at home on tuesday morning to solicit my top comedies of all time i said i gave only at the office or thuddingly earnest lists like the american film institutes greatest american movies of all time which is equally notable for its greatest omissions three chaplins but no keaton two disneys but no pixar and no "cabaret" come on another list that recently entered the lists is the visual effects societys most influential visual effects of all time fifty one actually even allowing for ties someone misnumbered and miscounted the release of the ves list was timed to coincide with this weekends festival of visual effects at the writers guild theater in beverly hills if youre not within parking distance of wilshire boulevard and doheny drive however you can still check out the entries by going to www visualeffectssociety com then clicking on "ves announced " youll find an evocative assortment of films topped predictably by "star wars" with the visionary "blade runner" in the no slot the list honors disneys experiment in computer animation the chilly but trailblazing "tron" contains a few surprises "babe " "darby ogill and the little people" goes back to georges meliess remarkable "a trip to the moon" in and once again omits buster keaton a prodigious technical innovator whose silent comedy "sherlock jr " inspired woody allens lovely "the purple rose of cairo " plus who knows how many other films the list is timely in another way special effects have become the lifeblood of the movie industry or at least the blood that courses through hollywoods main arteries every summer without f x this summers three big s "spider man " "shrek" and "pirates of the caribbean" would be nothing with f x they arent much apart from money minting machines a big apart to be sure but thats an interesting aspect of special effects in this digital age when just about anything that anyone imagines can be put on the screen and will soon be appearing in the next big f x thing d no matter how eye popping and or mind blowing an effect may be its effect on our psyches still depends on its traditional emotional content in "spider man " for instance one of the many the too many villains is sandman a digital creation of extraordinary complexity and no emotional consequence sandman makes a brilliant entrance theres an awesome primeval quality to the scene in which thomas haden churchs flint marko gets caught in an experiment that transforms him into a silicon based shape shifter but were hard put to care about a pile of dust no matter how big or protean the pile may be by contrast alfred molinas doctor octopus the sole but spectacular villain of "spider man " was played with an infectious zest that audiences were glad to be infected by special effects dont have to be big to be special the vast and vastly expensive motion capture process behind "polar express" a film wisely omitted from the ves list largely failed to capture emotions and not just in the case of the glove puppet like faces even the train of the title seemed inert yet the fleeting apparition of an almost incandescent train in steven spielbergs remake of "war of the worlds" is a stunning effect because the train represents escape from fearful danger in atom egoyans "the sweet hereafter " a film set in a town that has lost its children in a bus accident the depiction of the bus plunging from a road into an icy river is technically modest and visually removed the whole thing is seen in extreme long shot yet its anything but remote the moment is in fact shattering because were watching what were watching a school bus with its precious cargo slowly sinking beneath a sheet of ice looking at it another way the more we bring to special effects the more special they become heavy duty digital genius wasnt needed for the moment at the end of john boormans "excalibur" when the sword is flung back in the lake and received by a hand which rising above the waters submerges once again for many of us that image epitomizes the arthurian legend and maybe even evokes "camelot " richard harris richard burton lerner and loewe and jfk similarly the effects in guillermo del toros "pans labyrinth" are by the filmmakers choice almost homespun a few digital creatures and embellishments yes but also puppets painted sets and a monster who quite discernibly is an actor wearing a fantastical costume yet the cumulative effect is intense for all of these excursions from literalism are part of a seamless whole that uses reality as a starting point the end point and the whole point is magic morgensterns picks feasts for the eyes many of the movies on the visual effects societys list were not surprisingly made for kids and a number of those were made in the s a golden age for predigital f x kids today may see the naivete of the three films here but still respond to their joyous conviction the war of the worlds before steven spielberg and tom cruise there was the producer george pal the director byron haskin and gene barry as dr clayton forrester the scientist who happens to be hanging in the hood when alien invaders arrive from mars before all of them of course was orson welles scaring america half to death with his network radio version of the h g wells story this film won an oscar for gordon jenningss special effects the most memorable of which involve the martians swan like machines in flight look for the wires which are marginally visible if you see them pretend you didnt forbidden planet sheer heavens the effects in this sci fi classic give a good name to fakery sure they look like the models and paintings they are and sure robby the robot looks like a donut limbed fat suit with a fat man trying to get out "this is no offense " says an earthman played by an utterly serious pre "airplane " leslie nielsen "but you are a robot arent you " still the overall effect is otherworldly so is the music electronic tonalities the credits say by louis and bebe barron the special effects are credited to a arnold gillespie warren newcombe irving g ries and joshua meador the th voyage of sinbad ray harryhausen the wizard of stop motion model animation was and happily still is a colossus in the world of special effects many of his fans consider this film the highest expression of his art thanks to the process he called dynamation though sometimes superdynamation or dynarama the films setting the island of colossa swarms with extravagant monsters that include a dragon a skeleton a snake woman a giant roc a baby roc and a cannibalistic cyclops mr harryhausen supervised a team headed by george lofgren the director was nathan juran and the music was done by bernard herrmann
