a brief history of economic time modern humans first emerged about years ago for the next years or so nothing happened well not quite nothing there were wars political intrigue the invention of agriculture but none of that stuff had much effect on the quality of peoples lives almost everyone lived on the modern equivalent of &# to &# a year just above the subsistence level true there were always tiny aristocracies who lived far better but numerically they were quite insignificant then just a couple of hundred years ago maybe generations people started getting richer and richer and richer still per capita income at least in the west began to grow at the unprecedented rate of about three quarters of a percent per year a couple of decades later the same thing was happening around the world then it got even better by the th century per capita real incomes that is incomes adjusted for inflation were growing at per year on average and for the past half century theyve been growing at about if youre earning a modest middle class income of &# a year and if you expect your children years from now to occupy that same modest rung on the economic ladder then with a growth rate theyll be earning the inflation adjusted equivalent of &# a year their children another years down the line will earn &# a year against a backdrop like that the temporary ups and downs of the business cycle seem fantastically minor in the s we had a great depression when income levels fell back to where they had been years earlier for a few years people had to live the way their parents had always lived and they found it almost intolerable the underlying expectation that the present is supposed to be better than the past is a new phenomenon in history no th century politician would have asked "are you better off than you were four years ago " because it never would have occurred to anyone that they ought to be better off than they were four years ago rising income is only part of the story one hundred years ago the average american workweek was over hours today its under one hundred years ago of manufacturing workers took vacations today its over one hundred years ago the average housekeeper spent hours a day on laundry cooking cleaning and sewing today its about three hours as far as the quality of the goods we buy try picking up an electronics catalogue from oh say and ask yourself whether theres anything there youd want to buy that was the year my friend ben spent &# for a megapixel digital camera that weighed a pound and a half what about services such as health care would you rather purchase todays health care at todays prices or the health care of say at prices i dont know any informed person who would choose which means that despite all the hype about costs health care now is a better bargain than its ever been before the moral is that increases in measured income even the phenomenal increases of the past two centuries grossly understate the real improvements in our economic condition the average middle class american might have a smaller measured income than the european monarchs of the middle ages but i suspect that tudor king henry viii would have traded half his kingdom for modern plumbing a lifetime supply of antibiotics and access to the internet the source of this wealth the engine of prosperity is technological progress and the engine of technological progress is ideas not just the ideas from engineering laboratories but also ideas like new methods of crop rotation or just in time inventory management you can fly from new york to tokyo partly because someone figured out how to build an airplane and partly because someone figured out how to insure it im writing this on a personal computer instead of an electric typewriter partly because someone said "hey i wonder if we can make computer chips out of silicon " and partly because someone said "hey i wonder if we can finance startups with junk bonds " which contribution is more important by one rough measure the profits earned by the innovator theyre about equal in the late s microsoft earned economic profits of about &# million a year while michael milken the inventor of the junk bond earned an annual income that was just about the same some good ideas even come from economists julian simon came up with the idea of bribing airline passengers to give up their seats on overbooked flights and gone were the days when you relied on the luck of the draw to make it to your daughters wedding economists first suggested creating property rights in african elephants a policy that has given villagers an incentive to harvest at a sustainable rate and drive the poachers away the result villagers have prospered and the elephant population has soared engineers figure out how to harness the power of technology economists figure out how to harness the power of incentives our prosperity relies on both mr landsburgs latest book is "more sex is safer
