sign of the times video email are boons to the deaf internet and texting open a fourth dimension of real time conversation in a short video on youtube jon thompson acts out the comic adventures of a boy getting a motorbike for christmas and taking his first ride he runs over a cat gets his shoelace caught in the wheel and terrifies an elderly couple who are wearing coke bottle glasses he tells the story without speaking a word because his primary language is american sign language or asl mr thompson has been deaf since he was two years old asl is much more expressive than written english said mr thompson in an email interview its "the only way i can express the full thrill of stories " his video "an idiot boy and a motorbike " is a hit dressed in a black t shirt the ponytailed mr thompson stands in front of a blank wall gesticulating at one point he leans back pulls back his hair and creates the appearance of being whipped by the wind the video has been seen more than times on youtube and has elicited dozens of flattering comments like this one "lol my favorite part is superman underwear sooo cute " mr thompson is on the leading edge of a phenomenon that is transforming personal expression among the deaf in recent months there has been a boom in sign language video blogs or vlogs they range from the online diaries of people like chelsea lydell a year old from sacramento calif who vlogs about her faith and personal life to the san diego deaf surfers club which posts sign language interviews on surfing topics a key catalyst widespread campus protests last year at gallaudet university in washington d c a liberal arts school for the deaf students successfully opposed the appointment of a new president jane fernandes using online videos to rally support their concerns centered on the selection process and on her record as provost in an email interview dr fernandes said some students opposed her because she wasnt "deaf enough " partly because she had learned asl only as an adult because of online videos she said viewpoints like these "spread like wildfire " gallaudet ended up choosing another president robert davila and in january he started his own vlog one recent post he interviewed a gallaudet student who captained the winning ice hockey team at the winter deaflympics in an email dr davila said his experience with video so far has been "way beyond anything i envisioned " its "the medium of the future for deaf people " the increasing ease of posting video online as well as growing access to technologies like blackberry and sidekick email devices and cellphone text messaging has "opened the fourth dimension to the deaf time " said bobbie beth scoggins of the national association of the deaf previously she explained it was all but impossible for deaf people to hold a real time conversation with one another unless they were all present in the same room sidekicks are all the rage said ms lydell the california vlogger deaf people will use them "even when theyre sitting next to each other" if they want to have a private conversation "its the deaf version of whispering " she said in an email interview but video holds particular importance to the deaf community because it lets people communicate in american sign language which many consider to be their primary language asl doesnt have a written counterpart and its different from english mr thompson said in his email that asl is "like painting a picture" with your hands growing up deaf in an all hearing family he originally used a different system called signing exact english which involves spelling or signing words in english language syntax "i was having a hard time expressing my sense of humor " he said for reasons like this vlogs are growing in popularity tayler mayer who co founded a web site called deafread com that aggregates deaf related blogs and vlogs says the number of sites that he tracks has jumped from a dozen last summer to about today last month he started a new web site for video only deafvideo tv vlog topics vary from job hunting and education to debates about issues of unique importance to the deaf community such as cochlear implants an electronic device that can help deaf people hear certain sounds some people oppose implants arguing they wrongly imply that deafness is a disability requiring a "cure " rather than accepting that deaf people constitute a unique subculture among the vlogs tracked by deafvideo tv is the one by the san diego deaf surfers club jon lenois savage and three friends formed the club a few years ago to help explain the unwritten rules of surfing to fellow deaf surfers for instance who has the right of way when two people want to ride the same wave the surfer who is closest to the upcoming wave has the right of way "many of us have a passion for surfing but its hard to find someone to surf with who speaks the same language " mr savage said in a phone interview via an interpreter he started posting videos last year hoping to expand the club and now has new surfing buddies many of the most widely viewed videos involve storytelling or comedy "comedic storytelling is when asl truly comes alive " said jared evans a co founder of deafread com for instance theres film maker gary brooks who posts videos of himself dancing in silence while "singing" songs in sign language that he has dreamed up among them is a video he has headlined "worst deaf song " a rough translation i love vlogs vlogs vlogs i want to discuss discuss discuss ow pretends to hurt his finger by signing "discuss" too hard i love vlogs "my hope is to work in broadway theater or in hollywood " mr brooks said in a telephone interview via an interpreter another unusual clip is "deaf ninja" by austin andrews a year old sign language interpreter the video which was filmed in front of wood paneling giving it a made in the basement look tells the story of a ninja under attack in the video deaf ninja emerges from the mist wearing an old fashioned contraption known as a hearing aid box strapped to his chest suddenly surrounded by a weapon wielding gang he whips off the devices earpieces and uses them as weapons to defeat his foes rather than solely rely on conventional sign language that is signs representing concepts mr andrews incorporates body language to suggest slow motion or a shift in storytelling perspective for instance sometimes mr andrews acts the role of the ninja himself other times he in effect "zooms out" to offer a wide angle view by portraying the ninja jumping and kicking in the palm of his hand "let your fingers do the walking" style mr andrews who isnt deaf has a term for all this "cinematic sign language " inspired by the viewer response to "deaf ninja " he says he has just posted "deaf ninja "
