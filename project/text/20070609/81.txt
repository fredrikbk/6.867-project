your secrets in digital wind are file sharing networks leaking data if you use a peer to peer file sharing network you may be sharing more than just music files you may also be letting loose private financial information over the internet in two new studies eric johnson director of the glassmeyer mcnamee center for digital strategies at dartmouth colleges tuck school of business tracked sensitive financial documents from the largest u s banks as they moved through three popular peer to peer networks gnutella fasttrack and edonkey the documents he found included loan applications bank statements dispute letters wire transfer authorizations credit reporting agency records user id and password lists and tax returns many of the documents included information like social security numbers credit card numbers and signatures information that could be exploited by identity thieves even innocent web searches can turn up sensitive documents a phenomenon mr johnson calls "digital wind " the problem says mr johnson is that the million people using peer to peer networks dont necessarily know to limit what they are making available so even though someone might want to share just his mp collection he might be giving other users access to his "my documents" folder once a file is shared it disseminates quickly says mr johnson either by chance or by intent peer to peer networks many of which sprouted after the demise of the original napster file sharing web site allow users to share music videos software and photos typically users offer up their own files in exchange for access to other peoples files although lawsuits have abounded about the legality of peer to peer file sharing some are now operating legally over the course of seven weeks mr johnson had tiversa inc a company that works with financial institutions and government agencies to prevent inadvertent data breaches track the file sharing networks it found more than a half million searches that somehow incorporated the banks names some searches imply that people are scouring peer to peer networks specifically for financial documents searches for "citibank august statement " for example or "pin bank of america" are "not something youd expect in a music sharing network " mr johnson says but another trend the one mr johnson calls digital wind also poses a threat even legitimate searches can turn up sensitive files for example someone searching for music by rapper pnc might turn up documents from the bank of the same name similarly a search for the song "wells fargo wagon" from the musical "the music man" could lead to someones wells fargo &amp co bank statements "the bad news for a bank is if someone is searching for madonnas performance at the wachovia center the search is going to bring up a lot of things that people have on their hard drives related to wachovia " mr johnson says even if a person searching for concert recordings doesnt open a bank statement that mistakenly turns up she might inadvertently share someone elses bank statement in the future "digital wind isnt harmless because it does turn up sensitive documents " mr johnson says "people download it theyre not sure what it is often when they have it they redisclose it " consumers arent the only ones revealing private information in a public arena although mr johnsons studies discovered that of bank related documents found on the peer to peer networks came from consumers came from banks internal networks and came from companies that do work for the banks many people both consumers and bank employees have no idea they are leaking the documents banks controls dont necessarily account for what programs an outside consultant might have running on his computer even in house bank executives "get squirmy" when tiversa talks to them about the problem says tiversa chief operating officer chris gormley because they sometimes email their files home and they dont know if their teenage children are using music sharing networks "the controls are for an environment with a desktop " he says "today were mobile the workplace is wherever i am "
