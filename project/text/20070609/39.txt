politics &amp economics hope for immigration bill bush renews push to persuade holdouts washington advocates of immigration overhaul still hope to gain senate passage by august if a weakened president bush can win over republicans facing grass roots conservative pressure to kill the bill majority leader harry reid threw a monkey wrench into the bills progress thursday night by abruptly pulling the measure from the senate floor after twice falling short of the votes needed to cut off debate mr bush must now redouble efforts to win over reluctant conservatives like fellow texan sen kay bailey hutchison if he is to regain steam and have any hope of winning passage in the even more perilous house this recovery process begins tuesday when the president is to come to the capitol to meet with senate republicans traveling in europe mr bush began calling key republican players from his plane including sen jon kyl r ariz one of the main republican architects of the compromise and devoted his weekly radio address broadcast from poland to the topic the script strikes a more conciliatory tone than recent stump remarks suggesting his critics on immigration didnt want to do "whats right for america " "people have strong feelings on this issue " mr bush said "i believe we can express our feelings disagree on certain elements and still come together on a solution " like few other issues immigration overhaul touches multiple chords in american society jobs race law and a general hunger for greater security and order in todays post "global" society an added element this year is the democratic congress still sorting out its power relationship with a president who hopes to make the immigration bill part of his legacy mr reids tactics in recent days echoed a similar fight last year in which the nevada democrat also challenged the republican commitment to immigration reform but the senate leaders power is far greater today impatient with conservative demands for more amendments he essentially chose to blow up the process to draw mr bush in and force the president to contend with the split in his own party in his radio address mr bush called on mr reid to quickly bring the bill back to the floor and urged "senators from both parties to support it " but appearing at a speech here friday commerce secretary carlos gutierrez also acknowledged that the setback was a "wake up call" to the fragility of the undertaking the single minded opposition to the bill contrasts with the fact that advocates have yet to achieve emotional unity for the cause of immigration overhaul as sen edward kennedy d mass noted in an interview on may the evening before the compromise bill was unveiled recalling the civil rights debates of the s he said "there was always a sense of emotion and movement you dont get that with this and it makes you uneasy in civil rights bills there was a coming together that sense that feeling has been lacking " by contrast disenchantment from opponents on the left and right seemed to grow in two weeks of floor debate republican sen gordon smith up for re election next year in oregon is sympathetic to much in the bill but opposed efforts to move forward "it is the biggest lose lose issue " he said before thursdays vote "the emotions couldnt be more intense and the solution more illusive because the noise is just so great no one sees an upside any longer theres no constituency for this bill except the national need " months of backroom negotiations were devoted to shaping the compromise measure unveiled just three weeks ago but when the freshly minted bill went straight to the floor even business allies admitted they were unprepared for its complexity as in the past conservative critics focused on provisions to begin to legalize millions of undocumented workers already in the u s but the new bill also upset many democrats by proposing a fundamental restructuring of current immigration rules to give greater weight to education and job skills and make it harder for new immigrant citizens to bring in their extended families and even parents learning from the mistakes that followed an amnesty bill passed in there was a much greater emphasis on enforcement border security would be tightened over the next two years and employers subjected to much tougher verification rules for their employees a new guest worker program while backed by business would also be an adjunct to enforcement since it would reduce the workload on border agents who could then pursue more dangerous criminal elements advocates said "its a smart way to do border enforcement " said homeland security secretary michael chertoff "the only way to deal with a mass movement of people is use all the levers to drive people into a legal as opposed to illegal method of doing things the administration also aimed to make more of an effort to reach out to conservatives during the two weeks of floor debate republican backed amendments shifted the bill further to the right the changes seemed to irk democrats more than they satisfied republicans any successful effort now to move the bill forward would have to address some of the issues senators and the administration were trying to resolve in the last moments before the bills defeat thursday night many republicans for example wanted more to reassure the public the government was serious about enforcing the law and securing borders democrats sought changes to put a greater emphasis on family ties as a determinant of future immigration business groups wanted more leverage under the future merit based system to hire specific immigrants high tech industry representatives spent hours discussing a last minute compromise aimed at addressing their issues with visa and green card limits for highly skilled workers on friday the information technology industry council a washington based lobbying group for the high tech industry and a backer of the compromise sounded a hopeful note after progress was made on the groups issues "the senate is too close to halt this process " said ralph hellmann senior vice president of government relations
