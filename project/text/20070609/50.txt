pursuits secrets of a million mile traveler the rhythms of life in spain a magical meal in tokyo seeing the world is easier than ever but truly experiencing a place requires an unconventional approach our travel correspondent on how to escape the tourist bubble i was in zurich for only one night an obligatory stop to make a plane connection at dinner i talked to a young man sitting at the next table he turned out to be a widely traveled half french canadian and half american indian who had lived in switzerland for the past two years he raved about a little town in the swiss alps called arosa so much so that the next morning i canceled my flight to istanbul and took a train to arosa instead that was years ago and ive since returned seven times arosa is at the end of the line of a narrow gauge railway that offers breathtaking views of snowcapped mountains deep ravines roaring rivers and waterfalls because the town is known for skiing in the summer the tourists are scarce the wildflowers plentiful and the hiking spectacular after many years as a travel writer taking countless flights and clocking more than a million miles in the air ive become convinced that the key to a more rewarding experience is violating the rules at least some of the time when others check into big chain hotels i look for an apartment in the back streets ill choose a quirky guided walk through a place over a crowded tour bus its a paradox of travel these days that many people are traveling more widely than ever before but are spending their time in exotic destinations surrounded by the trappings of home familiar hotel chains and brand name restaurants starbucks now has nearly outlets outside the u s including stores in china and on the greek island of mykonos and if youre traveling to nepal the hyatt regency kathmandu has burgers and fries on its room service menu in one form or another this dilemma has plagued travelers before in francis bacon advised the young british aristocrats who traveled to the continent that they should make local friends and eat local food "let him sequester himself from the company of his countrymen and diet in such places where there is good company of the nation where he travelleth " he wrote but with the huge upsurge in travel in recent years staying in that bubble has become a much easier proposition than in francis bacons day my own solution requires two words be counterintuitive when conventional wisdom tells you to do a consider doing b in practice this might be something as simple as eating food from a street vendor or as heart stopping as going to a country when everyone else is fleeing it counterintuitive thinking inevitably gets me out of the bubble and even though it might provoke some anxiety it usually works out fine over the years for example ive often arrived in a city without a hotel booking only once in paris did i have to spend the night sleeping on a park bench moreover the beautiful warm evening made that night in the park almost fun admittedly im one of the more adventurous travelers after some years circling the globe the past seven based in bangkok as a reporter for the wall street journal and ill be the first to acknowledge that travel to unfamiliar places can be a daunting proposition but even the less adventurous can have a better travel experience by applying some of these key tactics in small measures you can escape the horde of tourists and meet more locals by getting out of major cities and exploring small towns but take it as a side trip rather than make it the focus of your vacation for me the unpleasantries dont come close to matching the joys of acting counterintuitively heres how i do it avoid hotels in spain sevilles old city sits behind medieval walls and the narrow cobblestone streets are lined with whitewashed stucco buildings its romantic and picturesque but some distance from areas where many of the upscale hotels are located instead of booking a room out there i booked an apartment in the old city and ended up with the accommodation of my dreams for &# less than the price of almost any hotel i had two large bright rooms plus a modern bathroom and kitchen with hotel rates soaring apartment owners are increasingly finding it more profitable to hire management firms that will rent their apartments to tourists rather than leasing to a long term tenant for travelers it means a chance to break away from bland breakfast buffets and hotel decor that often looks the same whether youre in moscow manila or miami in seville i knew exactly where i was staying with red tile floors colorful tiles decorating the walls and a wood beamed ceiling it was so redolent of spain that i half expected a group of flamenco dancers to entertain me at night the beauty of living in an apartment is that i felt a part of the city not a tourist i switched to spanish dining hours so i could eat with the locals with lunch at p m and dinner at p m the food of seville centers on tapas many consisting of seafood or varieties of spanish hams crowds mill around helping themselves to some food displayed on the tapas bar counters and ordering other dishes its not clear how much anything costs the chaos makes it doubly rewarding to mingle with the regular patrons because theyll often take pity on bewildered americans and explain the system even suggesting what to eat management firms are springing up to handle these apartment bookings and provide maid service you can easily find listings on the internet pick an agency that has photos of the apartment on its web site and that doesnt commit you to paying for the whole thing in advance in case you end up not liking the place beware of any unconventional requests such as cash rather than a credit card on which you can always do a chargeback if you get cheated last year i was burned by an agency in moscow that demanded a &# deposit via western union then took the money and ran get out of big cities to many travelers prague has become the poor mans paris just as beautiful but much more down to earth so if anything is counterintuitive its the idea of leaving this glorious czech capital and heading out to the unknown countryside i did this last year for the first time and was amazed at what i found the czech republic reminds me so much of tuscany with little medieval towns climbing the slopes of hills that are topped with castles stramberk is a tiny town dating back to the th century the nicest hotel in town a splendid renovation of a medieval building has four rooms so you wont exactly be caught in any crowds boarding tour buses you have a view of the main square looking up at the old houses lining the narrow streets at night everyone descends on the local restaurant pub on the main square to eat delicious food delicious that is if you like pork and veal costing only a couple of dollars and to drink glass after glass of the famous stramberk trubac beer its simply the best beer ive ever tasted dark gold in color with a head the consistency of shaving cream unfiltered and unpasteurized its so fragile that it cant be bottled its drawn directly from the casks in the medieval cellars under the restaurant one of the things that made stramberk such a delight is the fact that there is nothing much to do who wants to spend a vacation doing nothing me for one if its a one or two day break from the usual hectic tourist routine of running around frantically seeing things and doing things i sat in the little cafe in front of my hotel drinking coffee walked around the town and took a hike in the surrounding woods from stramberk to a little island in the mekong called don kone small towns make up some of my fondest travel memories before you go look at other peoples recommendations on travel bulletin board web sites like lonely planets thorn tree forums to avoid small towns that are more dull than magical eat where the locals eat it almost goes without saying that the best food is often outside the five star hotels but it can also mean going beyond the cliche of "authentic" local cuisine a couple of years ago i devoted one of my precious few nights during a trip to tokyo to a french dinner it all started one evening not in tokyo but in saigon where i was having a dinner so wonderful that i congratulated the owner he in turn introduced me to a japanese woman eating alone an agent in tokyo for avant garde artists there are tens of thousands of restaurants in tokyo but she seemed to know all the best ones and she recommended tout seul in english "all alone" why not i thought ive seen young japanese interns assiduously chopping away in kitchens of the greatest restaurants in france learning the tricks of the trade presumably the concept of freshness and simple preparation that defines japanese cooking could work equally well on french food "all alone" indeed the young japanese chef who spent six years working in france did everything himself for a maximum of eight diners sitting at a counter he not only cooked but also served the food bused dishes washed pots and poured the wine the japanese aesthetic took as much precedence as in any restaurant serving japanese food my meal included grilled sea scallops served over a tomato puree and roasted guinea hen with a saute of oyster mushrooms asparagus and broad beans it sounds boring but what if the scallops were the freshest juiciest available and what if the tomato puree came not from a can but from the ripest reddest summer tomatoes and consider the vegetables alongside the guinea hen no seasoning other than salt but everything was flavored by the rich juice of the mushrooms aside from asking people you meet for recommendations i find that hotel concierges respond favorably if asked specifically for a restaurant that serves local food where you wont see a single tourist its a challenge for them so different from the usual queries they face intuition tells us that in countries with low standards of sanitation we should confine our eating to fancy places right well consider my years living in bangkok ive had serious food poisoning twice and both came from meals in five star hotels on the other end of the scale i eat at sidewalk stalls at least a couple of times a week and there has never been a problem unlike many tourist spots local restaurants depend on repeat business take a quirky tour i cant deny the benefits of getting to know a city by taking a tour when you first arrive particularly if you dont have much time but being on a tourist bus is like being in a zoo looking through the bars in various cities ive seen better options including walking tours bicycle tours even a running tour of paris when i took a segway tour of bangkok there were just four of us and startled and amused residents stopped us frequently to talk the more unconventional the tour the better in berlin last month i joined a free hour walking tour sponsored by sandemans new europe a company that has similar free tours in several european cities it was the first time that advice in an airline magazine in this case ryanairs turned out to be valuable the guide gets paid by tips only and the company gets its income hoping youll like the free tour sufficiently to take a paying tour what made the tour such a success was the fact that naida alic our year old guide was so far removed from a typical tour guide a harvard graduate majoring in history she had come to berlin on vacation and fallen in love with the city she laid great emphasis on both the nazi era and the rule of the communists in east germany using monuments like the brandenburg gate the bunker where hitler committed suicide and the standing section of the berlin wall as a backdrop to probe the german psyche she showed us the luxury high rise apartment complex built by the communists near the berlin wall to be visible from the west to demonstrate the prosperous life that they wanted the world to think the east germans were leading for lunch she took us to schlotzskys deli it was only after i left germany that i discovered schlotzskys is a franchise operation based in austin texas you see how easy it is in these days of globalization to get sucked into the tourist bubble go where others arent of all the counterintuitive things ive ever done when i travel this heads the list in a month before the united nations sponsored elections in cambodia the khmer rouge attacked siem reap the town thats the gateway to angkor wat and dozens of other magnificent monuments because they didnt have enough strength to hold the city they torched a few buildings and withdrew the attack caused a mass exodus of frightened tourists a week later i flew to siem reap and checked into the grand hotel dangor which had only one other guest an eccentric british poet for two days i had the privilege of being the only tourist at angkor wat one of the great wonders of the world even if youre skittish about destinations in flux its still worth thinking about going where others wouldnt usually flock even if its simply going somewhere off season take my trip to arosa for instance a town in the swiss alps thats usually full of ski buff tourists in winter but where i like to go in summer when i got off at the arosa station on my first visit i could hardly believe i was in switzerland waiting to board the train for the return trip was a large group of orthodox jews speaking yiddish to each other the men dressed in long black coats and black hats it turns out that while few americans have heard of arosa its a popular getaway for israelis theres a strictly kosher hotel and in the hills above arosa a dairy that sells cheese yogurt and milk owned by an orthodox jewish family ive never done more beautiful hiking than in arosa which is why i keep going back a real bonus lies with the people you meet on the hiking trails many are elderly swiss who have retired to arosa not to watch television but to hike in the summer and ski in the winter theyre in no special hurry and enjoy saying hello some are in their s and although im loath to admit it some have zoomed past me as ive made my way up the steep mountain trails email me at stan sesser wsj com
