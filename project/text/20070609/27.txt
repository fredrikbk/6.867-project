picking an account that fits brokers introduce umas as full service choice for the just wealthy the alphabet soup of money management products has a new entrant the "uma " brokerages and money managers are starting to roll out unified managed accounts the latest iteration of the fancy full service accounts usually reserved for the very rich that are now moving down to the merely rich umas are aimed at clients with roughly &# to &# million to invest it is part of an effort by wall street firms to boost the revenue derived from fees that are based on how much money clients keep in their accounts these fees tend to be more profitable for firms than simply charging commissions on individual trades complicating matters a recent court decision sharply curtailed brokers from offering fee based accounts like these if they arent registered investment advisers that ruling is causing turmoil among brokerage firms as they adjust to the court ruling and steer existing clients into various new accounts such as umas the uma joins the pantheon of more established programs including separately managed accounts or smas which are accounts run on an investors behalf by individual money managers say someone with a specialty in bonds or international stocks decent diversification in a collection of smas usually requires &# million or more in investments at the other end of the spectrum are mutual fund "wrap" accounts which are portfolios of mutual funds wrap accounts have minimums as low as &# but are much less customized umas offer more careful management of tax issues and have higher minimum investments than wrap accounts this spring industry giant merrill lynch &amp co joined the fray with its own unified managed account bank of america corp entered the uma field last fall and morgan stanley and citigroup inc s smith barney both of which started offering early versions of umas a few years ago are planning to sharply expand their products investment options umas can combine multiple types of investments including mutual funds and exchange traded funds and individual smas in a single account an "overlay manager " sometimes a person but more often software set up to handle parts of the job coordinates the buying and selling of securities across those investments with the aim of minimizing taxes and keeping the asset allocation in line with the investors goals investors get just one account statement and one form for the irs that convenience has a price uma fees ranging from about to of assets are roughly on par with the more upscale separately managed accounts but if you have less than &# or so to invest you will likely end up in a prepackaged portfolio chosen by the investment firm as opposed to a portfolio where allocations can be tweaked also investors usually cant include trendy but harder to trade investments such as hedge funds "we dont use umas and we probably never will " says j t scully a director at convergent wealth advisors a wealth management firm owned by city national corp in beverly hills calif he says his firm already has a team of advisers who provide many of the same services still umas are expected to attract more assets in coming months as many brokerage firms phase out their fee based brokerage accounts and instead urge clients to shift into umas assets in umas rose to &# billion at the end of the first quarter from &# billion a year earlier according to cerulli associates inc that is still just a sliver of the &# trillion that currently sits in all managed accounts ultimately the decision to move to a uma will boil down to the type of relationship you want with an adviser for investors who like getting stock tips but prefer to maintain control over the actual investments a brokerage account may make more sense a managed account might be more appropriate for an investor who prefers to hand over the financial reins to someone else dan roundtree a financial adviser with lincoln national corp s sagemark consulting in westlake village calif says he has moved some of his clients to umas offered by brinker capital inc to get better diversification at lower minimums the uma also took over some of mr roundtrees previous responsibilities of rebalancing clients assets each week "it frees up my time to spend with clients on things that are important to them such as whether they should take a new job " he says here is how umas work an investor typically sits down with an adviser to discuss financial assets risk tolerance and investment goals the advisers firm then recommends an appropriate portfolio if the account is big enough it can include some separately managed accounts that are chosen based on a money managers investment style such as large cap growth stocks or emerging markets to diversify the portfolio some assets might be invested in mutual funds etfs or other instruments in some cases the adviser may be able to tweak the asset allocation or use different managers the more money you have to invest the greater the customization most investment companies include money managers from outside firms for merrills uma program for example the company added outside managers to its roster for a total of including such boutique firms as cohen &amp steers and wellington management co advisers can also change individual managers in the portfolios some firms such as smith barney and bank of america outsource the overlay management services to specialists others such as morgan stanley choose to handle most of the overlay functions in house it can be tough to compare different firms uma programs a good place to start is with the menu of investment choices ask the firms about their process for putting together the portfolios including how they select the managers and how they monitor the portfolios and managers performance investors should also look for a range of different types of investments and if the program covers a variety of sectors and strategies if the firm offers proprietary funds they should make up only a small part of the choices merrill is launching its uma with separately managed accounts only but will add mutual funds and etfs in the third quarter of this year another firm lockwood investment strategies owned by bank of new york co includes real estate investment trusts and mutual funds that mimic hedge fund strategies in its uma program along with separately managed accounts and traditional funds lockwood expects to add leveraged etf options and annuity type products later this year
