pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings handicapping the tonys wholl win and who cares new york you can count on one thing about this years tony awards the ratings will be lousy they always are theater is an important part of american culture but it isnt an important part of the life of the average american tv viewer and even the highbrows who usually tune in the tonys are more likely to be watching the last episode of "the sopranos" sunday night for those who care about theater the news is in the nominations and more specifically in four categories best play best revival of a play best musical and best revival of a musical of the shows that opened on broadway during the season have been nominated in these categories which ones will win and which if any should win it is in the answers to these questions that the tonys offer a crystal clear snapshot of the sickly state of broadway the shows i expect to win are in italics best play "the coast of utopia " "frost nixon " "the little dog laughed " "radio golf " the surprising box office success of tom stoppards long demanding trilogy of plays about the origins of marxism would seem at first glance to bode well for broadways artistic health but "the coast of utopia" was produced by lincoln center theater a nonprofit company far from the theater district whose status as a "broadway house" is purely technical new plays are rarely to be found on broadway anymore "frost nixon" is a british import and "the little dog laughed" an off broadway transfer that flopped while "radio golf " august wilsons last play made the rounds of regional theaters for two years before finally coming to new york nor are any of the latter three plays good enough to deserve a tony though "frost nixon" is vastly entertaining in its shallow way except for "the coast of utopia " only one new play of real literary distinction david hares "the vertical hour " opened on broadway last season best revival of a play "inherit the wind " "journeys end " "talk radio " "translations " r c sherriffs hopelessly dated play about the horrors of world war i never found an audience and closes tomorrow but its likely to win anyway propelled to victory by voters who see it as a statement against the war in iraq "inherit the wind" is a bad revival of a bad play "talk radio" a good revival of a fair play the manhattan theatre clubs production of brian friels "translations " by contrast was a matchless revival of a great play but it originated out of town at princetons mccarter theater center meaning that broadway gets no credit for its excellence best musical "curtains " "grey gardens " "mary poppins " "spring awakening " "spring awakening" cant lose its a rock n roll musical about teen angst thats full of four letter words and simulated sex unfortunately it also has an unmemorable score so do "curtains" and "grey gardens " so did "legally blonde the musical" which was passed over by tony nominators who found it totally lowbrow so did every other new musical that opened on broadway this past season thats not a fluke its a trend and a scary one the only "new" broadway musical of the season with a strong score is "lovemusik " and its songs were written by kurt weill who died in the new songs added to the stage version of "mary poppins" arent bad but much of the score is similarly recycled from the movie of the broadway musicals ive reviewed since becoming the journals drama critic four years ago the only ones with new scores that were truly distinguished were "the light in the piazza" and "the th annual putnam county spelling bee " best revival of a musical "the apple tree " "a chorus line " "company " " in the shade " this ones anybodys guess me id give the prize to john doyles revelatory production of stephen sondheims "company " but it wasnt quite so well received as mr doyles revival of mr sondheims "sweeney todd " so my guess is that " in the shade " which got adequate notices i loved it and brought the incomparable audra mcdonald back to broadway will get the nod instead note however that two of these shows " in the shade" and "the apple tree " were small scale limited run productions by the nonprofit roundabout theatre company while "company" came to new york from cincinnati playhouse in the park yet another sign of creative trouble on broadway fully half of the shows that opened there this past season were produced by nonprofit new york companies or transferred to broadway from nonprofit regional companies or were imported from london as for the shows nominated for best play and best musical tonys seven have closed or are closing shortly while three others "company " "radio golf" and "talk radio " are struggling at the box office all this suggests that american theater is in the doldrums if you go by the tony awards but when you venture out of the theater district of manhattan as i do most weeks you soon discover that theres far more to american theater than broadway most of the best plays i saw last season were either presented off broadway or by such regional companies as baltimores centerstage bostons american repertory theatre chicago shakespeare theater los angeless geffen playhouse new haven conn s long wharf theater san diegos old globe seattles intiman theatre and washingtons studio theatre thats the new reality of drama in america when broadway is good theres no place better but nowadays there are plenty of other places that are just as good more consistent in artistic quality and infinitely less expensive terry teachouts predicted winners mr
