pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations old jersey real the sopranos" wasnt only a great show or even a classic it was a masterpiece and its end sunday night is an epochal event with it goes an era a time you know the story and if you dont youve absorbed enough along the way as you overheard people chat monday morning around what we still call the water cooler and mean as the line at starbucks a new jersey mobster with a family a business and a therapist makes his way through life it was a family drama that was a mob drama but in some hard to put your finger on way it was the great post drama of our time "the sopranos" first aired on hbo in but rewatching the first season theres an air of preamble to it as if something were coming something was and the show really got its shape and mood from what followed in september sometimes this was subtle tony goes to his old uncles place upstate and suddenly thinks about going to live up there where its safe where the birds fly on the lake sometimes it wasnt in the bar he reads from a newspaper story about how unprotected the port of newark is i remember this because at the time id begun to worry about the port of newark that kind of thing happened a lot with "the sopranos " it was real old jersey real satriales butcher shop not the mall and primal it was about big things as all great drama is the human hunger for for dominance for safety for love the desire to rise in the world the need to belong to something to be a jet or a shark a crip or a blood and have mates homies esteemed colleagues or paisans how we process the hypocrisy all around us in our families and among our friends as we grow up how we process hypocrisy in ourselves because it was primal its dialogue was pared to the bone and entered the language you disrespecting the bing you wanna get whacked and other famous phrases many of them obscene the drama of tony the great post drama of him is that he is trying to hold on in a world he thinks is breaking to pieces he has a sense even though hes only in his s that the best times have passed not only for the italian mob but for everyone for the country that hed missed out on something and that even though he lives in a mansion even though he is rich and comfortable and always has food in the refrigerator and carm can go to paris and the kids go to private school for all of that he fears hes part of some long downhill slide a slide that he cant stop that no one can that no one will out there he told his son and daughter it is the year but in here its his bluster his desperate desire to re create order with the rough tools of his disordered heart and brain are comic poignant ridiculous human tony became a new and instantly recognizable icon and his character adds to american myth to americas understanding of itself its a big thing to create such a character and not only one but a whole family of them uncle junior christopher carmella this is david chases great achievement to have created characters that are instantly recognizable utterly original and that add to americas understanding of itself and to have created too some of the most horrifying moments in all of television history and one that i think is a contender for most horrifying moment ever that would be adriana desperately crawling crawling through the leaves in the woods as she tries to flee her lovable old friend silvio who is about to brutally put her down here is a question that touches on the mystery of creativity and ill probably put it badly because i cant define it better than what im going to say david chase is the famous and justly celebrated creator of "the sopranos " the shaper of its stories the psychological spiritual and emotional energy needed to create a whole world which is what he has done is very great it is a real expenditure a kind of investment in life a giving of yourself you cant do what he does without something like love not sentimentality or softness or sweetness but love and yet in a way if you go by "the sopranos " mr chase loves nothing human beings are appetite machines and each day is devoted to meeting and appeasing those appetites no one is good there are no heroes he sees through it all the mental health facility is a shakedown operation where they medicate your child into zombiehood and tell him to watch tv politicians are the real whores the fbi is populated by smug careerists in the penultimate show a table full of psychotherapists top each other with erudite seeming comments that show a ruthlessness as great as any gangsters i guess im asking where the energy for creativity comes when you see with such cold eyes not that theyre unrealistic theyre not one of the reasons the show was so popular one of the reasons it resonated is that it captured a widespread feeling that our institutions are failing all of them the church the media the law the government that theres no one to trust that mighty mouse will not save the day in mr chases world everyones a gangster as long as he can find a gang those who dont are free lancers and what he seems to be telling us as the final season ends is that all your pity for tony all your regard for the fact that he too is caught all your sympathy for him as a father as a man trying to be a man as a man whose mother literally tried to have him killed is a mistake because he is a bad man he has passing discomfort but not conscience he has passing sympathies but no compassion when he kills the character who is essentially his son christopher he does it spontaneously coolly and with no passion its all pragmatism hes all appetite tony is a stone cold gangster there have been shows on television that have been simply sublime in drama there was "i claudius " a masterpiece of mood and menace "trust no one " from which writers and producers continue to steal see hbos "rome " and pbss "upstairs downstairs " a few others "the sopranos" is their equal but also their superior it is hard to capture the past but harder to capture the present because everyone knows when you dont get it right it takes guts to do today david chase did and he made a masterpiece ill be watching sunday night but ill wake up that morning with a blue moon in my eyes
