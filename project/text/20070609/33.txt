pursuits books a foreign correspondent and his ancient companion travels with herodotus by ryszard kapuscinski knopf pages &# herodotus works hard on the road he is a reporter an anthropologist an ethnographer a historian and he is at the same time a typical wanderer or as others like him will later be called in medieval europe a pilgrim " ryszard kapuscinski the polish foreign correspondent who died in january at the age of felt a special affinity for the writer whose "histories" are among the glories of the classical age mr kapuscinskis life was also a wandering one filled with anthropological detail he calls herodotuss "histories" written in the fifth century b c "world literatures first great work of reportage " mr kapuscinskis many books are part of the same tradition his last "travels with herodotus " is an episodic memoir of a career spent on the road including his first dizzying reporting trip to india in and the research travel he did for books such as "shah of shahs" on the iranian revolution and the near allegorical "the emperor" about the downfall of ethiopias haile selassie over five decades as a reporter he was nothing more or less he insisted even when he came to be regarded as a "serious writer" mr kapuscinski went to honduras angola ghana kyrgyzstan and other far flung places he witnessed coups many wars and great historical shifts a lot of the time he tells us with herodotus by his side mr kapuscinski knows the book well "travels with herodotus" offers insightful commentary on the "histories" alongside mr kapuscinskis own experiences both men are fascinated by the blinding vanity of politicians the role of chance in history human folly and bravery across its sprawling nine books the "histories" chronicle herodotuss mediterranean travels and most famously the first great clash between east and west in which messy democratic athens repelled the powerful authoritarian persians under the leadership of xerxes the opposition of these forces was one that had a special interest to mr kapuscinski in part as a result of his first hand experience of nazism and stalinism in poland he knew well the danger of despotism of herodotus he writes "there is no anger in him no animus he tries to understand everything find out why someone behaves in one way and not another he does not blame the human being but blames the system it is not the individual who is by nature evil depraved villainous it is the social arrangement in which he happens to live that is evil that is why herodotus is a passionate advocate of freedom and democracy and a foe of despotism authoritarianism and tyranny he believes that only under the former circumstances does man have a chance to act with dignity to be himself to be human look herodotus seems to be saying a small handful of greeks felt free and for that freedom were willing to sacrifice everything " thus in one tightly constructed paragraph mr kapuscinski counters the fashionable idea part of the "clash of civilizations" thesis that some people are culturally ill disposed to enjoy freedom or to break with tyranny he also affirms the universal appeal of the open society and its astonishing to some resilience but mr kapuscinski is not often didactic and never triumphalist his luminous narratives are filled with odd juxtapositions and the ambiguities of real experience here he is in khartoum sudan in at a louis armstrong concert "the evening was hot and airless and when armstrong walked out attired moreover in a jacket and bow tie he was already soaked with perspiration he sang hello dolly this is louis dolly he sang what a wonderful world and moon river he sang i touch your lips and all at once the sparks go flying those devil lips but the spectators continued to sit silently there was no applause did they not understand the words was there too much openly expressed eroticism in all this for muslim tastes after each number and even during the playing and singing armstrong wiped his face with a large white handkerchief these handkerchiefs were constantly changed for him by a man whose sole purpose in accompanying armstrong around africa seemed to have been this i saw later that he had an entire bag of them dozens and dozens probably " mr kapuscinskis success brought him detractors pedantic scolds questioned his sourcing and style claiming that his reporting included invention and heightened effect a kind of "magical journalism " a different charge was leveled last month in poland leaked secret police files purport to show that mr kapuscinski "collaborated" with the communist regime in by filing short reports from abroad in exchange for the right to travel as an employee of the state news agency a passport wasnt easily secured and like many east europeans mr kapuscinski dreamed of "crossing the border " not many who know the poland of those days will be surprised and this posthumous allegation doesnt diminish his work "travels with herodotus" is an atypical kapuscinski book less reliant on his own reporting and yet though couched as a tribute to herodotus more personally revealing his mission he offers was to convey the experience of seeing different places meeting new people and living through interesting times this approach is inherently subjective but all the more forceful for it like herodotus ryszard kapuscinski was a reporter a historian an adventurer and truly an artist mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
