serino coynes ceo helped modernize theater campaigns questions for nancy coyne company omnicom groups serino coyne inc new york titles chief executive serino coyne inc is the largest theatrical advertising agency in the u s representing of the musicals on broadway including "jersey boys " "mary poppins " "monty pythons spamalot " "wicked " "mamma mia " and "the phantom of the opera " since co founding the agency years ago nancy coyne has helped expand and modernize theatrical advertising using different media and approaches the agency was acquired by omnicom group inc in ms coyne years old helped usher in such changes as using television commercials to promote shows before they open with "evita" in and was among the first to use market research to delve into the minds and habits of theater audiences she helped bring about "tuesdays at " under which some broadway shows to lure suburbanites start their tuesday performances at p m instead of p m as well as a discount program that helps attract audiences in months when fewer tourists visit new york before the age of the megamusicals such as "phantom " a hit show would run for a few years these days a hit can run for a decade or longer ms coyne says advertising and branding are a big part of the reason broadway had a record breaking year in with ticket sales of &# million and attendance by more than million people the next few months leading up to the tony awards in june are among the most important for broadway with almost new productions vying for the attention of theatergoers and tony voters ms coyne talks below about the evolution of theatrical advertising the nature of theatergoing and the continuing lure of live performances in the internet age the wall street journal how far before a show opens do you begin planning an ad campaign ms coyne way ahead sometimes before the script is finished or the songs are written were given a rough draft a timeline maybe as much as a year ahead we started working on "curtains" last spring for an august engagement in california and a year ahead of the broadway opening next month an out of town tryout is to me crucial to the development of a strong marketing campaign its not only whats on the stage you have to assess what people are talking about if you read the script for "grey gardens " you might sell it one way if you see it with its star christine ebersole you sell it another way you never know where the star turn is coming from for "evita " i was sent to california to see the shows tryout in los angeles and san francisco before it came to new york patti lupone was making her broadway debut in that show in los angeles she was kind of shaky and i went back to change the storyboard so mandy patinkin was featured as equally as patti lupone in fact he was eating up the stage but by the time i got to san francisco she was gaining on him though people were still talking about mandy i shot a commercial with a lot of patti and a good chunk of mandy in it i shot enough so that i could have slanted it to many points of view or actors then its opening night on broadway and patti tears the house apart mandy patinkin was still featured prominently in ads but it was clearly pattis show and the advertising reflected that wsj what are the reasons your company would turn down doing an ad campaign for a theatrical production ms coyne i have only really one reason i dont believe theres enough money in the budget to do the job correctly its like asking me to paint a room with a pint of paint and im going to need five gallons all youre going to get is a thin coat that wont do the job wsj given the modest ad money available for a show about of a musicals weekly gross how do you maximize the bang for the buck ms coyne we target our audience very narrowly we approach the people who see multiple shows a year we know where they live we send direct mail that solicits them in advance of a show opening in focus groups we have found that in every office every neighborhood theres a person who sees everything whos the source that person usually a she is much more important and effective than a critic advertising is so expensive that if we relied on advertising to make every sale wed be in trouble wsj is there any form of advertising you wish you could use but cant afford ms coyne i cant say there is one of the interesting things about advertising particularly theatrical advertising is that we have a limited budget but with that we can spread it out over many different media theres tv radio an online campaign newspaper campaign magazines wsj does broadway need to change to remain relevant in the on demand entertainment age ms coyne i dont think broadway is broken as electronic media proliferate as you can watch movies on your cellphone and as children are being raised on instant gratification with broadway its still different youve got to show up at p m and the show doesnt stop until its over at for that period of time its all happening on our time schedule not yours in a way as this form of entertainment has become less the norm the experience is more valuable after the theater business bounced back more quickly than other businesses in a survey i asked theatergoers why they said it felt like the right thing to do what they were talking about is the act of sitting in the dark with other new yorkers collectively imagining the cardboard background was a real landscape it was powerful in a spiritual way wsj what are the issues involved in using tv and radio to advertise theater ms coyne we only buy spot ads in local markets radio is very effective most of the people who come into the theater to see a show drive into manhattan heres my ideal scenario a man wakes up turns on "today " sees a commercial gets into the car and hears a radio commercial opens up the paper at work and sees an ad for a show then he goes online to find out some more and sees an ad and on the way home he goes by a billboard and hears a radio spot wsj many big advertisers are putting more of their ad spending into new media such as the web should broadway producers follow suit ms coyne if a show is going to spend a couple of million dollars a year on advertising theyll spend a couple of hundred thousand on the internet its still less than any other piece of the pie the pie being outdoor broadcast newspaper and other then add the internet wsj the prospect of advertisers inserting products into shows has been raised in several press reports is product placement workable on broadway ms coyne i dont think itll ever become anything other than an occasional tie in theater people are very particular about the art of the theater theyre not as likely to have products in shows therefore theyre not as likely to sell product placement you couldnt tell arthur miller to write a line mentioning soap wsj do you know a hit when you see it ms coyne sometimes you can tell a hit at a reading or an out of town tryout but ive been wrong about those too rather than the show itself im usually more interested in the producers and their track record and what sort of team i can assemble to work on it if i could pick a hit id be investing in shows not advertising them
