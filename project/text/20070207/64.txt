in the fray an arab american defends and the real life bauers i am an arab american as well as a fan of " " the two things are not mutually exclusive despite what the council on american islamic relations cair and other such groups have to say about this seasons opening episodes possibly increasing anti muslim and anti arab prejudice in american society most of the terrorists represented in "" through the years have been arab muslims why well probably because most terrorists today are in fact arab muslims as a descendant of syrian muslims i am very well aware that the majority of muslims world wide are peaceful hard working and law abiding that still does not change the fact that the greatest terrorist threat to the u s today comes not from the eta the ira etc but from one group islamic terrorists and this is what makes "" a compelling drama every week instead of pretending islamic terrorists dont exist the show presents frighteningly real worst case scenarios perpetrated by osama bin ladens followers so cair thinks its over the top for the terrorists in "" to blow up los angeles with a nuke please if bin laden and his crew had nukes most of us would be way too dead to argue over such points there is a dangerous trend in the u s today that involves skirting the truth at the risk of offending any individual or group when bill cosby talks to african americans about self respect and responsibility and says publicly what many have been saying privately for years hes branded a "reactionary " "misinformed " "judgmental " and so on when "" confronts americas worst fears about al qaeda whose goal remains to kill as many americans as possible whenever possible the show is said to be guilty of fueling anti muslim and anti arab prejudice well heres the hard cold truth when islamic terrorists stop being a threat to americas survival viewers will lose interest in " " because it will have lost its relevancy until such time i will continue to watch "" because believe it or not the idea that there are jack bauers out there in real life risking their lives to save ours does mean something to me and as for "" causing a possible backlash against muslims and arab americans wheres the evidence of that the show is now in its sixth season and there hasnt been one recorded incident of any viewer ever slurring or attacking any muslim or arab american because of something that happened on the show more to the point in the latest episode president palmer stated "the american muslim community is the greatest line of defense against these terrorists " he advocates strengthening ties with islamic leaders across the u s and is opposed to measures that would in any way infringe upon the constitutional rights of arab americans that said i would certainly welcome more characters in movies tv programs and novels who reflect the overall arab american experience truth is most of us dont have bomb making skills or a desire to become human missiles and there are muslim and arab american ctu heroes out there as well as doctors superdads women scientists etc but just as it took saul bellow to give literary voice to the jewish american experience we need our own storytellers to weave the pastiche of tales that make up arab american life in the meantime the next time a journalist decides to report on arab american concerns about shows like " " maybe he could actually talk to someone other than cair and the muslim public affairs council and seek out arab americans with a different point of view we actually do exist and maybe that same reporter could take a closer look at cair ask cair about the holy land foundation and its support of hamas ask it about the world trade center bombing and the cair board member who was named as an unindicted co conspirator in that case yet still sits on cairs board look a little closer and maybe youll find that cair has good reason to get nervous about shows like " " because terrorists and their supporters continue to hide among us in plain sight we need jack bauer now more than ever mr dabul is a free lance writer and the author of "deadline " a novel about modern terrorism
