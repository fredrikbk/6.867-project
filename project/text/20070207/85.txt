northern exposure tomorrow china sponsored six party talks to disarm north korea are scheduled to resume in beijing this time there are great expectations that an agreement will be reached but if there is a deal it will not be because chinese diplomats worked behind the scenes it will be because the bush administration has made concessions it previously refused to consider in particular releasing frozen north korean funds providing aid and accepting only an interim freeze of the norths production of plutonium american policy makers apparently think that if the u s makes the first moves china will persuade north korea in the future to completely give up its nuclear arsenal china supplies approximately of the norths oil of its consumer goods and of its food it accounts for more than half of pyongyangs foreign trade and is the only nation that pledges to defend kim jong ils state with military force some north korean officials are thought to be more loyal to the chinese leadership than to kim jong il the little autocrat could "neither bark nor bite" without chinas assistance beijing can disarm him but has chosen not to exercise its influence chinas failure to act leads analysts to believe that beijing keeps the kimist regime afloat to preserve regional peace avoid a tide of refugees maintain a buffer against american forces in south korea destabilize japan and obtain leverage over washington beijing seeks these advantages but they barely explain recent chinese policy kim jong il is the destabilizing force in north asia and korean refugees would move south in a crisis and not north a unified korea in beijings orbit would serve as a superior buffer and it is kim jong il who is pushing japan to rearm and build missile defenses and korean issues are beginning to cloud chinas relations with america on balance north korea is a growing liability for beijing as it tars its international standing there are two primary reasons why the chinese havent solved the korean crisis first china is in the middle of a once in a lifetime transition mao zedong was once the worlds arch proliferator of nuclear weapons technologies many in beijing now realize that the further nuclearization of the region will only result in the reduction of chinas relative power it is not just the potential armament of japan south korea and taiwan that concerns the chinese the nuclear agreement between india and the u s the worlds largest democracy and its most powerful one foreshadows a setback of immense proportions for china despite beijings recognition that proliferation no longer benefits china in the long term there is now no accepted strategic vision in the chinese capital just competing views and interests that result in directionless policy what many mistake as "nuanced" diplomacy there may be academics and foreign ministry officials who want to take constructive steps but there are also generals who enjoy bedeviling americans and who maintain close ties with their north korean counterparts the most recent evidence of beijings indecisiveness is its flip on the inspection of goods moving in and out of north korea on oct of last year wang guangya chinas u n ambassador voted in favor of u n security council resolution which calls on nations to inspect such goods immediately after the vote he declared that the inspection provision was unacceptable to china then two days later he said that china would inspect north korean cargoes after all but would not intercept or interdict them this erratic performance is a sign of a government that does not know what to think or do even on matters of importance more generally chinese foreign policy has not evolved to the point where beijing is disposed by itself to openly interfere in the affairs of a neighbor in a drastic manner chinas officials still speak of the five principles of peaceful coexistence all of which boil down to noninterference in others internal affairs as the bedrock of their foreign policy china must complete the process of both shedding the self image of an outsider and ending its traditional role as an adversary of the existing global order such a change inevitably occurs when a rising power matures but it only happens after internal perceptions have shifted over time the fundamental problem is that china is just not quite ready to act like a great power second china has priorities that it perceives to be more important or at least more immediate north korea was pushed to the top of beijings agenda only by an unexpected event pyongyangs october admission to an american envoy that it had been pursuing a uranium weapons program in violation of its existing agreements up until then chinese leaders were preoccupied by domestic matters to the extent they were concerned by international ones they were focused on chinas western and southern borders today other matters such as securing energy are deemed far more urgent than korea china will not disarm north korea on its own beijing has been able to protect pyongyang because seoul is doing the same stripping seoul from beijing should be washingtons most immediate tactical goal if washington can help south korea reverse course certainly possible in light of the conservative trend in that nation the chinese will be alone in their support of pyongyang and will therefore have to take a clear stand they will have to choose between their future cooperation with the u s and their past the alliance with north korea america can help the chinese break the deadlock inside their capital and complete their nations historic transition mr chang is the author of "nuclear showdown north korea takes on the world" random house
