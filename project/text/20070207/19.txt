fronts corrosion and oil spills in alaska a march refinery blast that killed in texas and its energy trading practices with federal officials alleging bp traders manipulated propane markets in bp denies manipulating markets and says it is cooperating with investigators on all three inquiries mr sutherlands higher profile also underscores a trend that goes beyond bp a shift in the boardroom

europes competition czar mr sutherland took over negotiations known as the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva in there he clinched the uruguay round a pivotal trade agreement that set the stage for todays world trade organization to get the accord passed he sometimes kept negotiators at the table late into the night and nailed down agreements on sections of the page document with the bang of a wooden gavel the deal came together after seven years of negotiations and the gavel sits on his desk at his office in london where he serves as chairman of the arm of goldman sachs group inc that oversees europe the middle east and africa "his big secret is combining great charm with great directness " says fellow irishman charlie mccreevy the european union commissioner in charge of

italian prime minister romano prodi more recently he accompanied former goldman ceo henry paulson on trips to china and russia before mr paulson became treasury secretary last year he also helped

sometimes rumpled mr sutherland moves easily in londons clubby business world that contrasts with the more formal public style of the slightly built and immaculately tailored lord browne as chief executive lord browne transformed the company through aggressive deal making supported quietly from the sidelines by mr sutherland and his fellow directors "john browne clearly was the guy running the company and i was there to run the board " he says but private divisions between the two over lord brownes departure plans spilled into the open last year lord browne had long been set to retire in at

between the two and about bps succession the following week lord browne confirmed he would step down as planned at the end of but played down any rift the two had a "good and vigorous give and take" about many bp matters he said in a news conference at the time mr sutherland was annoyed by the july leak but he says he doesnt "bear any grudges " once lord browne confirmed plans to step down in mr sutherland and the board wasted little time finding a successor in december they agreed on tony hayward a top browne lieutenant shortly after board members and lord browne agreed that a two year transition was too long early last month lord browne said he would step down this july in a news conference yesterday lord browne said the company was learning from its missteps last year "bp can and will emerge from this testing period a stronger and better company " he said the media frenzy surrounding the succession planning was unfortunate mr sutherland says still he was always clear that "the
