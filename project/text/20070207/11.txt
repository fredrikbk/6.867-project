said jason evans head of government trading at deutsche bank in new york but a slew of federal reserve speakers including chairman ben bernanke chicago fed president michael moskow and san francisco fed president janet yellen failed to address the u s economic outlook or monetary policy and had little impact on trade that left investors focused on the first leg of the governments quarterly refunding "its really going to be the refunding thats the main theme" this week said mr evans "the big question will be whether the wake of supply in the next two days keeps the market in check that really is the million dollar question " today the government will auction &# billion in year notes and tomorrow &# billion in year issues after weeks of a largely negative tone to treasurys amid upbeat economic news the market yesterday "started to show some technical signs of life " added mr evans "flirting with breaking out of the bear channel that had really confined prices" over the last few months but tony crescenzi chief bond market strategist at miller tabak &amp company said that given "the distortions" present in results for the three year note auction based on the possible
