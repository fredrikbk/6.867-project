new math for plans in budget bill a provision buried in the presidents budget proposals would shelter all college savings plans from being counted in determining federal student financial aid the provision as with nearly everything in the proposed fiscal budget depends on congressional passage and some democratic congressional aides say it is likely to encounter resistance among lawmakers who believe aid gets distributed more fairly when assets are counted the plans which are tax favored investment accounts that help families save for college are subject to a complicated array of assessments when it comes to determining federal aid depending on the type of plan and its ownership the government assesses families eligibility for aid using the free application for federal student aid and funds in most types of plans have traditionally counted in the calculation for determining need a law enacted last year changed how certain "custodial" plans those owned by dependent students rather than their parents are assessed currently they arent counted at all against financial aid whereas previously of the assets counted in the calculation for aid most account owners are parents with students named as beneficiaries as much as of assets in parent owned plans are counted against their aid eligibility the variation in how the plans are counted in the aid process is complicated the resulting confusion administration officials say is one reason they are proposing to change the way s are assessed making it uniform and favorable for all account holders that would be another boon for investors in the plans last year congress made permanent some of the tax benefits that were set to expire at the end of student aid experts say the budget provision may nudge families still on the fence about investing in a plan "this is good public policy because theres still this idea that if you save youre getting penalized " says mark kantrowitz publisher of finaid org a free web site on financial aid "this would make it clear to families that theres absolutely no penalty for saving for a college education " the provision would include both types of plans prepaid plans which are typically operated and guaranteed by state governments let families purchase shares of future tuition bills at current rates savings plans dont offer this guarantee rather they operate much like tax deferred retirement plans do with the stock and bond investments in each account subject to market fluctuations
