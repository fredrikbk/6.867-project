the daily fix celtics sixers grizzlies battle in nbas race to the bottom these are not marvelous days for the boston celtics the team last won a game on jan beating the memphis grizzlies against the grizzlies yeesh since then theyve lost a franchise record straight culminating with last nights loss to the detroit pistons a game that wasnt nearly as close as the final score might suggest and there isnt much reason to think things will turn around soon the celtics play six of their next nine on the road including a tough western swing could the celtics challenge the cleveland cavaliers nba record of straight losses espn coms bill simmons hopes so hes been rooting against the celtics all year despite the fact that theyre one of his favorite teams welcome to the phenomenon of "fantanking " tanking is when teams give up in hopes of landing higher draft picks and this year theres plenty of reason for bad nba teams to tank the june draft will most likely feature kevin durant texas and greg oden ohio state two college players who look like stars in the making fantaking its when fans actively support such abject surrender mr simmons considers whether fantanking is traitorous or ill advised only to be hypnotized by the promise of those picks "then i watch durant flash an endless array of offensive moves or oden put up another double double with one hand and its like monitoring two guaranteed megabucks tickets these guys are mortal locks to be franchise players on the order of lebron or yao either guy would save the celtics " and thats enough for him "if you think about it fantanking isnt actually rooting against your team at all if there is any guilt its that im enjoying this whole thing a little too much " another nba team has attracted plenty of fantaking but not enough tanking "we are at the point in the ers season where everything of significance that can be done has been done " writes david aldridge in the philadelphia inquirer adding that despite the teams disarray "a funny thing has happened on the way to secaucus the sixers have shown a pulse nothing earth shattering mind you but in the last plus enough effort to win a couple more is all anyone has a right to expect at the moment and its the type of play that will inevitably have people lamenting the sixers lack of success in tanking properly in order to improve their potential draft position in the lottery " but mr aldridge isnt a proponent of tanking "i will say this again and again once you start losing its awfully hard to stop " he writes "whatever the reasons bad ownership bad management bad coaches bad players losing in pro sports becomes as hard to shake as warm dog poop off your timberlands there are reasons outside of the economics of their respective sports why your islanders and pirates and royals are who they are its no coincidence that its taken the buccaneers and bengals and saints and clippers and wizards decades to scrape the barnacles of stink off their franchises losing makes free agents leery of coming to your team it makes coaches who can make a difference leery of gambling their won lost records on a flawed product and though no one on park avenue will admit it it makes referees think you fouled lebron when you didnt and let lebron get away with murder against you " in the race to the nba bottom the team to beat is the juggernaut known as the grizzlies who are the owners of a record the celts are and have been actively even ostentatiously shopping their lone star pau gasol in the memphis flyer chris herrington hopes the feb trade deadline passes with mr gasol still in town noting that despite injuries hes put up the best rebound and shot blocking rates of his career while improving his perimeter shooting "whats most encouraging is that these improvements are far more likely to carry over into next season than gasols defensive decline " mr herrington writes adding that "intensity and focus will be easier to come by in a season where the team is playing for more than ping pong balls and the team defense is certain to improve via a combination of personnel changes and solidifying the coaching situation " instead of trading their star mr herrington suggests the grizzlies wait until they know their lottery status since "the prospect of combining gasol with elite center prospect greg oden trumps anything a trade right now can bring " in other words the grizzlies are bad enough to keep losing with mr gasol so they dont need to get worse without him as discussed in yesterdays fix the at&amp t national pro am begins tomorrow at pebble beach with no tiger woods in sight the san francisco chronicles scott ostler ticks off everything thats wrong with the at&amp t woodss absence the pros dislike of the iffy weather bumpy greens and celebrity distractions the relatively low wattage array of celebrities but despite all that he argues the event still casts a spell on golf fans "folks in the middle of our country watch the tournament on tv see the pros and the hollywood celebrities backslapping their way around the worlds greatest golf course tossing one another good naturedly into sand traps with a backdrop of crashing waves and cavorting seals and they snap " he writes "they toss their golf bags and other belongings into their pickups and head west honking goodbye to the boys at cowflop cc fortunately for our nations population distribution most of these dreamers blow a tranny or run out of gas money not far from home but the thought is there " its national high school football signing day when college footballs big schools reveal which of the top high school players theyve signed to letters of intent in the dayton daily news kyle nagel has a question "did you know basketball has a main signing period too its in november you probably overlooked this because almost everyone else does and so i ask why in the world is the college football signing day such a huge deal when the basketball equivalent comes and goes without much attention at all " in the detroit free press drew sharp draws a connection between signing day and the case of o j mayo the west virginia high school hoops phenom who was allowed to escape a mandatory two game suspension for knocking over a ref so he could play in his teams next game which just happened to be at dukes cameron indoor stadium and shown on espn "mayo is awaiting a hearing friday on whether there will be a reprimand " mr sharp writes "how could there not be but the message already is clear to this year old regardless of the ruling he can massage any personal responsibility to his own liking with the so called adults who surround him lighting the path " mr sharp recalls a conversation with a michigan state fan excited about a high school player the school was expected to sign "my response was so what " he writes "all i see is an year old who despite what everyone is probably telling him doesnt know jack about anything dont get me wrong these young men and women richly deserve the college opportunities theyve earned through their athletic skill you hope they will take full advantage of these opportunities but its easy to see how so many of them swell full of themselves due to the circus atmosphere that cultivates a me first superstar mentality one that goes unchecked by those closest to them the best graduation gift they could receive upon leaving high school is having both feet firmly planted on the ground " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
