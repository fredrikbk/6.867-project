the class action market litigation is booming in the u s courts complain of burgeoning dockets lawyers collect record fees legislators regulators and academics either grouse that litigation is driving business offshore and should be contained or that economic injustice still pervades our economy and that the courthouse doors must be kept wide open to help right wrongs but few policy makers or scholars seem aware that a highly controversial component of the litigation market the class action securities fraud litigation business is shrinking faster than a polar icecap the interesting question is why this decline has occurred and what it means for the future of u s securities regulation the modern history of securities fraud litigation begins with the private securities litigation reform act of that law tightened the requirements for filing securities claims and was expected to reduce litigation activity but it had no such effect according to data collected by stanford law school and cornerstone research the number of companies sued in plain vanilla class action fraud claims has averaged about per year from through not much different from pre reform levels but halfway through filing activity took a sharp drop and in only companies were named as defendants in securities fraud class actions a closer look at the data suggests that the decline is even more remarkable because of these lawsuits allege options backdating activity backdating is a one time event and if we subtract these cases we arrive at a "core" litigation rate of companies per year the decline is even more dramatic if we measure the dollar amounts at stake the most inflated measure of the amount at issue in these lawsuits looks at the total decline in a companys stock market capitalization over the period of the alleged fraud typically only a fraction of this decline is caused by the fraud and plaintiffs recover a very small percentage of this loss if anything at all after averaging &# billion from through and peaking at &# trillion in the maximum dollar loss in declined to &# billion excluding the backdating cases reduces the figure to only &# billion why have these declines occurred some claim that the criminal prosecution of the milberg weiss firm long the dominant plaintiff firm in the field caused a cutback in filing activity however there is no shortage of plaintiff class action lawyers in america and the barriers to entry in class action securities fraud are quite low the lawyers who abandoned milberg in droves havent forgotten how to file class action complaints and their incentives to sue every firm in sight remain as strong as ever the milberg explanation doesnt hold much water last years strong equity markets combined with low market volatility offer a second explanation although it will take several years of additional data to determine statistically whether reduced volatility has throttled the class action market i am skeptical because the change in the litigation market is rather sudden in comparison to a relatively smooth shift in the larger stock market patterns to be sure the remarkable boom bust cycle of the late s created a happy hunting ground for plaintiff lawyers the resolution of boom era claims without another boom bust cycle following quickly on its heels would naturally depress the volume and size of class action fraud filings nonetheless current activity levels are low even when measured by pre boom standards the remaining explanation is more interesting and profound perhaps fewer companies are being sued for fraud because there is less fraud under this theory the governments aggressive criminal and civil enforcement strategy following the enron and worldcom frauds has caused corporate boards and management to "get religion" when it comes to complying with the securities laws executives are acutely aware that a major accounting or disclosure fraud is more likely than ever to leave them fired or indicted they respond to this new regime like rational economic actors if you increase the penalties for engaging in fraud then you reduce the incentive to commit fraud nothing complicated here at all in this new world private securities fraud claims generate no meaningful deterrence because its the fear of the feds thats driving boardroom and executive behavior a large body of academic literature also confirms that these lawsuits are virtually useless as means of compensating investors for their losses sarbanes oxley also now gives the sec authority to collect funds that can be distributed to shareholders harmed by fraud when plaintiffs attorneys recover funds for the class they collect contingent fees that can consume up to a third of any recovery but the sec doesnt take a nickel of the recoveries it collects on behalf of investors so if we want to keep the litigation engine running in order to reimburse investors investors could come out ahead if they simply allowed the sec to control the process and eliminated the private bars cut of the action from this perspective class action securities litigation is in decline because there is a new tougher and superior enforcement mechanism in place the sec and the department of justice now insist that any corporation suspected of a sufficiently serious fraud conduct an internal investigation that will finger the executives responsible the corporation must also cooperate in prosecuting these executives this enforcement technique is stunningly effective if often overbearing it eliminates the governments need to conduct expensive and lengthy investigations and provides the authorities with extraordinary leverage over every executive suspected of wrongdoing private litigation doesnt have an equivalent deterrent effect because it cant threaten executives with jail and because damages are almost always paid by corporations and insurers not the executives who cause the fraud as long as the governments enforcement activities remain sufficiently vigorous the private class action securities fraud lawsuit can be viewed as an expensive wasteful and unnecessary sideshow that generates little deterrence and offers questionable levels of compensation the question then is not why these lawsuits have been shrinking so rapidly in recent months but when and whether they should exist at all mr grundfest is a
