swiss seed maker risks losing brazil land spat swiss multinational seed and crop science corporation syngenta ag is in the cross hairs of an antitransgenic seed dispute it might not win in brazil on nov syngenta had one of its genetically modified crop research facilities shut down and expropriated by the parana state government in southern brazil no financial figure has been given but some estimate losses in the millions of dollars for syngenta the acre property was located roughly miles from the iguacu national park in western parana state the park is also home to the immense iguacu falls on the brazil argentine border and is considered a world historic landmark by the united nations roberto requiao paranas governor and a foe of transgenic seed since he was elected five years ago signed a decree to confiscate the property in november on the grounds that it broke federal environmental laws those laws said genetically modified crops couldnt be planted within kilometers about six miles of a nature reserve syngenta argues it was given permission by the biosafety agency of the federal government ctnbio to test transgenic corn and soy on the site syngenta has owned the property since and in november managed to get a federal court to agree the company had been operating legally in the area moreover in early brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva changed the kilometer law the distance between genetically modified crops and nature reserves has been shrunk to just meters the parana government the brazilian environmental protection agency known as ibama agrarian overhaul activists and their lawyers say the meter ruling doesnt count for syngenta because they were experimenting with the seeds before the presidential decree was signed so far theirs is the dominant view "syngenta has been notified time and time again that they cannot plant test or do anything with gmo on that site and they have arrogantly ignored the state " said roberto requiaos spokesman benedito pires "they cannot plant there ctnbio does not interpret the law we are following the law syngenta has been fined for breaking that law and to this day they have not paid it " he said according to andrea vulcanes the manager of ibama parana the agency fined syngenta one million brazilian reals &# in march the company has contested the fined "we fined them because they cannot be testing gmos near that park " ms vulcanes said "we know what ctnbio and others have said and we are considering it but whether we retract our fine or not that doesnt mean syngenta can get its property back from the state thats a whole other matter " she said syngenta sells more than &# billion in seeds and agrochemicals each year under the callisto garst and dual gold brands to name a few only monsanto co and dupont co sell more last week syngenta asked a parana court to review the governors decision to expropriate the land located in santa tereza do oeste it marks the second time syngenta asked a court to get involved in the dispute with the state parana is one of brazils top two agricultural producers syngentas problems began in march when more than rural workers and unemployed peasants which make up part of the via campesina agrarian overhaul movement invaded the site they argued that the company had no rights to plant genetically modified crops in the area the protesters remained on the property for months before police finally kicked them out once mr requiao said he was interested in turning the site into a center for the study of environmentally friendly agriculture via campesina invaded again arguing they had to harvest the corn they planted to eat during their time there parana is already the home to an agro ecology center it is run by some members of the landless rural workers movement or the mst long considered an archrival of middle class and elite farmers and land owners mr requiaos antitransgenic policies have been the result of pressure groups like the mst and others "the anti gmo movement is very different here than it is in argentina or the u s there are social movements of small farmers who are very much against transgenics and they will continue pressuring the governments here " said darci frigo a lawyer for the group terra de direitos in parana the group specializes in labor rights mr frigo was the lawyer who alerted ibama to the syngenta property being inside the transgenic seeds buffer zone set by the government small producers argue that genetically modified seeds cross pollinate with other local varieties harming biodiversity it also makes it harder for farmers to sell once their crops have been contaminated because if it is discovered that their plants have genetically modified traits from monsanto currently the only transgenic brand allowed for sale here those farmers will have to pay royalty payments for the seeds monsanto has genetically modified soy and cotton in the brazil market and partners with a handful of companies to make varieties of those seeds mr requiao has fought parana transgenics and won small victories in the past he banned transgenic crop exports from the massive paranagua port for some four years but in by the order of a federal judge the port was required to permit genetically modified soybean exports once again syngenta is hoping a similar ruling will fall in favor of the company in the near future and they can move back in to santa tereza do oeste brazil is the worlds no soy producer behind the u s
