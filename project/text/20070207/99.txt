politics &amp economics fed chief warns of widening inequality bernanke urges steps that avoid harm to economy washington federal reserve chairman ben bernanke cautioned that widening economic inequality may make americans "less willing to accept the dynamism so essential to economic progress " but he warned politicians to avoid responses that would make labor markets less flexible or create barriers to international trade and investment in an unusual speech for a central banker mr bernanke said a wiser approach to the problem would be to improve education and training and to cushion dislocations caused by technology and globalization he cited such steps as making health and pension benefits more portable and offering retraining and job search assistance to displaced workers mr bernankes comments at the greater omaha chamber of commerce add to a chorus of concern about widening economic inequality from top government officials including president bush treasury secretary henry paulson and mr bernankes predecessor alan greenspan as well as prominent democrats wandering beyond the boundaries of monetary policy his area of responsibility mr bernanke said "although average economic well being has increased considerably over time the degree of inequality in economic outcomes has increased as well for at least three decades " a text of his speech was released by the fed in washington in his page lecture complete with academic references mr bernanke documented the inequality evident in data on wages household incomes and even baseball players contracts he also examined economic forces behind the trend from changes in technology that have increased employers appetite for more educated workers to the decline of unions to the surge in chief executives salaries to the impact of globalization he said the effect of the latter has been "moderate and almost surely less important than the effects of technological change " the fed chairman noted that in professions ranging from entertainment to investment banking the forces of globalization and technological innovation have increased the value of the most talented individuals the "superstars" over the merely good "two decades ago the highest paid player for the boston red sox and in the american league jim rice earned in inflation adjusted terms just over &# million in the highest paid player on the red sox and in all of major league baseball was manny ramirez who received &# million for the season " "the number of fans who can fit into fenway park has not increased much presumably the red sox owners believed that ramirezs highest salary was justified by the increases in broadcast and merchandising revenues he might generate as a result of the confluence of new distribution channels such as internet based broadcasts of games and a larger and wealthier potential global audience " he added mr bernanke spoke explicitly about the degree and causes of inequality and more carefully about the increasingly loud political debate over what if anything to do about it "firm conclusions about the extent to which policy should attempt to offset inequality are properly left to the political process " he said but he offered three principles that he said are "broadly accepted in our society" economic opportunity should be as widely distributed and equal as possible economic outcomes neednt be equal but should be linked to a persons contributions and people should get some insurance against very painful outcomes "we believe " he said referring to americans generally "that no one should be allowed to slip too far down the economic ladder especially for reasons beyond his or her control " mr bernanke who served briefly as an economic adviser to mr bush before becoming fed chief a year ago avoided any mention of tax policy a favorite tool of democrats interested in reducing the inequality produced by market forces he noted that eliminating inequality altogether would be unwise "our market based economy which encourages productive activity primarily through the promise of financial reward would function less effectively " he argued the dynamism that has propelled the u s economy for decades brings with it "painful dislocations" for some workers he added but he said "if we did not place some limits on the downside risks to individuals the public at large might become less willing to accept the dynamism that is so essential to economic progress " when mr greenspan was fed chairman he occasionally expressed concern about the widening gap between winners and losers in the american economy though usually in response to questions from members of congress rather than in public speeches at the joint economic committee in june for instance mr greenspan observed "as ive often said this is not the type of thing which a democratic society a capitalist democratic society can really accept without addressing " mr greenspan generally attributed the disparities to the extra wages that employers pay more educated workers mr bernanke acknowledged that is a major factor but not the only one
