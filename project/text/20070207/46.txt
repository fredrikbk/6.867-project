from bird to person london the "deadly" hn avian flu is back on the front pages of newspapers and tv news shows the british environment minister has pledged quick action to "eradicate" the disease from the u k and over turkeys on one farm have been culled "this is " someone said on the bbcs "breakfast" show monday "a disease of birds not humans " and so it is the hn virus has still not made the critical interspecies leap which would make it easy for an infected person to give the disease to another person that may happen or it may not and nobody can predict the outcome or its timing with any degree of confidence meanwhile as of the world health organizations compilation on feb there had been a total of laboratory confirmed cases of the virus in humans and of that number a staggering or died making it one of the most lethal pathogens in history even if not one of the most infectious still just months ago many experts were predicting a global pandemic in a matter of months perhaps one that would kill millions there is historical precedent the "spanish flu" swept around the world in a matter of weeks and before the disease burned out more than million people had died today hn is reminiscent only of the asian "swine flu " which threatened the u s in but never turned into a serious threat to human life although the media hype surrounding it helped undermine gerald fords presidency in worried people rapidly bought up much of the worlds supply of tamiflu and relenza the only two drugs that seemed to have a chance of beating hn now most of us have forgotten the names of these drugs influenza viruses have eight genes and these mutate rapidly two sites on the viral genome called h and n are well catalogued and each of those genes can come in many forms those are the markers that trigger the human immune system if your body has seen a whiff of a particular virus it will produce large numbers of antibodies if you later become infected with a strain having the same markers if you have never been exposed to a particular strain there are no antibodies in your bloodstream and your body will fight an uphill battle for survival the more virulent the virus the less chance you have so far as is known no hn virus has ever circulated on the planet that means nobody has any natural immunity our good fortune last flu season was that the bird flu virus had not yet learned the trick of passing easily from human to human the few confirmed victims were almost all people whod worked very closely with infected fowl in extremely unsanitary conditions one can suppose that they were massively exposed allowing this "disease of birds not humans" to develop in their bodies almost all influenza viruses originate in migrating water fowl in south east asia and by and large the birds dont get sick however those birds can pass their viruses to domesticated birds in the great viral mixing pot of china where people live in close contact with both their birds and their pigs influenza viruses can readily pass from one species to another and sometimes to an animal or person already infected with another flu bug in this environment mutations are guaranteed to occur and from time to time a new pathogen with the ability to pass between people develops if it carries the same marker combination as one or another previous flu virus much of the worlds population will have a basic immunity if it does not have familiar markers much of humanity is at risk once that virus learns to jump from person to person each year a panel of experts tries to guess which strains of flu will pose the highest risk in the coming influenza season and orders up vaccines to give the vulnerable some protection hn has not been selected because it still hasnt become contagious in our species but it could make the jump at any time the last year has brought the world a major advantage should hn become a "disease of humans " the pharmaceutical industry has learned the difficult trick of making and producing a vaccine against a hitherto unknown disease glaxosmithkline recently claimed that it had succeeded in developing a "second generation" bird flu vaccine that could be given in advance even before knowing the detailed gene structure that would allow this bird flu to infect people the vaccine could be given before the bug even learns that deadly trick other companies have also developed vaccines which appear to produce broad spectrum antibodies against many strains of the virus and many governments have ordered large stocks from various producers it is probably worth stockpiling many millions of doses before hn escapes into the human population because none of us has any useful immunity the virus could migrate around the world with the speed of commercial air travel not the steamships that powered the spanish flu if hn escapes and if it becomes as virulent as the spanish flu which killed of those who developed the disease the pessimistic predictions of millions of people dead within months could come true only if vaccine bottles were already on the shelf ready for instant use could the virus be contained however deadly as it could be and as harmless as it has so far been the hn avian flu will not be the last new influenza virus to develop the process that produced hn is at work every year and the more intense the agribusiness of raising chickens in china becomes the more rapidly new viruses can spread and mutate even if we may have dodged the hn bullet another pandemic like the spanish flu is inevitable and could break out into the human population so quickly that vaccines cannot be produced in time new types of influenza virus must be detected and combated while they are still diseases of birds not humans detection of new viruses will happen where they originate a global pathogen surveillance system as sen joseph biden suggested almost five years ago is necessary because the global first line of defense against influenza is not the u s centers for disease control and prevention but the public health agencies of china vietnam and other nations in that region those agencies need multilateral support and encouragement and the united states must take the lead and countries where flu viruses originate need the courage to recognize that reporting a new disease does not reveal weakness but rather demonstrates the strength
