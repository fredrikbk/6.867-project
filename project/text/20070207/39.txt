electricity group backs emission caps a trade group of electricity suppliers representing about one third of u s power generation is expected to call today for a federal constraint on global warming emissions the group the electric power supply association includes some utilities that generate much of their power from coal which among the fossil fuels commonly used to generate electricity is the dirtiest in terms of global warming emissions carbon dioxide the main greenhouse gas is produced when fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas are burned the announcement by the washington based trade group marks the latest sign that much of u s industry is shifting its position on global warming policy concluding it is likely to get hit with a u s emissions cap whether it wants one or not and that it behooves it to try to shape any eventual policy within the electricity industry duke energy corp the nations third biggest coal burner is among companies that have endorsed a national emissions cap duke isnt a member of the electric power supply association duke chief executive james rogers also serves as chairman of the edison electric institute the utility industrys biggest trade group which remains opposed to a federal cap even oil giant exxon mobil corp whose executives have stressed remaining uncertainties in the science behind global warming concerns has begun talking about how it would like a u s global warming constraint to be structured though exxon hasnt endorsed such a rule members of the electric power supply association tend to rely on coal less and natural gas more than do members of the edison electric institute coal produces more carbon dioxide than natural gas for every unit of electricity it generates so gas reliant utilities are likely to fare better under a global warming emissions cap than coal reliant utilities are still even the electric power supply associations members produce more of their electricity from coal than from gas says john shelk the associations president and chief executive "we have a lot of coal based suppliers " he says among them atlanta based mirant corp which according to the company generates of its electricity from coal "its in our best interest to find a way collectively to address environmental concerns while also finding ways to produce reliable energy " said felicia browder a mirant spokeswoman the association also includes the unit of oil company conocophillips that sells natural gas and power on the wholesale market that would appear to make conocophillips unusual among u s based oil companies in endorsing a mandatory global warming emissions cap but a spokesman for conocophillips said that despite the associations vote the houston based company doesnt support a mandatory emissions constraint "were still working on a specific policy " he said mr shelk the electric associations head said the group voted unanimously to endorse a federal emissions constraint at its board meeting last month he said the group wants a single national policy to supercede the patchwork of state emission caps emerging in places like california and the northeast but the association isnt endorsing any specific piece of legislation in addition because the associations members are "competitive" suppliers meaning they operate in deregulated markets some of them view an emissions cap as potentially a way to expand their markets
