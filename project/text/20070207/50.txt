german official prods g to weigh in on yen europes desire for talks reflects export concerns but sets stage for tensions berlin german finance minister peer steinbruck said the group of seven leading industrial nations will have to discuss the declining value of the yen at their meeting this week despite japanese and u s insistence that there isnt a problem europes desire to discuss the yen sets the stage for a tense meeting of g finance ministers which mr steinbruck will lead in essen germany on friday and saturday in an interview with the wall street journal monday he also asserted that hedge fund oversight should be part of g discussions despite u s and british reservations in europe there is widespread suspicion that japan is using interest rates to keep its currency weak and to make its exports relatively less expensive both japan and the u s have said the yens development reflects the state of the japanese economy "thats why this club was founded we have to talk about it " mr steinbruck said when asked about the yen the g includes the u s japan germany the united kingdom france italy and canada european officials have expressed concern that the bank of japans surprise decision last month to keep its interest rate at among the lowest in the developed world was partly motivated by a desire to keep the yen weak relative to other currencies luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker who presides over meetings of finance ministers from euro zone countries said at the time that he detected "political influence" in the decision christian de boissieu chairman of the french prime ministers council of economic analysis said in a separate interview that "i think the japanese are playing a game which is the game of the undervaluation of the yen this is good for growth and for the price competitiveness of japanese exports " bank of japan gov toshihiko fukui said the bank made the decision to hold interest rates steady on its own resolving to wait for more economic data higher interest rates typically strengthen a currency by making it more attractive to investors with borrowing costs in the nation euro zone at and set to head higher in march the disparity with japans interest rates helped push the euro to a record of yen last month japanese and european companies are strong rivals in world markets for goods including cars and machine tools mr steinbruck drew attention last week to the disadvantage european car makers have faced the past three years in competing with japanese car makers the view from the euro zone that the yen isnt trading where it should be is starkly at odds with washingtons stance in testimony to congress yesterday treasury secretary henry paulson played down european concerns saying the yen is "a currency traded in an open competitive marketplace " mr paulson said that "given some of the publicity coming out of europe " he will "look at the yen carefully " but that he could see no sign that japan had manipulated the level of its currency recently although the yen has weakened against the dollar too the u s s main foreign exchange concern remains the yuan mr paulson yesterday again called on china to make changes that will lead to a market based exchange rate in the "immediate term " european mutterings about japans currency and speculation about what g policy makers might say in essen have lifted the yen slightly to yen to the euro in afternoon trading in new york yesterday analysts said the yen could weaken again if the g s communique doesnt mention the issue at the meetings germany will try to establish regulatory oversight of hedge funds as a concern for g meetings officials in euro zone countries have called for tighter controls of the mostly lightly regulated hedge fund sector for fear that a major hedge fund collapse could trigger a crisis in financial markets or the banking system the u s and u k havent shown much enthusiasm for this initiative in the interview mr steinbruck sought to reduce expectations that concrete proposals to regulate hedge funds would emerge while germany heads g meetings this year "we are beginning for the first time to address the question how do we view possible systemic risks arising from the activities of hedge funds " mr steinbruck said "we are not talking about regulation we are talking about higher transparency " the european central bank and the german bundesbank have expressed support for specific ways of increasing transparency with the ecb singling out the idea of an international registry to which hedge funds would report their investment positions mr steinbruck declined to endorse such ideas at this stage saying his aim is instead to persuade others that the issue needs to be addressed at all many hedge fund managers say it is a myth that they arent regulated the u s government doesnt believe additional regulatory oversight is needed according to a senior treasury official "we continue to believe that market discipline and working through counter parties is the best way to think about and address systemic risk " the official said he added that mr paulson through the presidents working group on capital markets continues to look at the issue of hedge fund risk and regulation alistair macdonald in london and deborah solomon in washington contributed to this article
