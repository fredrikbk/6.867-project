tax break with a view landowners rush to take advantage of new law that boosts deductions for blocking development a crackdown on abuse muscoe r h garnett jr s farm in loretto va hasnt changed much since the family acquired it in the s now the retired insurance executive has made sure it will stay that way encouraged by recent tax legislation mr garnett has placed a "conservation easement" on much of his property located about miles from washington d c the move permanently shields the rolling pastures timber forests and croplands from being turned into a housing subdivision or business park under the easement which is a binding agreement typically made with a land trust the garnett family still owns the land and can continue to use it for farming and timber but most of it can never be developed landowners who place conservation easements on their scenic environmentally sensitive or historic properties have long been able to get tax breaks from the federal government and some states have also begun offering tax incentives now a little noticed provision in the wide ranging pension law congress passed last summer has made the federal tax breaks even more generous conservation groups say this has spurred a sharp increase in the number of landowners interested in placing easements on their property "the incentives are fantastic and i dont think a lot of people realize it " mr garnett says but the expanded federal incentives backed by some influential lawmakers from agricultural states are due to expire at the end of this year unless congress acts to extend them a bill recently introduced in the senate would make the changes permanent and president bush also called for them to be made permanent in this weeks budget proposal for now landowners might need to act quickly since conservation easements can take several months to put together heres how it works a landowner typically donates a conservation easement to a land trust a type of non profit organization that helps put together the easement and monitors its restrictions over time the value of the donation for income tax purposes generally is the difference between the lands unrestricted value and its new value with limited development or usage rights be careful though the internal revenue service and congress in recent years have been concerned with easement abuses in which donors have taken inflated deductions or placed restrictions on land with little conservation value such as golf courses the new law includes stiffer rules and penalties regarding appraisals to prevent donors from overstating the deduction for their land the irs says it is currently auditing hundreds of easements but the law is designed to encourage easement donations by allowing larger tax deductions landowners can now deduct the value of a donation up to of their adjusted gross income per year up from the previous ceiling of that means if your adjusted gross income is &# you are now eligible for as much as a &# tax deduction a year instead of &# and if your income is too low to deduct the full amount of your gift in one year you can now carry forward the deduction for additional years up from five years previously property held in family limited partnerships limited liability companies and some types of corporations may also be able to take advantage of the increased deduction limits says stephen j small a boston tax lawyer who specializes in conservation easements the law is even more generous for career farmers and ranchers who earn at least half their income from their land these property owners who are often land rich but cash poor can now deduct up to of their income "if youre a farmer you could pay no federal income taxes for years " says rand wentworth president of the land trust alliance a coalition of land trusts across the country colorado rancher jay fetcher in recent years placed conservation easements on two large parcels of his acre cattle ranch near ski resort steamboat springs the first donation on acres was worth about &# million for tax purposes but mr fetcher limited at the time to deducting a small portion of his income was able to take only about &# of that donation in deductions over six years "we left almost all of the donation on the table " he says mr fetcher is planning this year to make another easement donation on acres to a colorado land trust he expects the value of the donation will be about &# million and thinks he will be able to recoup roughly half that amount because of the higher federal tax deductions and an increase in state tax credits "the changes helped us " says mr fetcher still he says the financial incentives are secondary to his desire to preserve the land in his family since with its sweeping views of mountains and pine forest "our family has no desire to ever see the ranch developed thats at the beginning of it all " says mr fetcher the tax rule change has generated sharply increased interest in conservation easements say land trust officials from washington and wyoming to georgia "some landowners whom weve been talking to for five or almost years say that now it makes economic sense for them " says laurie wayburn president of the pacific forest trust in san francisco conservation easements can generate other tax benefits too they can cut estate taxes because the land is considered to be worth less under an easement a growing number of states offer a range of income tax breaks colorado and virginia for example give donors state income tax credits that are transferable which means that landowners who dont need the tax credits can sell the credits to other taxpayers for instant cash you may even get a property tax break depending on where you live conservation easements can vary a farm owner for instance could still retain the right to farm the land and to build a couple additional homes or barns but could limit the land from being further subdivided property owners can sell their land but buyers are obligated to honor the easement peter bance recently placed a conservation easement on acres of the virginia farmland that has been in his family since the property was zoned to allow construction of six housing sites and he donated the rights to five of those sites to a state run land trust he kept one site in case a descendant wanted to build a house in the future "we think we have a piece of heaven and we hope to keep it that way for generations to come " says mr bance who is an executive with wachovia corp if youre thinking of doing a conservation easement its best to contact a land trust in your area to find out if your property qualifies try www lta org the web site of the land trust alliance theres no minimum size but in order to get a tax deduction the property has to meet certain criteria such as having significant environmental scenic or historic value also be sure to work with a tax and legal adviser familiar with local applicable laws the land has to be appraised try www appraisers org the web site of the american society of appraisers and may need to be surveyed which can cost a few thousand dollars there are also legal fees to draw up the easement which can cost several thousand dollars depending on the complexity of the deal some land trusts also recommend landowners make cash donations to the land trust to help fund the organizations future monitoring of the the easement because easements are placed in perpetuity a family has to be sure it wants to permanently restrict development and the potential for a big windfall before committing several months ago after discussions with his wife children and grandchildren eslick daniel placed a conservation easement on his acre farm in columbia tenn near nashville the easement on the farm called "sweet easy " limits development except for a couple of building sites that dr daniels descendants could use for housing for dr daniel years old and a retired orthopedic surgeon the tax incentives werent a factor "we wanted to keep it where it would be open land for our family and for other people " he says saving the farm a recent law boosts tax incentives for landowners to donate conservation easements which limit development rights here are some highlights of the new rules donors can now deduct the value of the easement up to of their adjusted gross income each year qualifying farmers and ranchers may be able to deduct easement values up to of their income donors can take deductions for their contributions over as many as years the incentives are slated to expire at the end of unless congress extends them
