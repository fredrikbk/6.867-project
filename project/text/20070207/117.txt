style &amp substance the new fashion bloggers retailers review own wares at designer tracy reeses fashion show in new york on sunday a dapper blond man in the front row frantically took notes on his blackberry "drop waist " "striped hose " "patent shoes " he typed quickly as a series of dresses appeared on the runway two hours later he was at it again typing notes about how cardigans looked "terrific" over designer diane von furstenbergs dresses ken downing might look like any other reporter at the new york shows but hes the fashion director at neiman marcus the dallas based department store chain that caters to well to do shoppers starting today mr downing will post his reviews of around shows at new yorks fashion week on the neiman web site theyre part of a new marketing tactic that a small but growing number of retailers are using to help boost sales of designer clothing which has been a bright spot in a dismal apparel market but unlike other media covering the shows these commentators are in the awkward position of reviewing their own suppliers and their aim is more to boost sales rather than offer impartial critique "we all agree on our love of the sequin stripe sweater dress " said a commentary on nanette lepores fall collection posted yesterday on the web site of olive &amp bettes a chain of four trendy manhattan boutiques the anonymous blog is written by the stores marketing manager dawn fox who presents herself as one of "olive &amp bettes shop girls " online auction site ebay also has its own fashion blogger department store bergdorf goodman and intermix a chain of boutiques in cities have similar programs in the works at nordstrom inc "its something were looking at " a spokeswoman says ebay style director constance white who posted her first fashion week blog on friday acknowledges being "pretty gentle because we still do want to have great relationships" with designers mr downings critiques on the neiman site arent exactly harsh "the boys had as much fun putting this collection together as you will wearing it " mr downing wrote last fall in his neiman blog commentary on the d&amp g dolce &amp gabbana spring collection in milan "yellow shoes worn with black velvet and feathers for cocktail looked amazing i am all about yellow " mr downing wrote of ms von furstenbergs runway show sunday at neiman where mr downing reviews only designers whose lines are carried in the store officials readily acknowledge that the fashion directors musings are intended to attract shoppers to its web site which now generates more sales than any of the chains stores and when his comments are linked to the featured designers wares on the neiman shopping site neiman has seen a "sales bump" that "exceeded our expectations " says spokeswoman ginger reeder one million people who had previously provided neiman marcus with their email addresses were expected last night to get "teaser" notes directing them to log on to mr downings runway report this morning according to ms reeder robert cox president of media bloggers association a club for bloggers that creates ethical standards says these postings arent blogs but rather "clogs" his name for corporate web logs which usually have a marketing or public relations mission the retailers runway reviews come amid a radical shift in the apparel landscape the number of major department stores has shrunk and many that are left have made a big push to promote private label clothes high end designer clothing and accessories however continue to sell well and stores like neiman nordstrom barneys new york and saks fifth avenue are all trying hard to build loyalty among wealthy shoppers the store reviews also reflect the transformation of fashion shows once the purview of influential magazine editors and retail buyers who previewed designer collections twice a year into cultural phenomena nowadays tv shows and internet sites have sprung up to feed consumers growing appetite for information about the fashion industry and particularly the shows in posting reviews the retailers are taking a page from simon doonan the creative director of barneys new york who has developed a cult following as a columnist for the new york observer newspaper and web site since a barneys spokeswoman says mr doonans writing is separate from his retail job but while barneys doesnt benefit directly from his column its clearly an extension of his role as a fashion director attending shows pinpointing trends and helping stores decide what to showcase in catalogs windows and advertisements mr doonans column takes the form of social commentary in his eyes writing about the clothing on the runway is pointless as it wont wind up in stores for six or seven months "theres a real risk that everything is over hyped long before it reaches the hungry consumer " he says but he contributes to the hype lauding some designers "marc jacobs brought tears to my eyes " he wrote in last september he said mr jacobs "deserves a truckload of awards " certainly even some fashion magazines tend to gush about clothes designed by major advertisers neimans mr downing often focuses on fashion trends that might move merchandise "im seeing more and more accessorizing and it goes with the polished dressing thats in right now " he remarked after ms reeses show on sunday describing what he might say in his blog still mr downing who began reviewing the new york collections last fall and has covered the ready to wear shows in paris and milan considers himself a columnist and takes the job seriously though he has no writing experience he has a degree in fashion design usually seated in the front row in a spot reserved for retail executives he types notes and later puts together his observations in his hotel room and emails them to headquarters in dallas a marketing team pulls together images and cleans up spelling and grammar "the luxury customer is thinking about fashion very far in advance " he says "i want people to be excited and thats why i tell people about the trends and give them tidbits on how to make it work " runway riffs excerpts from retailers own fashion reviews olive and bettes shop girl on nanette lepore fall "ruffles bows headscarves and big fabric flowers for the hair added a touch of whimsy to nearly every outfit trousers were wide mini skirts had pockets every
