myspaces pact with google hits a snag news corp s web unit seeks deal with ebay causing some tension when google and myspace teamed up in a &# million online advertising deal last summer it looked like a marriage made in web heaven but myspaces interest in striking a separate deal with ebay is holding up the finalization of its pact with google the landmark deal struck six months ago gave news corp the right to use googles search technology on its popular web site myspace and carry ads brokered by google in return google would pay news corp a minimum of &# million in shared ad revenue over the next three years the biggest step taken by the media giant to cash in on the huge traffic visiting the social networking site the paperwork on the deal hasnt been finalized the delay doesnt threaten the &# million myspace installed the google links on its site in december and began receiving payments from google in january but points to myspaces online commerce ambitions before it signs a longer document finalizing the agreement myspace wants to ensure that the terms originally agreed as outlined in a hastily drafted deal letter of intent in august dont limit its ability to work with third parties such as ebay according to people familiar with the discussions myspace has been talking to ebay for several months about ways they could partner on what myspace calls "peer commerce " according to people familiar with the matter the idea is to let myspace users buy and sell items from each other using ebays online commerce technology and its paypal payment system these people said myspace users would be able to post items for sale on their profiles and their ebay auctions would be automatically updated according to one person close to the discussions under such an arrangement ebay would reach a younger demographic as growth slows in its core auctions business while myspace could tap a new revenue stream google isnt likely to favor any deal that promotes ebay services that compete with its own in the past months google has been increasingly encroaching on ebays territory google has added a listings service called base where sellers can post products for sale and an online payment service called checkout that competes with ebays paypal tension over the issue highlights increased rivalry between google and ebay the two companies have long described each other as partners and ebay is one of the largest buyers of search advertising through google but a person close to the myspace deal says google wants to encourage more ebay sellers to advertise directly on google that could eventually undercut ebays online auction and retail marketplace if sellers find they can attract buyers directly through google ads without having to list offerings on ebay the differences over ebay arent likely to derail the ad pact between google and myspace people close to the situation said both companies have been meeting their commitments since the beginning of this year and the payments dont hinge on the current round of talks a news corp spokesman declined to comment google chief executive eric&lt th&gt schmidt said in an interview last week that google and news corp are operating under a binding letter of intent and that he doesnt expect any major modifications when the final paperwork is done "we announced the deal and were going to do it " he said a google spokesman said ebay is a valued partner news corp likely has more at stake with google than with any potential ebay deal myspaces visitor traffic has surged since news corp bought it in and news corp expects its fox interactive media division whose largest property is myspace to break even in the year ending june with revenue exceeding &# million vauhini vara contributed to this article
