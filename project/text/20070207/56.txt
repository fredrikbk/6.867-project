how troubled firms skip bankruptcy court distressed businesses increasingly are choosing to restructure outside of court rather than filing for chapter a trend that reflects companies desire to avoid complicated bankruptcy proceedings amid new stricter laws the options available for troubled companies to avoid bankruptcy have expanded private equity firms and hedge funds have stepped in as lenders when banks are reluctant for many lawyers financial advisers and consultants the result has been a boom in out of court restructurings even as traditional chapter work has eroded with the decline in business bankruptcy filings "i am turning business away " cynthia johnson rerko a dallas lawyer says of her out of court restructuring work data on out of court restructurings are hard to come by but bankruptcy lawyers across the u s report working on a higher number of such cases than ever before many believe that trend accounts in part for the steady drop in chapter filings a growing number of bankruptcy cases involve out of court settlements more than a fifth of major bankruptcy cases from to were "prenegotiated" with creditors according to a database developed by lynn lopucki a law professor at the university of california los angeles that was up from of bankruptcy cases in the early s more cases are prenegotiated today mr lopucki says because landing a loan is a no brainer for most businesses "money is so cheap its hard to get into financial trouble " he says prenegotiation often gives companies additional time to plan before filing for chapter many troubled businesses use out of court negotiations to avoid bankruptcy altogether in november closely held furniture maker brown jordan international inc said it had avoided a chapter restructuring by conducting an out of court restructuring in which it obtained a &# million infusion the midsize pompano beach fla company had been &# million in debt "for any company looking at distress avoiding chapter is the goal " says jeff marwil a former attorney for brown jordan who is now a partner at winston &amp strawn llp in chicago "you want to deliver restructuring without filing " that impulse is common at companies of every size less than two months before delta air lines inc tumbled into chapter proceedings in september its chief executive told wall street analysts that "an out of court restructuring is the best way" for the airline general motors corp and ford motor co have spent the past two years in a massive out of court restructuring of their north american operations ms rerko the dallas lawyer says she often steers clients to out of court negotiations thats because they allow for more flexibility even if a "workout" becomes impossible she says ms rerko usually represents creditors in restructuring cases when negotiations failed last year for a client defrauded out of &# million in a cattle investment scheme ms rerko sued the debtor and obtained default judgments she and her client teamed up with three mounted cowboys brand inspectors and the local sheriff to round up a herd of the debtors valuable cattle on the wyoming colorado border "that got the debtors attention " she recalls "long story short by oclock that afternoon there was a million dollars in my bank account " lawyers say the growth of out of court restructurings is fueled in part by midsize companies expansion into international markets such businesses are often unable to resolve their cases through u s bankruptcy courts if the ruling wont be obeyed overseas says vince lazar a partner at jenner &amp block in chicago mr lazar pushed for negotiations in the recent case of north american bus industries inc a closely held anniston ala bus manufacturer that found itself &# million in debt the companys assets included manufacturing plants in hungary which mr lazar feared would prove tough to settle through a court north american bus was able to reach an agreement with creditors in many bankruptcy experts say formal restructuring proceedings have become too expensive and complicated since congress enacted the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act in that law set limits on the duration of chapter cases and increased paperwork for bankrupt companies and their attorneys that has spurred smaller companies into out of court restructurings as well lawyers say ed cordes a colorado "workout" adviser says such companies are intimidated by the rising cost of formal proceedings "there has been an increase in settlements because court proceedings have become more tedious to work out " he says while out of court settlements are getting more popular lawyers warn that the process isnt as easy as it sounds getting creditors and debtors to agree can be overwhelming many companies run out of money before they can begin negotiations in other instances if negotiations go sour the business can still land in the chapter court after having already paid for the negotiations until a bankruptcy is filed creditors can continue to hound the company for collections large companies often have a tougher time reaching out of court settlements because they usually have hundreds of creditors delta for example avoided chapter for several months by implementing a turnaround plan in the summer of but company executives soon decided the plan wasnt working and opted to initiate bankruptcy proceedings peter fitzsimmons a managing director of turnaround consultant alixpartners says out of court restructurings are also being driven by the arrival of new types of lenders to troubled companies hedge funds for example buy distressed debt from traditional lenders such as banks looking for instant returns they pressure borrowers to restructure quickly "there used to be fairly simple capital structures where senior lenders had a great deal to say about what happens " mr fitzsimmons says "now there are more stakeholders and distressed hedge fund holders that want results its in their interest to avoid bankruptcy or do lots of negotiation and have bankruptcy only last a few months " in the end successful negotiation relies largely on teamwork between debtors and creditors "im seeing more resolutions and more settlements occurring now than in the past says mr cordes "i think more people are realizing you just have to be reasonable and get things done "
