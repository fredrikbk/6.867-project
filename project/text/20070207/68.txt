in equity office battle a matter of scale with only hours until shareholders of equity office properties trust are to decide whether to sell the company to private equity firm blackstone group the outcome was still up in the air last evening if vornado realty trust comes in with a higher offer before the vote at noon est today it would likely delay the tally at least until the equity office board has time to consider whether any new offer resolves its reservations that vornados previous bids have had too many uncertainties at stake in this high noon gunfight is the nations largest office portfolio and bragging rights to pulling off one of the largest leveraged buyouts in u s corporate history valued at &# billion not including the assumption of equity offices &# billion in debt but the risk for the eventual winner is considerably higher than when the bidding battle began in november with blackstones initial bid in addition to the size the bidding battle involves two longtime kings in the commercial real estate world with equity office led by chairman sam zell and vornado led by chief executive steven roth and a relative newcomer in blackstone blackstone has become a huge player in real estate with acquisitions within the last months reflecting the aggressive strategy of jonathan gray the year old head of its real estate group whats clear is how much both blackstone and vornado desperately desire equity offices stake in more than buildings at a time of rising rents and falling vacancies in many markets with neither firm yet raising a white flag since jan when vornado first weighed in with a higher offer blackstone has moved up its all cash bid first to &# a share from &# and then yesterday morning to &# meanwhile vornado has increased the total amount of its cash and stock bid to &# a share and promised to pay the cash portion before a shareholder vote but at the same time vornado reduced the cash portion of its offer to from and didnt offer to pay equity office shareholders a fee if its own shareholders decline to approve its bid as of late yesterday afternoon vornado had no comment if vornado doesnt come in with a higher offer addressing equity offices concerns equity office shareholders are expected to decide that blackstones bid is superior even if vornado does increase its price most shareholders say they want a price above &# to make the decision a no brainer equity offices board is urging its shareholders to accept blackstones offer even with vornados agreement to offer the cash portion up front the remaining merger would still be subject to approval by vornado shareholders which could take four to six months according to a statement issued yesterday by equity office perhaps more frustrating to equity offices board is that vornados weekend offer came in the form of a two page letter not a definitive contract that could help the board assess whether the offer was truly superior to blackstones in its statement eop said despite repeated requests "vornado has failed to address significant contractual issues identified by the board " moreover equity office agreed yesterday to raise the breakup fee the amount that blackstone would receive if eop accepts a competing offer to &# million up from &# million last week and &# million when the deal was announced by equity office in november any offer from vornado would have to factor in that payment that puts blackstone in a seemingly enviable position either it cements its reputation as a determined investor that just sealed the biggest private equity deal ever by many measures or it walks away with a &# million consolation prize to share with its investors but some shareholders wonder if equity office directors are focusing too much on the risk instead of seeing the upside opportunity of accepting an offer from a company with a reputation at increasing shareholder value dean frankel domestic portfolio manager of urdang securities management an equity office shareholder says he is disappointed the equity office board agreed to allow blackstone to raise its breakup fee "blackstone is being treated as the brother and vornado is treated as a stepbrother " he says those familiar with the transaction say the higher breakup fee had a strategic role trying to force vornado to put a definitive contract on the table or to let equity office close the deal by the end of the week
