here the call by apple ringmaster in chief steve jobs for liberation of digitized songs from their antipiracy shackles has an uncharacteristically overt self serving approach that may dull its revolutionary message "thoughts on music " the missive posted by mr jobs on the apple web site appears at a time when consumer groups and governments in much of europe are treating the dual success of ipods and the itunes online store as a possible breach of antitrust laws since songs bought at the latter play on the former and not on rival digital music devices last year apple assailed proposed french legislation that would have banned such restrictions as "state sponsored piracy " the financial times notes mr jobs has apparently changed his mind but more than two thirds of "thoughts on music" is nonetheless a defense of apples digital rights management system or drm the coding aimed at limiting a songs usage to what apple and the recording companies will allow apples drm incidentally is called "fairplay " ipods mr jobs notes play music from any source as long as its in the right mp or aac format and "on average" though his statistical analysis raises questions just songs out of the that fit on the most popular ipods were purchased on itunes to obtain music from what he calls the "big four" labels universal sony bmg warner music and emi in order to set up the itunes legal downloading service which really was revolutionary apple had to agree to create a drm system he pleads and in a world where "smart people with a lot of time on their hands" try to defeat such systems maintaining a drm system shared with other vendors around the world would be onerous if not impossible he argues in other words people who dont like it shouldnt blame apple then on the st word of the word essay mr jobs lays out a proposal to abolish drms in language reminiscent of lyrics in the beatles songs itunes may soon be able to sell "imagine a world where every online store sells drm free music encoded in open licensable formats " he says "in such a world any player can play music purchased from any store and any store can sell music which is playable on all players this is clearly the best alternative for consumers and apple would embrace it in a heartbeat " that embrace however would only come if the big four agree to license drm free music he says and then he calls such a move in the recording labels interest because drms "havent worked and may never work to halt music piracy " and because the vast majority of their music is already sold on drm free compact discs to businessweek mr jobs has gone "from controversy to pr coup in a matter of words" with a "dramatic about face that could recast apples role" in the debate over copyright protection but "thoughts on music" may to some sound less like a true cry for change than a part of apples long running and successful campaign to cast itself as one of the good guys by adopting an already ascendant idea one former top lobbyist for the music industry hilary rosen suggests to the los angeles times that the recording companies have little choice because the market is going that way though the times notes such unfettered commerce poses risks for apple too music companies still smarting from the damage done by napster and kazaa tell the wall street journal its too soon to say how theyll respond to such a radical proposal but variety reports that such designs are already under consideration at emi which like other labels has undergone restructuring that brought in executives who want to establish their own ground rules and apple rivals like realnetworks have backed the idea for a while as the san jose mercury news reports pessimism from maliki congress doubts about the bush administrations latest plan seem to be growing in both baghdad and washington iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki yesterday told his senior military commanders that failure to carry out their part of the new security plan in baghdad and the continuing violence there were hurting the governments credibility with iraqis the new york times reports "this delay is giving a negative impression and has led some people to say that we have already failed " mr maliki said iraqi military officials have expressed frustration at the failure to bring in troops from other parts of the country on schedule while the choice of top army and police commanders was delayed "by sectarian disagreements with shiites objecting to sunnis and sunnis objecting to shiites " the paper reports defense secretary robert gates testifying on capitol hill said pentagon planners were looking into alternative plans in case the current deployment of additional u s forces fails to halt the violence adding that the administration strategy "is not the last chance " the los angeles times adds elsewhere in congress house democrats were pressing the administration on why large sums of reconstruction money for iraq was unaccounted for and why the iraqi government still has &# billion in unspent u s funds the wall street journal says a report from the house oversight and government reform committee also questioned whether some of the billions of dollars shipped to iraq after the invasion might have fallen into the hands of insurgents the n y times adds the journal says uncertainty about the unspent money might give the bush administration "a new obstacle in its quest to get more funds for reconstruction " the journal also reports that in anticipation of fights over iraq spending senate republicans with white house backing "are pressing for an early vote now to get members on record against withholding funds for the war " jewish business wisdom is hot in china amid the stacks of

eight most valuable business secrets of the jewish " "the legend of jewish wealth " "jewish people and business the bible of how to live their lives " and "jewish entrepreneurial experience and business wisdom " the washington post reports aspiring chinese businessmen and women in search of an edge have helped sales of such "success" books skyrocket in the past few years and they now comprise nearly a third of works published in the country publishers tell the post despite the association of such ideas with anti semitism elsewhere in the world "perhaps no type of success book has been as well marketed or well received as those that purport to unveil the secrets of jewish entrepreneurs " the post says "many of these tomes sell upward of copies a year and are thought of in the same inspirational way as many americans view the chicken soup for the soul series " he xiong fe a visiting professor in nankai universitys literature department tells the post he estimates that more
