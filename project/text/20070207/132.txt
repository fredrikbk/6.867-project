this insurance case could shake up the art market casino mogul and mega collector steve wynn grabbed art world headlines in january by suing lloyds of london relating to a september incident in which he himself inflicted damage to his multimillion dollar picasso painting "le reve" by poking a hole in it with an errant elbow the lawsuit seeks an order to force lloyds to expedite mr wynns claim for reimbursement of restoration costs for the painting for which lloyds had already agreed to pay &# to restore the painting and a consulting fee of &# meanwhile however a federal judges ruling in chicago on jan may well have a far more dramatic impact on the art world than mr wynns case in terms of how high echelon paintings sculpture antiques and other tangible assets such as silver jewelry and china are bought and sold in the u s the ruling by judge robert w gettleman of the u s district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division in the case of henry f and anne marie frigon v chubb group of insurance companies subsidiary pacific indemnity co wisconsin combines bedrock financial and legal notions with tabloid revelations surrounding one of the nations most well known and controversial dealers in american art richard h love of chicago as the judge said in his summary opinion the facts of the suit were simple the frigons are connoisseurs of fine art and have bought and sold it for a number of years through richard love said the judge at the heart of the case are paintings owned by the frigons that were consigned to mr love for sale and that the frigons insured through pacific indemnity under a so called masterpiece policy the policy covered "all risk" of physical loss to valuable articles unless stated otherwise or an exclusion applied in what could become a landmark decision judge gettleman ruled that because of extensive fraudulent and possibly illegal activities by mr love the definition of "loss" in an all risk policy such as the one by pacific indemnity went beyond the traditional definition of loss through theft or damage as in the wynn case to include a specific kind of "economic" or "financial" loss as revealed in the court proceedings the frigons problems with mr love started when they unknowingly placed their trust in an art gallery that was as judge gettleman said in his opinion "insolvent and had been for years " the frigons were in short the victim of a form of ponzi scheme used by mr love to help keep his gallery solvent and as a result prevent the frigons from receiving money for paintings that they had given him on consignment and that he had sold either without their permission or below an agreed upon financial value as outlined in judge gettlemans opinion the frigons had formed a close personal and business relationship with mr love who "tutored henry frigon in art history appreciation collecting and investment as a result of that relationship the frigons purchased most of their collection of early american impressionist art from the gallery " in building a national reputation mr love claimed up to the present day to offer a wide variety of work by american masters from the colonial period to the early st century artists such as robert henri george innes reginald marsh frederic remington john sloan and james abbott mcneill whistler among many many others periodically the frigons would place a painting with the gallery for resale under a consignment agreement agreements that are at the center of two lawsuits by the frigons one against love and his gallery which is still playing itself out in court and the other against pacific indemnity which has the deep pockets that love clearly doesnt a well informed source says the frigons purchased "a significant amount" of insurance from pacific indemnity between and the frigons paintings which include works by childe hassam carl w peters theodore butler louis ritman and robert reid were placed with the gallery on consignment pursuant to either a written form provided by the gallery or an oral agreement between the frigons and mr love as it turns out the plaintiffs alleged the gallery had been selling consigned items for less than the minimum agreed upon prices and then keeping the proceeds among such paintings "unlawfully" sold claim the plaintiffs were their works "by the end of each of the eleven paintings were disposed of by the gallery contrary to the terms of the consignment agreement through trades and or sales for less than the minimum prices " the judge said with the exception of two &# installment payments on one of the paintings proceeds from all sales went into the gallerys bank account without any notification of transactions to the consignors in spring installment payments stopped henry frigon became concerned and demanded that all his paintings be returned "when they were not " says judge gettlemans opinion "on april richard love admitted that all the paintings had been sold and that the gallery had spent the proceeds and could not pay plaintiffs the minimum sale price " it was then that the frigons and their attorneys bryan cave llc of chicago turned their legal attention to pacific indemnity making a loss report on may but the insurance company denied coverage the policy at issue in the case is an "all risk" one which as both parties agreed means it covers all causes of physical loss of the insured property unless specifically excluded "there is no dispute that the paintings at issue are all covered under the policy and that plaintiffs are no longer in possession of ten of the paintings " ruled judge gettleman where the potential landmark nature of the case comes into play is that the frigons and their attorneys claimed and the judge supported the notion of an "economic" or "financial" loss that occurred when mr love fraudulently "converted" the status of the consignment agreements without notifying the frigons or without giving them all but a small amount of whatever proceeds he received from the sales this definition varies from any traditional notion of "theft" found in most all risk policies and it was clear to judge gettleman "that each and every painting was sold in violation of the terms of the applicable consignment agreement moreover it is also undisputed that little if any of the proceeds from the sales went to the plaintiffs according to the undisputed facts the gallery simply took the paintings sold them or traded them for whatever it could get and kept the proceeds not revealing to plaintiffs that the paintings were gone " the judge cites two precedent cases in which a rightful possession became a wrongful conversion and then adds "there can be no doubt that the gallerys unauthorized sales deprived plaintiffs of their property " further the court concluded that the plaintiffs met their burden of showing a covered loss and the defendant had failed to meet its burden of showing an exception to coverage the frigons are seeking damages of &# million no date has been set for a ruling on those claims by judge gettleman john carver at the law firm for pacific indemnity chicago based tressler soderstrom maloney &amp priess declined to comment about the ruling or any possibility of an appeal given the breadth and specificity of judge gettlemans opinion and considering the standing of bryan cave an international law firm with a strong reputation in the art law field not to mention the high profile of the chubb group of insurance cos and the r h love galleries this ruling seems likely to shake up the way art transactions are handled in this country says scott hodes the lead attorney for bryan cave in the case "as a result of interpreting conversion of consigned property as a loss under an all risks policy insurance carriers may have to consider amending these policies to require prenotification of a consignment some consignments in turn may pose a higher risk to the carrier thereby requiring a premium increase " mr hodes who represents the artistic team of christo and jeanne claude among others adds "that insurance companies will have to be much more specific in terms of how they define loss in these instances " and dealers are going to have to act more specifically and carefully in the realm of consignments long a gray area in the world of buying and selling art in america the frigon decision if it stands is likely to open up a new era of more transparent and secure dealings in art work especially of the high end kind mr yahn is a writer and art and media critic living in croton
