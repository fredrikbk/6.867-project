subprime politics mortgage delinquencies are rising subprime lenders are going belly up another company filed for bankruptcy monday and the senate banking committee is holding hearings today on "predatory lending " all of this can only mean one thing congress is looking for someone to blame now that the housing boom is over the noted banking expert jesse jackson is scheduled to be a featured witness at todays hearing along with a couple of unfortunate consumers who were sold mortgages they couldnt afford to repay senator chris dodd chairman of the banking committee is in high dudgeon threatening legislation and talking about the american dream becoming a nightmare for those who cant make their mortgage payments its time for a reality check no one likes to see anyone lose his home to foreclosure and that includes the banks banks make money by lending to people who can repay their loans with interest lending people money they cant pay back is a lousy business as the many recent headlines about subprime lenders going bankrupt demonstrate if rapacious banks really had a goal of lending people more than they could afford to pay back they wouldnt be swimming in red ink related to this is the contention made by the same populists on the current "predatory lending" rampage that banks make money by charging them "excessive" interest but if anything the recent spate of bankruptcy among subprime lenders suggests that they were charging too little interest to compensate for the credit risk they were taking by lending to people with bad credit histories this is not to say that there were no mistakes made during the recent housing boom there always are excesses during asset bubbles quickly rising prices made a lot of people giddy on both sides and its now clear that loans were offered and taken that should not have been both the asset price increases and the lending risks were also facilitated by a prolonged period of easy money courtesy of the alan greenspan ben bernanke federal reserve the combination of exceptionally low interest rates over an extended period contributed to booming prices that encouraged lenders and borrowers to overextend themselves borrowers figured that if rates rose or things got sticky they could always sell for a profit lenders likewise became accustomed to lending with little or no money down from the buyer confident that rising prices would soon provide the buyer with an equity cushion meanwhile regulators at the fed and comptroller of the currency waited a long time to question some of the riskier lending practices however members of congress know its a pain to wrestle with mr bernanke over monetary policy and the comptrollers rules for mortgage lending dont make for sexy newspaper copy its so much more fun to knock around a couple of prosperous looking bankers so in searching for a scapegoat the politicians are returning to that old chestnut "predatory lending " they may want to think twice before stringing up the bankers though whether their borrowing history is good bad or indifferent americans enjoy some of the best access to credit of anyone in the world those no money down loans are risky for both sides but for many people the alternative is no chance to buy that house at all the politicians arguing for tighter credit standards are some of the same folks who deplore banks for "red lining" by refusing to lend in poor urban neighborhoods and the result may be less credit or no credit at all for the working poor or newly employed last week the percentage of subprime mortgages that were more than days past due was placed at just over in november the latest period for which figures are available thats the highest its been in years but remember this also means that close to of loans are still being paid off more or less on time tightening standards means not only "protecting" the who got caught short but also hurting the who stretched for a mortgage and are still making their payments lenders know that some percentage of marginal loans will go bad but they cant know in advance which loans will sour or presumably they wouldnt make those bets in the first place the only way to ensure close to loan performance is to restrict lenders to making only the safest loans this in turn means shutting out of the market a whole lot of people who may be "risky " but still manage to send in their checks every month for such borrowers a lender who makes a risky loan is not a predator but a gatekeeper to homeownership and the economic opportunity that goes with it we suspect that the vast majority of those who stretch to afford a home and sacrifice to make their payments dont need the kind of protection mr dodd is offering
