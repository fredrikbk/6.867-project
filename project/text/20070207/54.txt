heavy workload constantly challenged under stress and underpaid in response to the feb editorial page commentary "is &# per hour underpaid " by jay p greene and marcus a winters wow this is good news for my wife and daughter they thought they were making a lot less than &# an hour one is a full time teacher in the public schools and has a salary in the &# range of course she has to work only nine or months a year and she works only during school hours whoa im being corrected on that one too essentially she works months a year with months of school and one month during the summer vacation spent getting ready for the next year during the school session she arrives at a m and leaves around p m then typically spends three hours each night grading homework and preparing lesson plans my estimates are that her total compensation averages &# &# per hour kurt fischer plano texas instead of comparing yearly salaries which would show that teachers are underpaid the authors took the weeks that teachers work per year as opposed to the weeks of the other professionals and divided the teachers meager pay by their total amount of yearly hours worked which is about hours less than the average white collar worker a comparison of yearly salaries of teachers against white collar workers will show they are underpaid frank dangeli wakefield mass messrs greene and winters claim that because a teachers average pay is &# they are not underpaid they acknowledge that this average doesnt include the work teachers do outside of school but they waive it away saying teachers are hardly the only wage earners who take work home with them indeed many professional workers take some work home with them but few to the extent that teachers do when i taught high school physics i had a relatively light load of five classes averaging students per class it would take me about hours to read correct and comment on my students weekly lab reports in addition i needed to spend time outside of the school day developing lessons preparing materials correcting homework grading tests finding new materials overseeing detentions and more that time added up to at least another hours the authors also claim that teachers can use their free time to earn additional money from other employment indeed thats what i had to do when teaching of course professional jobs are hard to find when you only have summer night and weekend availability waiting tables helped me pay my bills but i dreaded the thought of one day having to wait on one of my students there can certainly be improvements made to the way teachers are paid but being disingenuous about the number of hours teachers spend working or about their prospects for additional employment starts the conversation in the wrong direction paul burney athol mass teachers work an average of weeks per calendar year weeks less eight weeks for summer break one week for fall break one week for december holiday and one week for spring break then add back two weeks for continuing education work often taken in summer for certification and advancement they work about hours a week five days in school from a m to p m plus an average of two hours per night for grading and preparation some of which is often shifted off to the weekends the above results in hours of work per year hours for weeks for a teacher earning &# per year a salary one may earn for the first several years of teaching the hourly rate is &# for a teacher earning &# a year a salary common to teachers with five to years experience the hourly rate is &# for a teacher earning &# a year a salary for to years of teaching experience the hourly rate is &# how do these hourly rates compare with the green winters numbers or with what you are willing to pay to attract employees for those of you who dont deal with up to students many of whom do not exhibit the interest and manners anywhere near the level exhibited by your colleagues or clients with no daily breaks lunchtime and a prep period per day are not breaks as those of you who have taught in public schools know the only time to prep grade and do required paperwork is during the evenings and on weekends having had full time public school teaching experience as well as full time business experience with a national consulting firm and a top tier university business school i can unequivocally state that public school teaching is at least as demanding as the workloads challenges and stresses placed upon middle to upper middle level business professionals james j eyster lansing n y
