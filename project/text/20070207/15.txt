business bookshelf from rig to pump and pipelines in between oil on the brain by lisa margonelli nan a talese pages &# it says something about the extraordinary efficiency of the u s oil industry when a california gas station owner confides that he makes more money more total profit not just a better margin selling bottled water than gasoline but the unexpectedness of this revelation in lisa margonellis "oil on the brain" also says something about us even though fossil fuels power our cars heat our homes and generally permeate our economy many of us know relatively little about petroleum as a resource and as a business ms margonelli a free lance writer decided to educate herself on the subject tracing backward the path of "black gold" from the gasoline pump to its sources the characters she meets in the course of her research range from a convenience store clerk at one of the countrys gas stations to a nigerian warlord "who changed the world price of oil with nothing more than a single cell phone call " she visits oil fields in chad and venezuela a texas rig and an offshore iranian oil platform bombed by the u s during a dispute in her research "took about four years " the author says during which she "traveled around miles " those years and miles would have been a waste of time and fuel if the companionable ms margonelli were not such a fine storyteller though she makes clear in the introduction that she is curious about oil mostly in the appalled global warming alarmist way that al gore would be ms margonelli has such a keen eye and acute ear that she cant help making petroleum a surprisingly vivid subject even readers who dont share her anti u s tilt might find much of "oil on the brain" fascinating much of the most interesting material has to do with gasoline and americas enthusiastic appetite for it how many drivers for instance who watch per gallon price fluctuations with scrooge like zeal realize that the detergents added to gasoline mark the only real difference between the pricey premium gas at a texaco station and the cheaper regular gas sold at the run down off brand station on the other side of town "gas is gas " ms margonelli states flatly gasoline separated by octane levels is brewed at the same refineries and travels through the same pipelines it is only at the "rack " where tanker trucks take on their loads that proprietary detergent packages are added to the gas making each brand distinct jobbers distribute low priced no name gasoline to the independents that constitute about one third of the nations gas stations its a tough business the combination of on the spot pricing and stiff competition makes for wafer thin margins one station owner explains to ms margonelli how overpaying by just three cents a gallon on two wholesale purchases resulted in a &# loss that took the profit from more truckloads of gallons each to make up such statistics are one of the attractions of "oil on the brain " which passes along plenty of others it turns out that oil moves quite slowly through pipelines at m p h a walking pace to m p h the average u s household consumes gallons of gasoline a year purchased in minute visits to the pump when oil drops to more than feet below the surface of the earth it warms to fahrenheit "less than the temperature of the fat used to fry doughnuts" with the heat acting "like a refinery" and breaking the oil down into methane butane and other gases though ms margonelli remains an appealing narrator as she moves up the distribution stream from gas pumps to refineries to pumping fields her reporting takes a wrong turn one is tempted to say a left turn about midway through "oil on the brain " instead of pursuing her story to its logical end by reporting on offshore rigs supertankers high tech exploration and other nuts and bolts of the oil industry the author who is now a fellow at the new america foundation becomes a globe trotting critic of american foreign policy the diversion is wholly unsatisfying her overseas travels start in venezuela where petroleum was first discovered in "the united states saw venezuela as partly its own creation " she writes in a sentence that begins the books alternative theme whatever is wrong in the world its likely americas fault the only surprising aspect of the authors by the book america bashing is that the main culprit is not president bush ms margonellis bogeyman is ronald reagan the u s military became a "fixture" in the persian gulf she says following president reagans firm response to iranian attacks on international shipping near the strait of hormuz in "the american public opposed sending u s troops to the gulf " ms margonelli says "but reagan used his folksy way to pitch the move as the answer to fears of another oil crisis " ms margonellis fixation on the u s s shortcomings is such that she cant discuss the iran iraq war without hinting that america aided saddam hussein in a chemical munitions attack on iran "theres no direct evidence that the united states helped iraq plan the chemical attack " she writes "but " "oil on the brain" might have benefited if ms margonelli had paid more attention to the economics of oil rather than the politics for instance she makes no mention of the oil price controls imposed by president nixon in august and later removed by presidents carter and reagan price controls on oil as well as natural gas were a significant event in the modern history of the oil industry producing terrible dislocations resulting in gas lines and shortages it was only after price deregulation that the market responded by investing more in indigenous exploration and development which caused prices for oil and gas to fall ms margonelli also overlooks the federal reserves key role in the world petroleum market crude oil is after all universally priced in dollars and u s monetary policy bears directly on the currencys value ms margonelli ends her book on a hopeful note oil she says was once "the original alternative fuel " in that it replaced whale oil in the mid th century as a source of fuel for lamps and lubricants for machinery "the next grand vision " she writes "has the potential to bring with it technology profits security and benefits we cant even imagine yet " in the meantime environmentalists have oil companies to thank for saving the whale mr kucewicz
