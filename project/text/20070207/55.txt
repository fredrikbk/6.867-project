hedge fund of funds im thinking of starting a hedge fund that only invests in the stocks of other hedge funds whos in most people think of hedge funds as secretive pools run by a bunch of cowboy traders shooting for the moon think again fortress investment group a hedge fund managing &# billion is about to go public and raise over &# million this aint pets com hedge funds are money machines keeping or more of investment profits fortress made &# million last year so why go public perhaps to distribute earnings as tax advantaged dividends or maybe like the rest of wall street theres nothing like stock options to attract talent most likely they want to get a lot bigger fast the institutionalization of hedge funds has begun and there are trillions of dollars at stake either way think of lays potato chips or cockroaches depending on how you feel you cant have just one goldman sachs the lead underwriter for the fortress deal and the lead source of the fortress talent pool is also probably their biggest competitor strange huh not really wall street has forever been circular remember there are more mutual funds over of them charging to fees investing in stocks than there are stocks on the new york stock exchange and nasdaq combined i might as well start another crop circle a hedge fund buying and shorting other hedge funds ill start with those that fund hollywood movies how cool is that i only wish i had the chance to short the failed hedge fund amaranth it seems like a new hedge fund opens every eight seconds up from maybe hedge funds in there are over of them today managing over &# trillion crowded not yet the hardest part is raising money but weve come a long way its no longer a max bialystock like hitting up of rich widows citadel investment group in chicago has &# billion in assets and employees in six offices world wide it turns out it also is one of the largest market makers in options taking wall street on at their own game lots of hedge funds make a market in currencies too long a profit center for banks circular indeed at stake are the &# trillion in various mutual funds and &# trillion in banks hedge funds want to end up managing all this loose capital fortress it seems has a model that scales to manage a lot more capital but so do others there are more publicly traded hedge funds out there than youd think its become cliche to say goldman sachs is just a giant hedge fund in wall street clothing and it is some say or more of its earnings come from a &# billion slush fund doing proprietary trading its "prop desk" is the farm system for future hedge funds trading for ahead of clients was almost two thirds of earnings and a big reason for its &# per employee bonus with their smarts and historic success goldman can easily raise arbitrarily large sums of money the company is fair game for my imaginary fund but so is jp morgan they realized its a capital raising game and have added &# billion in assets over a year since buying hedge fund highbridge morgan stanley slightly late to the game bought frontpoint partners and a minority piece of avenue capital group lehman brothers owns of osparie its too lucrative a game to pass up are there more hedge funds out there how about the nyse you bet its neutron bomb strategy of removing people and leaving the exchange intact is progressing with a publicly traded stock and the protection from the trade through rule itll soon put its own capital up and profit almost every time someone else trades now they want to duplicate this in europe and japan and who can blame them nasdaq is in close pursuit and the two may look more like hedge funds than exchanges over the next few years private equity giant kkr raised &# billion by listing a fund on the euronext exchange in amsterdam that would be a fun stock to short other private equity firms may package themselves up instead of their funds and hit up the public for cash anyone else ever look at general electric real close ge capital has &# billion in assets for loans leasing factoring equity finance insurance and commercial management if i can hedge out turbines and jet engines i can make its stock smell just like a hedge fund same with berkshire hathaway wall street hedge funds private equity mutual funds and probably insurance companies and the financial arms of giant conglomerates are all in the same game accumulating assets they can generate returns on but be careful these are big tectonic plates shifting around that are both working with and crashing into each other of course as these public hedge funds get huge their ability to find great investments diminishes look at fidelity magellan thats where ill come in as they balloon ill short all these public hedge funds who will inevitably disappoint and whose stocks will blow up improving my returns so ill end up with huge assets in my own hedge fund then in a final act of circularity ill go public and short myself i love this game mr kessler is author of "the end of medicine" harpercollins
