the afternoon report productive debate when worker productivity gains ground to a halt last summer many economists held a wake for the dear departed hero of the technology fired expansion but some fresh data may suggest a return from the grave as the story goes technological advances that took hold in the heady late s allowed companies to produce more stuff for every hour their employees spent on the clock that in turn allowed employers to dole out fatter paychecks to workers and rake in ever increasing earnings without having to jack up prices an era of inflation free prosperity ensued but the party seemed to draw to an end last year with the economy slowing down thanks to the sagging housing market worker productivity actually declined by during the third quarter that set off chatter about how the enduring productivity boom had finally reached an inflection point but the labor department said this morning that productivity rebounded smartly a quarter later rising as the economy got off the mat for the year productivity rose slower than the gain of a year earlier though a respectable performance given the midyear gulch still the years gain was the slowest since all the way back to the early days of the dot com age when all those work altering technological enhancements were still in the crib some economists thus suggested today that even with the fourth quarters apparent rebound the productivity boom is now rather long in the tooth bnp paribas economist brian fabbri wrote in a note that the slowdown "is consistent with an aging economy" and that the "lack of new business investment in equipment and software toward the end of last year will only exaggerate this trend in future quarters " others said that some fuzzy math in the report means that revisions to the downside are certainly on the way morgan stanley economists noted that the benchmark revisions to payroll data issued last week werent included in the productivity data and when those additional hirings are added hours worked will go up and productivity down labor costs meanwhile appeared subdued after ballooning by in the third quarter they advanced in the fourth with labor expenses apparently boxed in a forecast for gradual easing in inflation seems to be in order but theres skepticism rbs greenwich capital chief economist stephen stanley wrote that while hes not a big believer that wage hikes stoke inflation "we simply do not believe that economic activity has been soft enough to allow for meaningful slackening in labor and product markets as a result we are not convinced that inflation will come off at all let alone by enough to satisfy the fed " as though on cue philadelphia fed president charles plosser said in a speech this morning that its "an open question whether our current monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to return the economy to price stability over a reasonable horizon " cisco data stocks push higher the upbeat productivity
