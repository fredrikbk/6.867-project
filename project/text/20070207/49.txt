european telecom payback emerging markets ring up on rivals turf european telecommunications companies have been competing against emerging market rivals in places such as southeast asia and africa now they are facing off against them in a new territory their home turf financiers from india and russia to the middle east are sniffing around european assets they are following in the footsteps of egyptian billionaire naguib sawiris who helped pry open the door when he bought a controlling stake in wind telecommunicazioni in in a deal that valued the italian operator at more than &# billion and yesterday a company controlled by mr sawiris reached an agreement to buy tim hellas greeces third largest mobile operator by market share the price was about million euros &# million excluding debt from its private equity owners indias hinduja group and russias sistema recently expressed interest in telecom italia italys largest telecommunications company by sales pirelli &amp c the tire and real estate group has said it wants to sell some of its stake in telecom italia which it controls through a holding company pirelli recently said several interested parties had been in contact but no agreement had been reached representatives of hinduja and sistema confirm their interest but decline to comment on any possible discussions with pirelli for investors in europes telecom companies such interest can provide a boost to the stock prices of potential targets at least temporarily telecom italias stock rose in january amid reports of interest but it has given back those gains bankers and telecom executives say they expect to see more activity as companies from the developing world look to balance the risk in their portfolios with the steady cash generated by europes telecom service providers they believe emerging market companies can use their experience at running lean operations in developing markets to operate european businesses more cost effectively the interest in europe is surprising because it comes as many of the regions players are complaining their local markets are saturated and some are looking to developing markets in search of growth for now the emerging market interest in western telecoms is mostly focused on europe which hasnt yet seen as much regional consolidation as the u s that interest mirrors a broader shift in buying power as companies from emerging markets snap up assets outside their own regions recent high profile purchases include the acquisition by chinas lenovo of a division of international business machines and dubai port worlds purchase of peninsular &amp oriental steam navigation of london some investment bankers write off much of the noise from emerging market players around europe as bluster most of europes telecom assets are expensive and buying into europe can be dilutive to the growth profile of a company whose other assets are otherwise in faster paced markets other challenges for emerging market players in europe include language and cultural issues as well as political concerns particularly given that governments often view telecom networks as part of a countrys critical infrastructure kuwaits mobile telecommunications has grown rapidly in recent years through a slew of deals across the middle east and africa chief executive saad al barrak says he now is looking at making acquisitions in southern and eastern europe where the targets typically are smaller and the competition isnt as tough as in some other european countries the appeal of such deals for mr al barrak include building experience in handling more mature markets and diversifying the companys risk portfolio still he adds most of his focus for now continues to be outside europe in regions like asia "there are more lucrative opportunities in emerging markets that would help us access european assets at much better terms" down the road he says neil galloway head of european telecom media and technology banking at abn amro believes in addition to orascom and mtc potential acquirers could include emirates telecommunications of the united arab emirates and tata group and reliance communications of india also included in his list is carlos slim the mexican billionaire who controls telefonos de mexico and america movil mr galloway also notes that todays largest wireless operator by market value and subscribers is china mobile communications but he believes it could be several years before china mobile which only recently made its first foreign acquisition by buying a small pakistani wireless company starts looking in europe among companies he considers as possible targets midsize firms such as belgacom kpn telekom austria and greeces hellenic telecommunications organization known as ote another ambitious company is altimo the telecom arm of russias alfa group teijo pankko altimos finance chief says he is exploring the possibility of partnerships with companies such as swedens teliasonera and norways telenor teliasonera spokesman thomas westlind says the company has "ongoing discussions with different players all the time including alfa group but we never comment on the content of such discussions " telenor which is locked in legal wrangling with altimo over companies they jointly own in russia and ukraine dismisses the idea "we are looking for a way out or a divorce rather than going into closer cooperation " telenor spokesman dag melgaard says
