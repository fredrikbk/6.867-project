politics &amp economics indonesian mining stalls disputes over control halt development steps pressure commodities jakarta indonesia indonesia has some of the worlds largest reserves of gold coal nickel and other valuable commodities many of which have seen their prices soar in recent years yet mining companies havent broken ground on a single large new mine here since asias financial crisis the reason a fight between national and local authorities for control of the countrys natural resources that battle part of a wider struggle for local autonomy in indonesia could have important implications for global mining companies and world commodity prices in the years ahead other promising mining centers including mongolia and the democratic republic of congo are confronting similar debates whether these countries can get new ventures under way will be crucial in determining if commodity prices remain high for several more years or continue slipping as some have in recent months copper for instance is down more than over the past six months in part because of expectations of weaker global economic growth though its price remains high by historical standards opening more of indonesias major deposits could add significant new commodity supplies to the world market especially for in demand raw materials such as nickel and coal rio tinto ltd for instance wants to build a &# billion nickel mine on sulawesi island and estimates output could reach metric tons a year a large development like that could help reduce pressures at a time when nickel is near record prices but the development remains on hold as indonesia tries to resolve its regulatory problems mining has been one of indonesias top industries for foreign investment and the windfall from selling rights and taxing profits on new mines would be a badly needed economic boost for more than years there was little to debate indonesias authoritarian former leader president suharto kept a tight grip on mining selecting foreign investors and setting royalties and taxation regimes by decree investors such as freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc a u s company that in the s began operating one of the worlds largest gold and copper mines in indonesia enjoyed the certainty of this system but after mr suharto was driven from power in and democracy was established local authorities across the roughly mile long archipelago of more than islands began to demand a larger share of the wealth generated by minerals oil and gas the resulting friction has increased uncertainty over who is in control deterring foreign investors in some areas small scale mining operations mushroomed without central government sanction and some provinces levied illegal taxes on mining projects the central government says the central government has been trying to finalize a new mining law it hopes will settle such issues paving the way for a rush of new investment but the process has bogged down amid disputes many of them revolving around whether the central government in jakarta or local governments closer to the resources should set terms and conditions for mining operations politicians say the law is unlikely to be enacted by parliament before the end of the draft law is now before a parliamentary committee which has discussed only about a fifth of the bills provisions in the meantime indonesias mining industry "is going nowhere " says priyo soemarno executive director of the indonesian mining association whose members include rio tinto as well as other foreign and indonesian companies "we need somebody strong to say this is right this is wrong " to provide clarity for mining companies as politicians squabble over the law mining companies are keeping potentially large projects on hold this includes rio tintos nickel venture the law could also affect bhp billiton ltd which is considering developing two new coal mines on the island of borneo the delays mean indonesia is missing out on a golden opportunity mining companies spent a record &# billion on exploration globally in metals economics group a canadian mining advisory firm said late last year countries such as russia and china attracted significantly greater levels of investment than in previous years the report said by comparison exploration outlays in indonesia have dwindled before the asian financial crisis local and foreign companies spent an average &# million each year on exploration for new mines in indonesia according to a pricewaterhousecoopers report published in that figure had slumped to &# million by a tiny fraction of the &# billion spent that year on new mine exploration since president susilo bambang yudhoyono took office in he has tried to cut red tape and attract more foreign money to the resources sector he has made some headway most notably in resolving a prolonged deadlock between indonesias state oil company and exxon mobil corp to develop the &# billion cepu oil field in java but mining executives and analysts say mr yudhoyonos efforts are being undermined in indonesias convoluted bureaucracy a problem compounded by the power struggles "there is a disconnect between what the leadership wants and what others want " says alex gorbansky managing director of frontier strategy group a cambridge mass advisory firm indonesias energy ministry which drew up the draft says the law is in line with legislation passed in that devolved more political and economic clout to the provinces but critics including some big foreign and local mining companies fear giving power to local officials who lack expertise in regulating mining and have little knowledge of international commodity markets will make the system unworkable
