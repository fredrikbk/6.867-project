how one man riled the emerald trade cleopatra loved them wars were fought over them arthur groom wants to brand them a death threat over breakfast bogota colombia walking through this citys historic emerald district last summer arthur groom was approached by a man who sidled up and flashed a fistful of white folded papers containing cut stones "hello mr arthur hello mr arthur " the trader muttered softly wary of watchful eyes and not wanting to attract attention mr groom a year old jeweler from ridgewood n j told the man to meet him later in a small nondescript office nearby mr groom has good reason to keep a low profile in colombia the source for of the worlds emeralds a decade ago he began calling attention to common flaws in the stones and the secretive and often faulty methods used to disguise them now hes stirring up this sometimes shady nook of the gem world by becoming the first person to try selling branded natural emeralds just as de beers did with diamonds for centuries gem dealers discretely soaked emeralds in oils and resins before selling them to sometimes unwitting consumers eventually the treatments fade and have to be restored mr grooms answer is eternity natural emeralds a brand he launched in his gems are treated in a lab mr groom co owns using a proprietary technique and carry a lifetime guarantee hes promoting them in a glossy advertising campaign that ran in magazines including harpers bazaar over christmas and fancy in store promotions he sells to retailers across the u s and five jewelry manufacturers which tout eternity emeralds just as computer makers promote intels chips mr groom has received two death threats one personally delivered over breakfast he no longer lets his wife and two teenage children accompany him on business trips to south america and has sharply curtailed his own visits because of security concerns hes begun journeying to afghanistan recently hiking the remote panshir valley to visit mines hoping one day to bypass colombia entirely "i dont go out of my way to irritate the colombians " says mr groom "but i cant let them stop me from building my business either " quality and provenance are explosive issues with all gems but pose a particular conundrum in emeralds nearly all emeralds have fissures known as jardin french for garden because they often look like feathery plumes of greenery while there are flaws in rubies and sapphires they arent as visible to the human eye unlike the diamond business which is dominated by a single global trading giant de beers the emerald world is made up of hundreds of dealers working in some of the most turbulent corners of the world which makes the industry hard to value besides colombia and afghanistan another major producer is zimbabwe emeralds helped finance afghanistans battle against the former soviet union and later the northern alliances fight against the taliban "we dont know what the size of the market really is and i dont know that anybody does " says stuart robertson research director for gemworld a top trade publication that tracks industry data based on data provided by the commerce department the u s imported &# million in emeralds in but some dealers undervalue their product says mr robertson in part to avoid import and export duties the average u s dealer he says has a few million in sales a large dealer would be one with &# million people in the emerald world say they cant recall anyone else ever trying to sell branded natural emeralds aside from mr groom who says he has about &# million in sales there have been attempts to market synthetic emeralds mr groom was a young disillusioned stock broker in manhattan in the s when he first started dreaming of the gem trade "one day you were the hero but the next day you were a bum " he says of being a broker when he heard about a successful jewelry business owned by a co workers family he began to see jewelry as a way to wealth he used his vacation time to take classes in gemology eventually he started his own business arthur groom &amp co a store with glistening glass cases in an upscale shopping area of ridgewood about half an hours drive from manhattan he believes he was the first irish catholic to join new yorks heavily jewish diamond dealers club and opened a small office in new yorks diamond district where the streetlights are shaped like huge gems over the years he dabbled with other gems first buying rubies in myanmar and then rough diamonds in africa he decided to focus on emeralds after a trip to colombias emerald trading district which was filled with emerald cutters and traders and groups of men and women exchanging white folded papers by then the violence that characterized colombias emerald business had eased some died during a six year span in the s when drug cartels battled unsuccessfully with emerald miners for control of the business mr groom opened a large office in bogota occupying the entire top floor of one of the most prominent buildings in the emerald district and employed people to cut and polish stones he quickly became familiar with methods used to treat flaws visiting labs where pots simmer on stoves preparing baths to treat gems references to "oiling" emeralds can be found far back in history emeralds are thought to have been first mined in egypt around b c where they symbolized eternal life ancient romans associated the stone with venus the goddess of love cleopatra who ruled egypt just before the birth of christ had emerald mines named in her honor written records and discussions about types of oils became more elaborate only in the early s as gemologists began discussing the virtues and drawbacks of naturally occurring oils such as linseed rapeseed and cedar wood oil the oils fill the cracks and fissures camouflaging them but these traditional materials tend to dry out or change color inside the gem in mr groom acquired a company in bogota maker of a synthetic filler that expanded inside the gem to conceal its flaws the downside it sometimes shattered stones he quit the business and instead hired a scientist in new york to refine the process which he dubbed excel all mr groom will reveal is that excel uses a special polymer and a secret application technique he hasnt applied for a patent to avoid revealing his method in an article about mr groom appeared on the cover of a respected trade magazine "jewellery news asia " accompanied by photos an emerald in the "before" picture looked like shattered green ice the "after" image was lustrous and clear in other articles and speeches mr groom said jewelers and traders should always inform consumers about cracks and unsightly clouds in stones as well as the methods used to conceal them his comments set off a firestorm mr grooms critics especially those in colombia blamed him for hurting the industrys reputation and for implying that jewelers hid flaws from customers others accused him of denigrating his competitors to promote the "arthur groom" method the message was especially unwanted given its timing in a washington d c woman won a &# verdict against two jewelers who sold her an emerald ring that had been treated to cover a large crack which later reappeared the award was later overturned but the highly publicized case put a chill on the business that has never quite lifted fine quality emeralds that sold for &# a carat in dropped as low as &# a carat by and now sell for about &# a carat according to gemworld "when he came out with his technology it was very negative for colombia business thats why people started hating him " says ashok kumar sancheti a new york based emerald dealer says guillermo angarita a colombian emerald mine owner "nobody likes someone talking bad about your product " mr groom says he regrets the timing of his comments but doesnt mind the brickbats because he believes in his method "if i were head of boeing and i thought i had the best jet i would say so too " he says soon after mr groom was in brazil having breakfast with nanette forrester a gemologist who was then president of the american gemological trade association "one of the colombians came up and argued loudly with arthur and threatened to kill him right over the orange juice " recalls ms forrester mr groom says he didnt take the comments literally jeffrey e post head of the mineral collection at the smithsonian institution says part of the animosity reflects jealousy mr groom he says is the only one with the technology "if others want to do it they have to come to him " the industry has slowly been moving toward greater disclosure at least in the u s the gemological institute of america in unveiled a grading system specifically designed for emeralds assessments in gias lab cost about &# but even that process doesnt identify the filler just the degree to which the stone was enhanced "the jeweler is supposed to disclose to you what has been done and the customer should ask " says james shigley gias director of research but he adds many dealers consider treatments proprietary and resist telling buyers the nature of the fillers used mr groom is now focused on building his eternity natural emeralds business he sells branded stones to independent retailers and large u s manufacturers the clarity enhancement laboratory which mr groom jointly owns with his colombian business partner fernando garzon also treats other peoples stones charging anywhere from &# to &# per carat depending on volume traditional treatments back in colombia cost as little as cents a carat one of mr grooms clients is new york based michael gad considered one of the largest emerald dealers in the world amnon gad another member of the extended gad family isnt so thrilled with the jeweler at new yorks diamond dealers club recently amnon gad poked a finger toward a startled mr groom "you ruined the business " snapped mr gad he blames mr groom for making customers afraid to buy emeralds just before christmas mr groom bought a glossy four page spread in harpers bazaar along with smaller ads in other magazines he has staged about demonstrations at retailers across the u s bob kagan president of new york jewelry manufacturer cordova inc which is a customer says its too early to assess the markets response to mr grooms emeralds given the price of the jewelry that features them &# to &# he isnt expecting to sell a lot but he thinks theres an appeal to this approach "for the consumer it takes some of the worry about emeralds out of the equation " says mr kagan mr grooms challenge ultimately has less to do with branding than with the nature of his enhancement technique especially at the high end of the jewelry market many people balk at "permanent" treatments which they believe irreparably harm the value of the gem just as the mona lisa would suffer from a new coat of paint "when you guarantee the stone color is staying intact forever it brings up a whole other issue what are you putting in the stone to get that " asks bonnie self vice president of merchandise at fred leighton a madison avenue store that specializes in expensive antique jewelry she says the best way to reassure consumers is to get a certificate from an independent laboratory mr groom says if flaws reappear he will replace the stone or restore the old one he says he can remove the material he uses at any time thereby restoring the stone to its "natural" state as for outside labs he notes that most dont give buyers enough information to make an informed choice back in bogota mr groom has moved out of his big headquarters he scaled back after offending the colombian emerald establishment and now works out of a tiny two room office on the th floor of a building packed with other traders his name doesnt appear anywhere the center of the office is dominated by a large carved wooden desk with an array of tools laid out long tipped tweezers for picking up stones eye pieces for studying them against the light and a measuring scale one hopeful seller is gloria mayorga one of the few female mine operators in colombia a tiny woman with a broad smile she settled into a chair opposite mr groom and placed a white bundle on the desk inside was a large stone mr grooms partner mr garzon picked it up wiped the flat surface against his bald forehead the natural oil of his skin helps highlight fissures and studied it under his eyepiece when it was his turn mr groom eyed the stone using a jewelers loop he always carries assessing flaws obscured by a recent chemical treatment "its a nice bluffy stone " he muttered to mr garzon in english outside of ms mayorgas comprehension "bluffy" means it looks better than it actually is ms mayorga says nothing about how the stone was treated and neither of the traders ask they pass "the thing about this business is that it doesnt really matter what other people say to you " says mr groom "you can only trust your own eyes "
