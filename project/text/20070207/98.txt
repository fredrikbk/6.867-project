today kicks off a fund raising effort of volunteers working to direct donations from &# to &# million to her presidential campaign the million dollar target for some fund raisers demonstrates the overheated pace of the money race and raises the stakes for sen clintons competitors her allies will be able to generate that level of giving by soliciting checks of as much as &# the maximum allowed for the primary and general election from friends and family and recruiting others to become money raisers for their account "well do what we can to be competitive " said blake zeff a campaign spokesman though party caucuses and primaries are still a year off the money race begins in earnest this month as candidates try to generate big numbers for the first quarterly financial disclosure report due on march advisers to mrs clinton and republicans mitt romney and rudy giuliani have said their campaigns are shooting for about &# million in that first report this strategy designed to minimize the number of challengers and to solidify front runner status worked for the bush campaign in when it was entering a crowded wide open primary field one notable difference this year may be illinois sen barack obama whose appeal to voters may help him keep pace with mrs clinton even if he isnt first in the march tallies on july mr bush reported raising a record &# million in six months within days two republican hopefuls former ohio rep john kasich and new hampshire sen bob smith dropped out of the race by the end of the year former vice president dan quayle and elizabeth dole also quit after lagging in the money race "early fund raising shows an ability to organize and capture the energy and excitement behind a candidate and their vision " said jack oliver a senior bush finance official in and still the clinton camps million dollar target dwarfs those used by president bush in when he rewrote the campaign financing book by recruiting fund raising "bundlers " volunteers who raised up to &# by collecting checks of up to &# then the legal maximum from friends and family in mr bush created a new layer of top fund raisers who each generated &# in campaign donations dozens of

directors jonathan mantz the campaigns finance director recently declined to specify his fund raising target "its a huge number ive seen a lot of different figures whether its &# or &# million its a huge number " mrs clintons steps are increasing pressure on her leading rivals for the democratic nomination mr obama and former vice presidential candidate john edwards mr obama is scheduled to attend a los angeles fund raiser hosted by movie magnates david geffen steven spielberg and jeffrey katzenberg later this month he also is benefiting from a wave of new donors among african american executives the obama camp has attracted some democratic rainmakers including boston provident partners lp general partner orin kramer former dnc finance chairman bob farmer and florida attorney kirk wagar despite those gains mr obamas operation is behind mrs clintons in terms of organization campaign advisers are playing down expectations for mr obamas march report emphasizing instead the senators long term fund raising potential but he may have handicapped his campaign by opting not to accept donations from political action committees and banning federal lobbyists from bundling checks for the campaign the edwards campaign probably wont match money for the entire campaign raised by mrs clinton or mr obama said a campaign insider still the former north carolina senator is expected to raise enough to compete in next years primaries he attended a new york city event hosted by robert katz a senior director at goldman sachs group inc and maintains ties to the deep pocketed trial lawyer bar but most of the edwards money raising events are scattered across the country generally attracting smaller crowds on the republican side mr romney and arizona sen john mccain have waged a fierce campaign to recruit mr bushs former fund raisers as volunteers next month mr mccain will attend a new york fund raiser sponsored by nyse group inc chief executive officer john thain j p morgan chase &amp co vice chairman james b lee jr and new jersey attorney larry bathgate one of mr bushs most successful fund raisers in all the mccain campaign has recruited more than of the presidents former top fund raisers in addition to building a traditional finance operation the mccain campaign is ramping up its internet presence hoping to recapture the grass roots energy that temporarily sustained the candidate in after his upset victory over mr bush in the new hampshire primary mr romney has also incorporated web techniques including a system that allows his fund raisers to easily monitor and track the donations they solicit he opened his exploratory campaign with a fund raising event that netted &# million in pledges the former massachusetts governor will follow his formal campaign launch feb with a boston fund raiser two days later former new york city major rudy giulianis relatively late entry into the race this week puts him somewhat behind the finance team he announced this week includes veterans of the bush campaigns but mr giuliani lacks the lengthy roster of star fund raisers that mr mccain and mr romney have captured still mr giulianis deep roots in new york are expected to keep him competitive and his campaigns fund raising goals include raising more than &# million by the end of the year
