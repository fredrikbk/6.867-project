sec boosts probe for wall street leaks mutual fund complaints help prompt call for data in insider investigation the securities and exchange commission has asked nearly a dozen brokerage firms for trading and other data in an effort to determine whether there is a leak of inside information across wall street the inquiry is being driven in part by complaints from mutual funds and others who worry market participants are trading ahead of their trades before they are executed the request is an expansion of the agencys continuing "street sweep" investigation of potential insider trading which has mainly focused on the passing of inside information within a brokerage firm now the agency is expanding the probe to look at information being exchanged between firms in hopes of avoiding detection according to a top agency official the sec is looking at the "passage of information from one firm to another " said lori richards director of the secs office of compliance inspections and examinations "its just fact finding at this point " the data request reported in yesterdays new york times was sent by the sec three weeks ago the request seeks information on all stock and option orders in the firms order management system for a day period in late september as well as a list of customers that use the firms prime brokerage systems which are used by hedge funds the agency hopes that once it examines the data it will be able to determine if the concerns are valid and if there is a tipping chain from firm to firm the sweep is in the information gathering stages and not all examinations result in enforcement actions the new take on potential leaking on wall street was spurred partly from other enforcement cases the sec and justice department have cracked down on instances of traders passing information about large pending trades before they are public across the firms information boxes known as squawk boxes in addition the sec has filed enforcement cases against hedge funds and brokerage firm employees sharing nonpublic information about private investments in public entities or pipes allowing the hedge fund to profit before the pipe is public concerns about front running of trades arent new however worries have built amid the growth in hedge funds mutual fund company executives fret that because hedge funds typically pay higher trading commissions than mutual funds and generally trade more hedge funds may receive favorable treatment by brokerage firms the requests are considered extensive and officials at some firms have asked about whether the scope could be narrowed the deadline of late january has already passed but broker dealers routinely try to negotiate extensions an official of one wall street firm said it appears to be aimed at learning whether clients such as hedge funds are getting access to information about orders by other customers such as mutual funds the request seeks data on how each order was routed some of the firms protested the request questioning whether the sec would be able to handle the volume of data according to people familiar with the request ms richards responded by telling an official at one firm that she understood the request seemed broad one of the people said she explained it was needed to see whether customers who may have obtained information from one firm were trading at others it isnt unusual for firms and the sec to negotiate over information to turn over tom lauricella contributed to this article
