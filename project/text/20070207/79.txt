live long and prosper low yields make it hard call it the downside of a longer life the combination of lengthening life spans and skimpy yields on long term bonds have investors focused on a growing worry people outliving their money insurers ever mindful of the dark clouds behind silver linings call this "longevity risk " the idea that people will be blessed with more years of life but cursed with fewer dollars to spend in them to address the issue some pension funds and other traditionally cautious investors are tweaking their usual plain vanilla mix of stocks and bonds by dipping into more exotic investment schemes hedge funds private equity and other alternative investments that promise higher returns but also come with more risk the longevity issue is growing more acute because as life spans lengthen pensions and insurers are also being forced to put more money aside into long term securities their demand for these securities is one factor holding down the returns on these securities which in turn makes it harder for them to reach their goals one prime example in the united kingdom yields on year bonds are just above "low interest rates together with growing longevity are a big problem " says thomas hess chief economist at swiss reinsurance co the worlds largest reinsurer by premium income "it means individuals have to rethink how they will finance their old age and its an issue for institutions and the whole society " one study projects that the amount of money institutional investors sink into hedge funds will grow to more than &# trillion by from &# billion last year with roughly two thirds of the increase coming from retirement plans "its obviously going to be a little riskier than bonds but at the same time they just need the returns " says kevin quirk a partner in casey quirk &amp associates llc a consulting firm that conducted the study in partnership with bank of new york co many life insurers also have taken steps in recent years to address the issue by lowering or charging more for the income and return guarantees that come with their annuities these products promise payments for life or a set number of years however insurers are partly insulated from longevity risk because longer living clients mean insurers will also collect more in premiums on life insurance policies that they also sell ten and year u s government bonds currently pay an annual yield of less than the yield on the year treasury note has averaged over the past five years well below its plus average over the prior years these bonds are a staple in the retirement plans of people in the u s and elsewhere anchoring the portfolios of pension funds insurance companies individuals and governments themselves meantime the average life expectancy in the u s at years is way up from in a little more than four generations according to the national center for health statistics the persistence of low long term rates is a point of pride for monetary policy makers because it shows that inflation has been in check when inflation rises central bankers raise interest rates to slow down the economy and inflation but the prices that many retirees care about like health care are rising faster than broader inflation metrics and payouts in the bond market complicating the problem pension fund managers and u s life insurers have trillions of dollars invested mostly in bonds to pay death benefits and retirement income checks in coming decades according to figures from the insurance information institute and swiss re if these investments come up short the onus for retirement income and health care costs will fall on governments in many cases or on retirees themselves low rates are particularly annoying for u s corporate pension funds mr quirk said because new accounting rules are prodding them to do a better job of matching the durations of their assets and liabilities with retirees living longer than ever and year treasurys would be ideal tools for helping to pull this off if only their sub yields werent so disappointing the largest corporate pension plans projected as of that they needed an average annual return of to keep up with their liabilities according to research by j p morgan chase &amp co fortunately for pension managers rising stock prices have helped reduce the stress of low bond yields in the u s pension funds are in better shape today than they were after taking big hits during the to bear market but some still face shortfalls that threaten their ability to meet their obligations over the long haul a study of companies by watson wyatt worldwide found their pension plans were about funded in up from just above in larger companies seem to be closer to fully funded in the u k pensions pay less into government backstops each year the more closely their assets match up with the duration of their liabilities that spurs demand for low risk long term assets like gilts british government bonds this built in demand for these bonds helped push yields on and year gilts below for most of the past two years yields on short term bonds are higher
