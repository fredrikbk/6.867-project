business world the biggest secret in health care president bush might seem a candidate for ocd treatment what with his insistence that the fix for health care is tax reform he was at it again in his latest budget proposal which calls for reforming the unlimited tax break for job related health insurance where does he get such ideas the answer from every recent president that went before him including presidents reagan bush and clinton and from all the wonks in wonkdom whove long understood that the tax code was the problem and whove occasionally even shared this understanding with the public most recently during the heady days before the clinton health plan was submitted to a congressional dumpster a newspaper we know and love in reported as a nearly uncontested fact "the tax breaks on this enormous transfer of wealth have created a health care market characterized by inefficiency ignorance and excess " the head of blue cross &amp blue shield declared "the most powerful incentive is the tax code weve been through five decades of teaching the individual that health care is a free good " paul ellwood godfather of the clinton plan said "changing the tax status of health benefits is the glue that holds managed competition together " bill clinton himself said "there has to be some sort of personal responsibility in this health care system we set up " let the current president bush give voice to the same analysis however and it must be some kind of supply side hokum to rehearse the tax code is the original hectoring mommy behind our health care neuroses it gives the biggest subsidy to those who need it least it pays the affluent to buy more medical care than they would if they were spending their own money it prompts them to launder our health spending through an insurance bureaucracy creating endless paperwork it prices millions of less favored taxpayers out of the market for health insurance it fosters a misconception that health care is free even as workers are perplexed over the failure of their wages to rise clark havighurst a duke university sage points to one of the many destructive consequences "with insured consumer voters generally believing that someone other than themselves is paying for their health care they see no reason not to approve regulatory and other public policies that raise the cost of that care and foreclose opportunities to economize " he was thinking of the congressional rage to prevent managed care from saving us money after congress and everyone else first championed managed care as a way to save us money others point to a destructive consequence for the practice of medicine itself patients because their only skin in the game is their skin end up listening to doctors and hospitals who are massively incentivized to expose them to more procedures more tests and more drugs than patients quite apart from any consideration of costs would choose for themselves guess what the patients are right much of this superfluous care is bad for their health such is the finding of a long running dartmouth medical school study of national treatment patterns much better in our view would be simply to do away with the tax break and let businesses and consumers adjust the insurance industry wouldnt stand around and watch its livelihood vanish and tax rates could be adjusted to make sure the overall tax burden remains unchanged youd be shocked at how quickly the system would right itself alas there is panic on k street when anyone suggests doing away with the tax break directly the health industry goes ape think doctors hospitals drug makers insurers etc dont enjoy having a &# billion a year tax subsidy to encourage consumption of their products think big business doesnt like having a tax subsidy for a good chunk of its employment costs think they dont lobby so mr bush makes peace with the tax codes bias toward health spending in order to do battle with the particular vice of our overreliance on third party payment he does so by equalizing the tax treatment of health dollars whether they flow directly from a consumer pocket the vehicle here is health savings accounts or through a third party laundromat he would do so by equalizing the treatment of health insurance whether you buy it yourself or your employer buys it for you his latest plan no hosannas will not be sung to him by left or right however keep something in mind as the debate heats up the oft mouthed goal of expanding health insurance to the poor would be far easier to achieve if we stopped subsidizing overconsumption by the non poor theres a lesson in presidential leadership here mr clinton lost interest in health care after a few months when he discovered health care wouldnt result in a monument to his presidency in a very pre postmodern approach mr bush identified the same basic problem and has worked steadily away at it showing that a president can accomplish something as long as hes willing not to receive any credit the one great and glaring fault in his record is the creation of an unsustainable drug benefit to add to the unsustainable burden of future medicare spending then again what is unsustainable is unsustainable the pattern for that reform is already present between the lines towards greater reliance on saving than taxing towards greater reliance on individual responsibility than on the illusory free lunchism of government transfers for the problem of medicare is the problem health care writ small the illusion that somebody else is available to pay our bills for us see related letter "letters to the editor lack of affordability stymies health issues" wsj feb
