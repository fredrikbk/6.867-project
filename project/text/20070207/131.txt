theyre grammy nominees too when it comes to the grammy awards to be presented on feb by the recording academy formerly known as the national academy of recording arts &amp sciences glory goes to the winners in the big categories record album and song of the year top pop vocalist and new artist these winners are likely to reflect how the academys voting members are influenced by sales marketing and prior familiarity with the nominees the less celebrated among this years grammy categories which include far from the spotlight groupings for native american polka and childrens albums may be home to some of the most notable recorded music released between oct and sept but given the ceremonys emphasis on mass popularity those discs wont get the spotlight they deserve take those in the best jazz vocal album category diana krall gets the most press among the five nominees but the nominated albums by karrin allyson roberta gambarini nancy king and nancy wilson are special each in its own way on "footprints" concord the smoky voiced ms allyson delivers new lyrics by chris caswell to classic compositions of cannonball adderly john coltrane wayne shorter and others with new arrangements by bruce barth italian born ms gambarini lovingly sings and scats tunes by bill evans dizzy gillespie sonny rollins billy strayhorn and others on her u s debut "easy to love" groovin kind ms king who also guests on six tracks of the allyson outing is joined by fred hersch on "live at jazz standard" maxjazz covering diverse works by such composers as fats waller antonio carlos jobim and miles davis as for ms wilsons "turned to blue" mcg jazz the singer on the cusp of has much to say here about aging gracefully and she does so with easy elegance another out of the spotlight category thats rich with terrific music is best traditional gospel album though the message is spiritual the celebratory music on "an invitation to worship" zomba by byron cage and "alive in south africa" integrity by israel houghton &amp new breed straddles the line between gospel and soul with mr cage evoking teddy pendergrass and andrae crouch and mr houghton deploying that familiar stevie wonder quaver in his voice mr houghton and the group are also nominated in the best contemporary r&amp b gospel category in the rousing "finale act one" emi donald lawrence &amp the tri city singers revive some of their hits and with "still keeping it real" mcg the dixie hummingbirds uphold the tradition they helped develop more than years ago as for the caravans once the biggest group in the gospel field albertina walker inez andrews dorothy norwood and deloris washington reunited for "paved the way" malaco a live set that explodes with fervor and joy some of the categories offer a "which of these doesnt belong and why" challenge the new age category for example is dominated by the kind of lush synthesizer centric music thats characteristic of the genre but "beyond words" gt by gentle thunder a cree musician is direct and organic with a hammered dulcimer and percussion at its center amochip dabney and will clipman add flutes reeds and keyboards certain categories celebrate a single song on an album and it isnt easy to determine why a particular song was chosen over others in the country instrumental performance category bryan sutton and doc watson are nominated for "whiskey before breakfast" from mr suttons "not too far from the tree" sugar hill its a fine performance but hardly rises above the rest of a disc that features young mr sutton playing duets with his flat picking guitar heroes among whom the legendary mr watson is the best known tommy emmanuels "the mystery" favored nations is largely a display of the tender and not particularly country side of his acoustic guitar prowess "game show rag cannonball rag" is the nominated track probably because its performed at breakneck speed by that logic ledward kaapana should be nominated in the same category for his equally dazzling "th street rag sweet georgia brown" medley that appears on his "grandmaster slack key guitar" rhythm and roots but that album is nominated in category best hawaiian music the lack of consistency in what album or song belongs in which category can create an uneven playing field for lesser known artists in the best contemporary folk americana category guy clarks cozy collection "workbench songs" dualtone is up against nice work by rosanne cash and the short lived duo mark knopfler and emmylou harris whose nominated albums are more a blend of country and rock than folk also bob dylan is nominated in the category for his "modern times" columbia which might be described as americana because its built on songs by sleepy john estes memphis minnie hambone willie newbern and other american blues artists the fifth nominated album is jackson brownes "solo acoustic vol " inside a live set of his old rock and folk compositions and on it goes james hunters american debut "people gonna talk" rounder is nominated in the best traditional blues album category even though it contains new compositions by mr hunter many of which arent blues at all meanwhile in the same category dions "bronx in blue" razor &amp tie includes blues initially recorded by others at least years ago it will be interesting to see if voters go for the much publicized mr hunter who van morrison has championed or dion who during his year career has had doo wop and pop hits is in the rock n roll hall of fame but has been out of vogue for quite a while it may seem that the academy is splitting hairs by having a category for best song and another for best record the former is designed to honor the composer of a new song the best record award is for the team that created and recorded an individual track including the artist producer engineers and mixers its all but impossible to determine how the nominating voters arrived at their choices in the latter category does "put your records on" from corinne bailey raes debut album really sound that much better than many tracks that werent nominated as for best song each of the five nominees lists no less than three contributors which suggests calculation and construction rather than inspired composition the recording academy is rightfully proud of its annual celebration of a wide variety of contemporary music but its repeated use of the word "best" suggests quality is the deciding factor if youre a nominee in one of the more obscure categories or feel youre up against more renowned artists who are in the wrong category you may not agree mr
