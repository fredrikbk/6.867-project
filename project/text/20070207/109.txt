scavenger hunt small firms seek to profit from drug giants castoffs after dr huxley makes breakthrough novartis buys back medication basel switzerland over the past years drug industry researchers have looked for a way to fight heart disease by regulating an enzyme that raises blood pressure roche holding ag in switzerland began trying in the s followed by pfizer inc abbott laboratories and merck &amp co they all failed novartis ag gave up on its efforts when it decided they werent economical now such a drug which would be the first new type of high blood pressure medication in a decade is awaiting approval by the u s food and drug administration and could be widely available this year behind the new medicine is a year old biochemist who did something unusual in the pharmaceutical industry alice huxley was working on the novartis project in the mid s when the company shut it down she quit her job set up her own company and struck a deal to take rights to the drug with her all over the &# billion drug industry big companies under intense pressure to make hefty profits are shying away from long shots preferring to fund research into only the most promising projects that has left room for smaller companies to pick over the rejects and try to solve the chemical riddles that could lead to a blockbuster drug gpc biotech a german firm recently completed a large clinical trial of a prostate cancer drug that bristol myers squibb co had earlier given up on gpc hopes to win regulatory approval to sell the drug this year the charitable group cancer research u k last year set up a department to identify companies promising rejects and move them into clinical trials companies like dr huxleys speedel holding ag which first operated out of her attic say they sometimes succeed where drug giants cant because their entire business is riding on just a handful of potential drugs they invest a greater proportion of their resources sometimes all of them into one or two projects that heightened risk increases the pressure they feel to make it work they say scavenging from the big companies doesnt always pan out in december speedel suffered a big setback when it halted a late stage clinical trial of another drug a diabetic kidney disease treatment licensed from roche the trial showed that patients taking the drug experienced a fluid imbalance that can lead to medical complications including heart problems the news sent shares of speedel tumbling on the swiss stock market making the blood pressure drug called aliskiren even more critical for the company in the case of aliskiren dr huxleys company overcame hurdles in how the drug is formulated that bigger research labs couldnt achieve "what big pharma hadnt done in decades the little speedel did in a year " boasts jurg nussberger a swiss hypertension expert who has advised speedel on aliskirens development even novartis chief executive daniel vasella now says his companys drug developers made a mistake in quitting when they did "the fact that we are where we are is the best proof that they were wrong " he says under the deal with dr huxley novartis reserved the right to buy the drug back which it did in the deal gives speedel a share of aliskirens sales novartis now hopes it will be a blockbuster nearly one in three american adults has hypertension or high blood pressure which can lead to heart attacks and strokes the fda had been expected to make a decision on the drug in december but delayed the review by three months to examine new data showing its effect on the colon novartis and speedel say they are still confident aliskiren will be approved born and raised in bratislava in what was then czechoslovakia dr huxley moved to switzerland in to pursue a post doctoral fellowship in biology at the big drug company ciba geigy she stayed when it merged with sandoz in to form novartis she was working in drug development planning trials of drugs including aliskiren when novartis pulled the plug on the project because it believed the drug could not be manufactured profitably novartis was preparing to launch the blood pressure pill diovan and wanted to devote its resources to that project says james shannon head of pharmaceutical development at novartis dr huxley wasnt one of the chemists who discovered aliskiren but she was convinced the drugs manufacturing problems could be solved she had also just completed a management course and was mulling the idea of starting her own business so about a month after novartis shelved aliskiren she asked management for permission to license the development rights "i could have stayed at novartis " says dr huxley who has a doctorate in biochemistry "i had other products but i was emotionally attached " she took a kilogram of the white powdery compound in a jug and set up shop in her home she named the drug after herself alice plus a suffix commonly used with that category of compounds and she christened the company speedel short for speedy development and began trying to line up financial supporters and staff novartiss own start up venture fund gave dr huxley &# million in seed capital and continued to invest in speedel at key moments of aliskirens development on her way out of a meeting with the novartis fund one afternoon dr huxley ran into a chemist shed known from her time at the company peter herold had been a star at novartis helping create the molecule that became diovan for which he won the american chemistry societys "hero of chemistry" award he had also worked many years on renin inhibitors the category of drug that included aliskiren now dr herold was running a novartis spinoff that specialized in solving chemical riddles dr huxley hired him on the spot as a contractor to speedel around the same time she hired clinical trials expert chris jensen to start planning human tests of aliskiren their first meeting took place over coffee in the lobby of basels hilton hotel because speedel didnt have enough office space like other renin inhibitors aliskiren was designed to block the work of an enzyme called renin which helps start a chain reaction that leads to raised blood pressure two other types of hypertension drugs ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers or arbs block the chain reaction further down the cascade both types of drug are effective but the ace inhibitors are associated with a chronic dry cough in some patients blocking renin before the chain reaction could start had long seemed a better approach but creating a renin blocking molecule proved tough most companies found their experimental compounds lowered blood pressure in animals but were too big and complex to be absorbed by the human body others caused side effects or were too complex to mass produce affordably "because of these difficulties it was always hard to conceive that a renin inhibitor would be competitive in the marketplace " says dale kempf a distinguished research fellow at abbott who studied the drugs in the s dr kempf and others eventually applied their renin knowledge to discover some of the first drugs for hiv those drugs called protease inhibitors block the work of protease an enzyme similar to renin that helps hiv to multiply by the mid s scientists from ciba geigy had built a renin inhibitor that was simple enough to be reasonably absorbed by the human body but it was still too difficult to manufacture profitably speedel benefited from its location in basel one of the oldest centers of pharmaceutical research world wide the city is home to two large drug companies novartis and roche and to dozens of start up companies and academic institutes shortly after founding her company dr huxley gathered half a dozen local hypertension experts for a brainstorming session they met in the wine cellar of a traditional swiss restaurant in basel and drank only mineral water because speedel couldnt afford to buy dinner studying diagrams of the molecule they tossed around ideas for simplifying its synthesis dr herold took some of these ideas back to his lab and carried out a "retrosynthesis analysis " starting with the complete aliskiren molecule and following its creation backward to come up with the simplest processes and starting materials then mixing liquids and catalysts in round glass jars he rebuilt the molecule after a year he managed to build the drug in a simpler less costly fashion by producing one gram of the new powder in his lab he was able to extrapolate that the drug would be profitable to manufacture on an industrial scale out of curiosity dr huxley tasted the new powder and found it "a little bitter " she says dr huxley and dr jensen planned the first major trials of the drug in humans novartis studies had already shown that the drug lowered renin activity in animals and humans and that it wasnt toxic to ingest but no one had yet shown that the drug lowered blood pressure in humans with hypertension with the help of dr nussberger and another renin expert at the university of lausanne speedel in recruited healthy volunteers and gave them capsules of the powder dr huxley had taken from novartis to avoid wasting any of the precious powder the researchers filled the capsules by hand instead of using a machine the trial results showed that aliskiren decreased renin activity in the volunteers blood the early tests were promising but speedel was struggling with financing venture capitalists were skeptical about aliskirens value dr huxley recalls always asking her "how could it be something good when a big company stopped working on it " eventually speedel managed to raise enough money to carry out the first trial of aliskiren in people with high blood pressure the company hired eoin obrien a cardiologist and professor of molecular pharmacology at university college dublin to give the drug to nine patients and monitor their blood pressure round the clock for four weeks "it was a very crucial point " says dr jensen he remembers thinking "if it doesnt lower blood pressure were out of business " when the data arrived at speedels office by computer dr huxley stood over dr jensens shoulder to read through it the results were positive they showed that the drug lowered patients blood pressure and kept it low over a hour period the hour effect was important because most other hypertension drugs wear off after hours or so leaving patients vulnerable to high blood pressure and heart attacks in the early hours of the morning a high percentage of ambulances respond to heart attack calls between a m and a m as it prepared for a bigger clinical trial speedel hired a contractor to make kilograms of the new version of aliskiren but the firm couldnt handle the technical manufacturing requirements speedel had already lined up more than hypertension patients for the next big trial but had to stall for months until it found a different contractor able to make the drug eventually the second contractor came through delivering the improved aliskiren powder in plastic barrels the size of beer kegs dr obrien led the phase ii trial giving people with high blood pressure various doses of aliskiren or an older blood pressure drug mercks cozaar every day for four weeks the speedel financed study showed that aliskiren by blocking renin activity lowered blood pressure as well as cozaar did and at the highest dose aliskiren kept blood pressure lower for several hours longer than cozaar it was also associated with a "very low" incidence of side effects including fatigue and gastrointestinal problems according to the study results which were published in the journal hypertension in december in novartis funded a late stage trial of aliskiren in hypertension patients that showed the drug lowered blood pressure and kept it low for hours novartis submitted this and other data to the fda and hoped for a decision by december in a last minute snag the fda had concerns about an animal study showing that a rat taking the drug developed an inflamed colon so novartis submitted extra data showing that aliskiren had no negative effect on the colons of healthy human volunteers the company says the fda extended its review by three months to consider the extra data if the drug is approved for sale novartis will market it under the brand name tekturna the drug will be entering a crowded market there are several established drugs for hypertension that work well and some of these are now generic making them more affordable than a new brand name drug novartis hopes aliskirens hour control will help set it apart from other medications once aliskiren got to the final testing stage other drug companies began jumping back into the quest for a renin inhibitor in merck signed a research partnership with actelion pharmaceuticals a basel based biotech company with some innovative approaches to tackling renin dr huxley says she feels "tiredness relief and deep satisfaction" about speedels work with aliskiren the project has made her rich speedel went public in and is now trading at swiss francs or about &# a share her stake is worth &# million she has been knocking on drug companies doors looking for other experimental medicines to buy in and as roche was shutting down some areas of research speedel bought licenses to several of roches experimental compounds including the diabetic kidney disease treatment now on hold and in speedel bought the rights to an anticoagulant drug that abbott had given up on
