trailing big rivals emi group makes strategic changes when the first week sales figures for norah joness third album "not too late " come out today they will probably represent a rare bright spot for emi group plc but it is likely they will indeed arrive too late to significantly impact the fortunes of the storied london based music company whose blue note records released the disc with cd sales cratering its finances in a tailspin and no buyer on the near horizon the music company is making severe cutbacks and shuffling executives in hopes of regaining its balance in the unstable music industry it is the same gambit emi has tried several times in recent years to right its course yet emi home to such iconic acts as the beatles garth brooks and beastie boys as well as the worlds largest music publishing concern continues to fall farther behind its big rivals in the faltering music business current and former emi executives as well as people who do business with the company say that is because its focus on short term prospects has prevented it from devising a badly needed digital strategy emi has moved very slowly in focusing on the new digital markets downloads cellphones youtube and other online or wireless delivery methods that may hold the key to the music industrys future the job of leading emis digital strategy efforts was held by three people over two years and it commands a smaller share of the growing u s digital music market than it does of the fading cd market emi has also come up short in the industrys most fundamental tasks finding and cultivating new hit acts particularly in the u s that has left it dangerously dependent on a small pool of hitmakers chiefly ms jones plus the rock bands radiohead and coldplay who can ruin a years worth of financial results with a late or underperforming album in addition radioheads contract is finished and coldplay has just one more album left on its deal neither act has given any public indication whether it will stay with the company or leave the job of turning emi around falls to eric nicoli emis chairman since a former cookie company chief executive who invented a famous british sweet called the "yorkie bar " mr nicoli had never run a music company before coming to emi following the recent ouster of two key executives emi music chairman alain levy and vice chairman david munns mr nicoli will now take the reins of the companys recorded music division himself among his plans mr nicoli has indicated that he will attempt to shift emis focus to marketing its products to consumers rather than to middlemen like retailers and radio programmers the idea is to try to open new sales avenues a person close to the company says high level meetings this week are likely to include further restructuring discussions one possibility an effort to sell emi to another music company like warner music group corp or to private investors such deals have been repeatedly pursued or negotiated in recent years emi and warner alone have held merger talks three times since but always foundered on differences of price and control and regulatory concerns at a time when it is considered critical for music companies to be nimble emi officials changed the protocol for striking digital deals more than doubling the number of signatures required to as many as a dozen digital media executives who have done business with the company say it can take three weeks for the company to sign a contract after both sides have agreed to its terms these people say the typical interval is to hours mr nicoli said in an email that streamlining the dealmaking process is one goal of the recent restructuring "in the digital arena well remain thoughtful and deliberate in our deal making but of course we recognize the merits of greater speed " he wrote one of the few bold moves emi has made in this area is selling a limited number of digital mp files without copy protection of tracks by prominent artists including norah jones the experiment has been viewed as a success and people within the music industry have speculated that emi or another music company may soon embrace mps in a bigger way but it is also the only one of the four major music companies not to have reached a licensing agreement with google inc s popular youtube video sharing site a person close to the company says there are unresolved copyright issues standing in the way of a deal at the same time emi has been very concerned with hitting sales goals and slashing costs around the world an approach provoked in part by the fact that it has issued five profit warnings in as many years managers were regularly told that their forecasts for sales of cds were too pessimistic and ordered to increase them according to former emi executives to meet budgets managers employed old retailing tricks according to former emi executives they would dispatch more cds to shops than were likely to be sold booking extra sales say these executives and the unwanted cds would be returned months later after the previous budget closed the tactic isnt uncommon in the music industry because the difficulty of accurately predicting demand for a product as hit or miss as music can make it difficult to prove improper intent but at emi it was practiced with unusual frequency and vigor according to eight former emi executives and retailers in the u s and britain as long as a hit album saved the budget the next reporting period the approach worked out if it didnt similar methods were needed all over again only on a bigger scale to compensate for the actions in the previous half the executives said a person familiar with emis thinking says the approach was a disappointment at times explaining that based on radio airplay and other advance factors the company believed the albums would be bigger hits ms joness new disc appears poised to become the latest in a recent of string of releases whose shipments have been set up with such thinking in mind the company shipped at least million copies of it to u s retailers if first week sales match retailers estimates of around that will be well short of what such a massive initial shipment would normally indicate according to competing distribution executives and retailers
