in the eye of the beholder public designers at odds on whats a beautiful building its a question that has divided architects for centuries what makes a great building can it be found in the formal columns of thomas jeffersons university of virginia in charlottesville or the delicate glass walls of ludwig mies van der rohes seagram building in manhattan or the constantly changing mechanical skin of thom maynes caltrans building in los angeles nope those favorites of architects and critics dont qualify according to a poll of the general public to be released today the bellagio hotel and casino in las vegas however does a survey of americans favorite buildings and structures placed the gild encrusted italianate behemoth with its choreographed fountains at a lofty no on the list tucked between philadelphia city hall and new yorks saint john the divine cathedral "the bellagio i cant believe it " bellows edward feiner a director of the washington d c office of top corporate architects skidmore owings &amp merrill which has five buildings on the list "the bellagio is tasteless " in the eyes of other beholders though the bellagio is an icon elevated to that status in a survey commissioned by the american institute of architects to suss out how americans feel about their architecture in conjunction with its th anniversary the washington trade group asked harris interactive to develop a survey of ordinary americans they were shown photographs and asked to rate buildings nominated by architects in various categories some of the results werent shocking the empire state building was no the white house no but others were surprising the national cathedral in washington well known but certainly not an icon came in no beating out the golden gate bridge the u s capitol and william van allens chrysler building in new york also on the list apple inc s new glass cube of a store on manhattans fifth avenue the ratings as well as mr feiners reaction reveal the tension between architecture as personal expression and public art between form that pleases those who look at a building and function that nurtures those who use it "taste is a big word isnt it " says david rogers design partner at jerde partnership of venice calif bellagios architect "the idea of what people like and not what architects think people like is a wonderful testimonial to the actual experience and romance and excitement of being in a place that gives people pleasure " the results also accentuate the disconnect between what architects want to build and what regular people actually like in the last aia survey of architects in frank lloyd wrights falling water a house built atop a waterfall in bear run pa topped the list its no on the general public survey architects ranked thomas jeffersons university of virginia as no its not on the new list the new survey also could be seen as an indictment of contemporary architecture other than the bellagio no buildings from the last decade made it to the top only two in the top were built in the last years and both have special meanings the vietnam veterans memorial and the world trade center americans preferred older buildings that evoke ancient architectural styles such as gothic greek and roman traditions of the top only can be described as "modern looking " with square angles and lots of glass and steel some in the architectural establishment whose favorite building is often said to be an ivory tower say the profession is taking the survey seriously "the results are meant to get a dialogue going with the people who use the buildings " says rk stewart president of the american institute of architects one of his favorites however rafael moneos cathedral of our lady of the angels in los angeles failed to make the cut the association plans to post the results in blog form to get even more feedback at www aia org to mr feiner who is credited with injecting federal buildings with a jolt of high design when he was the u s governments chief architect the list is "useful in a way" because it "reinforces again that architecture is relevant to peoples lives even if its for the bellagio " trying to find a reason why it scored so highly on the list mr feiner says dale chihulys glass flower sculptures inside the hotel are "fantastic " mr feiner thinks the picks are less about architectural quality and more about emotions "if you look at that first part of the list its mostly washington icons its the attachment people have to them not that theyre necessarily great architecture " he says people picked what they perceive as important buildings churches government buildings sports stadiums "if you asked the typical citizen of rome or athens for their top buildings it would be the same list the parthenon the forum the stadium here we have camden yards " he says referring to the nostalgia tinged home of the baltimore orioles no on the list some architects are more dismissive mark robbins dean of architecture at syracuse university says the survey "reinforces ones sense that the general publics knowledge of architecture is still limited to things that are big and have columns or have a lot of colored lights " he says the list reminds him of the zagat guides to restaurants which rely on customer submissions "its only as good as the people who send in reviews when i lived in columbus ohio applebees was in zagats " to be sure the poll isnt a true reflection of how people interact and appreciate a building respondents were shown static photographs of each building online and were asked to rate them on a scale of one to five "buildings unfold in time and space and cant really be understood from a flat pictorial way " says mr robbins and architects complain that some keystone buildings in u s history are missing from the list richard meier whose spare white designs appear five times on the list with buildings such as the getty center in los angeles no more than any other living architect calls the results "fascinating " but he adds "many of these things on the list are places people go and enjoy themselves but i wouldnt consider them works of architecture " he finds it "very curious" that such modernist architectural standards as ludwig mies van der rohes seagram building in new york and farnsworth house in plano ill arent on the top nor is philip johnsons glass house in new canaan conn other notable no shows frank lloyd wrights johnson wax building in racine wis louis kahns salk institute in la jolla calif and the recent winner of the pritzker prize a top architectural honor mr maynes building for the regional office of californias transportation department in los angeles todd schliemann designer with james polshek of the massive glass box rose center for earth and space at the american museum of natural history in new york at no the top modern looking building of recent vintage completed in isnt surprised that the list is dominated by older traditional looking buildings "the older the building its a safer bet like an old sofa " he says michael lykoudis dean of the classically oriented architecture school at university of notre dame says "most buildings since world war ii have been preoccupied with a narrow set of criteria for a corporate client or for the architect that type of architecture cant have the kind of mystery that a complex cultural exercise like union station in d c has what architects see in pristine detail gets lost on people if they cant connect to it on the philosophical and practical level " mr schliemann says he is pleased the rose center is in the same company as those older buildings but adds "the recognition that i would like is to go up to nd street and see a snow globe made of the rose center that would mean it was in an icon that has some permanence as ironic as that sounds " corrections &amp amplifications the u s capitol and the lincoln memorial ranked no and no respectively in a public opinion survey of americans favorite buildings a marketplace article and an accompanying chart yesterday reversed their orders also camden yards ranked no not no as stated in the article wsj feb
