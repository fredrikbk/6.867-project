corporate focus business why key executives are warming to legislation on climate change in washington business opposition to global warming legislation is melting faster than the polar ice caps thats not because of new science theres been little of that in the past few years fridays update from the intergovernmental panel on climate change was mostly a yawn rehashing with greater certitude previous findings that human activity is leading to slow warming of the planet ever since seeing al gores movie ive been eyeing beachfront property and wondering what a foot rise in sea levels would do to it but the united nations backed study predicts sea levels will rise only a couple feet over the next hundred years posing a threat to a few houses in malibu california but not to most of us instead the changed business climate on climate change reflects an unusual convergence of personal practical and political considerations these have come together with hurricane force in the first few months of on the personal front three business leaders have played an extraordinary role in pushing this issue general electrics jeffrey immelt duponts chad holliday and duke energys jim rogers the three men were driving forces behind the group of ceos who called on president bush last month to cap greenhouse gas emissions and their influence reaches far beyond that breakthrough cabal messrs immelt and holliday have played important roles in leading the business roundtable which lobbies on behalf of the largest u s corporations to accept the need for global warming legislation mr rogers is chairman of the edison electric institute the u s trade group for investor owned utilities and is nudging that group along as well as a practical matter messrs immelt holliday and rogers argue that limits on carbon dioxide emissions are now inevitable indeed they are already in place in europe and coming soon to california and the northeast better to get the federal government on board they argue so businesses can plan for the future thats an especially potent argument for utilities which have to make investment decisions today about serving customers to years down the road then theres the political the election was a wake up call for business leaders reminding them they wont always have a business friendly government to protect them on this issue "the probability is almost that the candidates for president from both parties will be calling for some sort of regulation of co in the next election " says mr rogers business leaders who sign on early will likely have more influence in crafting the all important details of any legislation which could determine who wins and who loses "a seat at the table would help " says caterpillar ceo jim owens in addition ceos are finding that a green hue helps keep them in good stead with employees some activist investors and an environmentally conscious public at a time when ceos rank low in the publics esteem many are happy for a chance to burnish their public profile the about face by american business on this issue has sparked a sudden excess of enthusiasm at last weeks world economic forum in davos switzerland global warming was the subject of separate panel discussions overshadowing discussions of terrorism disaffection in the islamic world and collapsing global trade talks in washington global warming has been pushed to the front burner with more congressional hearings scheduled for next week bypassing critical national issues like health care and education conventional wisdom holds that long term problems like global warming always get crowded off the agenda by more pressing short term ones today that wisdom has been turned on its head if congress seriously wants to enact legislation capping carbon dioxide emissions this is the time to act the coal industry the oil industry and a few others may drag their feet but most of the business community will go along provided its a market based "cap and trade" solution that leaves business free to find the most efficient ways to reduce emissions and while president bush wont be at the forefront he is unlikely to block legislation that has substantial business support the problem is that it isnt clear democratic leaders really want to act their eyes are fixed on the election when they hope global warming will be a potent political issue they are reluctant to pass any legislation that the president will sign instead some democrats apparently think theyd do better politically if they forced a veto so the tables have turned after years of resisting action much of the u s business community wants legislation to cap carbon dioxide emissions and after years of calling for action some democratic leaders are now dragging their feet that means the earth probably will have to get a bit hotter and the oceans a bit higher before washington finally joins the global warming parade alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at
