health care reform involves all of us though well intentioned the schwarzenegger and romney plans are not only illegal they are placebos "illegal health care " review &amp outlook " editorial page jan they do nothing to resolve the despair most people feel over the exhaustion of the old order of health care and the absence of any new one not one of them will return us to the society that allowed physicians and patients to exclusively make decisions about treatments they will only appeal to some version of this irresistible though illusory belief the institution of "universal coverage" would only protract the policy trend that has monopolized and homogenized the health care system over the past years also while promoting a democratic moral contribution to "the greatest good for the greatest number " it would be in direct contention with the capitalistic and utterly american belief in absolute freedom of choice but the counteractive approach of "consumer driven health care" is no more viable because it is little more than the elevation of a disguise to reprivatize a health care system that is already generally privatized so long as we continue to deny the reality of health care as it is today we will continue to be sickened by the disease of expecting government to take care of our needs and responsibilities to cure the ills of the health care system reform must filter up from the people who actually use it lee h igel ph d assistant professor new york university school of continuing and professional studies new york
