hospitals take consumers advice satisfaction surveys lead to changes spectrum health adopts family centered care when spectrum health in grand rapids mich launched a patient survey to get feedback about three of its hospitals in late it got dismal results in addition to giving staff members low marks for helpfulness and attitude toward visitors patients and their families reported feeling ill informed about treatments in the hospital and unsure about instructions on how to care for themselves once they went home "it was a call to action " says matt van vranken spectrums executive vice president "there were fundamental aspects of the way we interacted with patients that were broken " to fix them spectrum adopted a health care model known as family centered care creating a patient and family advisory council to help shape hospital policy eliminating set visiting hours working with patients to determine who was authorized to hear medical information and make treatment decisions and calling patients at home after discharge to clarify instructions in an industry never known for attention to customer service hospitals around the country are borrowing a page from consumer oriented companies mining patient satisfaction surveys to identify patient pet peeves and service problems increasingly the survey findings are leading hospitals to adopt the family centered care approach which advocates building strong partnerships with patients and their families to improve care though hospitals have long conducted internal patient satisfaction surveys they havent always acted on the lessons learned according to a national health care satisfaction report from press ganey associates the leading provider of patient survey services to hospitals the health care industry in general "is not successfully responding to the opportunities for improvement presented by its customers " for the past two years for example "response to concerns and complaints made during your stay" has been at the top of press ganeys patient priority index which indicates "a communication disconnect" between patients and providers according to the report which is based on surveys of more than two million patients at hospitals nationwide but that is starting to change says deirdre mylod press ganeys vice president of public policy for the first time hospitals this year will be required to participate in the federal governments national patient satisfaction survey program to receive full reimbursement from medicare the results of patient satisfaction surveys will be posted on the governments hospitalcompare hhs gov web site later this year which will allow consumers to see for the first time how hospitals are ranked by their patients and how they stack up to rivals in an increasingly competitive market hospitals are also motivated by evidence that recommendations from friends and family influence health care choices to get a better idea of patient experiences spectrum health developed an "experience mapping" program with staff members following patients during their visits to various departments such as obstetrics former patients and family members on its new advisory council identified different goals to improve care including working with human resource staff members to "hire the right kind of people with a compassionate component built into their character" says diana smith a former heart patient at the hospital who serves as co chairwoman of the family advisory group "it starts with the person who parks your car " by the third quarter of last year spectrums inpatient satisfaction scores increased from the bottom third in the country to better than of all hospitals its aim is to lift itself above the th percentile at kansas university hospital in kansas city kan chief executive irene cumming worked with her staff to better respond to patient complaints including offering an apology such as flowers or candy when expressing regret that a patient or family member was upset about responsiveness or service staff can go to the gift shop and charge a "gift" to a central hospital budget the policy has helped increase the hospitals ranking for response to concerns and complaints by the hospital also puts up banners in different departments when they score the highest in patient satisfaction each week kent jackson director of behavioral health and chairman of the patient and family care team at st lukes hospital in cedar rapids iowa says the hospital has boosted already strong patient satisfaction scores over the last year by offering perks like activity carts in waiting rooms that are stocked with dvd players videogames for kids and loaner laptops with free wireless access for adults it also offers &# gas cards to compensate patients if long waiting times mean they have to come back another day for a test or procedure but it is also training staff members in better communication skills like the importance of making eye contact and smiling at patients mr jackson says hes drawn many lessons from the book "if disney ran your hospital " which has become a bestseller in the industry since it was published more than two years ago fred lee a former orlando hospital executive who wrote the book after working with disney for a year and a half says hospitals can draw important lessons from walt disney co s theme parks in the hospital patients may be satisfied if their basic needs are met and nothing bad happens and if staff members are professional and efficient but to attain the highest level of patient satisfaction hospitals have to do better than that mr lee says in an interview "a hospital without compassion is like disney without fun " mr lee adds "hospitals have to create an experience for patients that will make them go away with a wonderful story to tell "
