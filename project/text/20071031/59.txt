fretful investors shift assets as fed strategy haunts dollar while the prospect of an interest rate cut by the federal reserve may generate cheers in the stock market it is causing trouble for the dollar in anticipation of a fed move this afternoon the currency has hit a series of record lows against the euro in recent days late yesterday in new york one euro fetched &# against a broad group of currencies the dollar is at its weakest point in years a rate cut means investors receive a lower return for holding dollars which can prompt money to flow into investments in other currencies capital is "attracted to where its treated best essentially " says alan ruskin chief international strategist at rbs greenwich capital "one way its well treated is a nice high return relative to risk " the specter of lower returns a slowing u s economy and further dollar weakness is pushing investors to seek higher profits elsewhere particularly in emerging markets at the end of last year bond giant pacific investment management co a unit of allianz se known as pimco managed &# billion in these markets now the total is &# billion some of that increase is because of new business but some is a result of shifts out of lower yielding u s dollar assets said curtis mewbourne pimcos co head of emerging markets "youre getting paid something in the order of to for being invested in brazil much higher than in the u s " he said if the brazilian real strengthens against the dollar at the same time "youre winning on both fronts " until recently even as a slowing u s economy and large deficits weighed on the dollar the relatively high level of interest rates meant the currency remained an attractive place to park cash now that advantage is ebbing following the feds move in september to lower its short term target rate to from with gloomy news from the housing market and mounting bank losses investors expect the fed to announce a quarter point cut today that stimulates the economy by making it cheaper to borrow which in turn typically buoys stocks it is having the opposite effect on the dollar when the fed reduces interest rates and other major central banks dont follow suit there is "a disincentive to invest in the u s " said matthew eagan a bond portfolio manager at loomis sayles &amp co in boston the funds mr eagan helps manage have loaded up on investments in currencies other than the u s dollar he said "were at our limits " the underlying problem is that u s growth is slowing while the rest of the world pushes forward that means the fed is reducing rates at a time when other central banks are expected to hold rates steady or increase them the interplay between interest rates is a major factor in the dollars recent lows against the euro the benchmark rate in the u s is higher than the euro zones but the difference between the two used to be much larger as recently as june it was double what it is now as that gap has narrowed so has the premium investors receive for holding dollars instead of euros "the anticipated reduction and erosion of the u s yield advantage is the main driver of the dollars deepening losses " said ashraf laidi chief currency analyst at cmc markets in new york bond investors see the effects of shifting expectations a year ago the yield on a two year u s treasury note was more than a percentage point higher than on a two year german government bond today that same german bond offers a premium of nearly a fifth of a percentage point to its u s counterpart still investors said in some ways the u s and the dollar benefit from the fact that in absolute terms benchmark interest rates are higher than in europe "every single bank when they close their books is putting money here " said john taylor chief investment officer at fx concepts a new york based currency hedge fund "its big and safe and liquid and pays a high interest rate " some investors believe the market has become too bearish on the dollar if there were another bout of market turbulence like the one in august the currency could benefit as it did then "the dollar always rallies as a safe haven currency when these vicious meltdowns occur " said mark farrington of principal global investors in london moreover he said it is unlikely the fed will be the lone major central bank lowering rates particularly because growth may have peaked in the united kingdom europe and japan the interest rate scenario the market expects "is not going to materialize " he said
