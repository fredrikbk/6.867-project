for these sculptors the medium is big orange and stinky mr mosers masterpiece huge enough to squash him is no mere jack o lantern great valley n y muffled inside the inch thick walls of a pound pumpkin patrick mosers voice was an echoing blur "its beautiful in here " he shouted "its like carlsbad caverns " as a giant pumpkin carver mr moser regularly ventures where no man has gone before carving the behemoths isnt just an art he says its a personal odyssey and this month his journey has brought him to pumpkinville a rustic pumpkin farm tucked into a valley of the allegheny mountains where he has been commissioned to sculpt a hulking pale orange specimen harvested by a nearby grower cross breeding and better growing techniques have created a new variety of monster pumpkins called atlantic giant backyard farmers across the country are competing in weigh offs and the giants keep getting bigger up to pounds for the plumpest pumpkin this year but after all the competitions are over one question still looms what to do with all this fruit the size of hot tubs one answer has emerged in a new kind of performance art as more super gourds become available each year giant pumpkin carvers are in demand at zoos shopping malls casinos and botanical gardens these are no triangle eyed jack o lanterns these are gargantuan gnarly and lopsided freaks of nature with shells up to a foot thick in places and cavities big enough to contain a grown man transforming them into organic sculpture takes chisels power tools and perseverance the bellagio hotel and casino in las vegas hired carver gus smithhisler of marengo ohio to sculpt more than a dozen giants for an autumn exhibit in its botanical garden horticultural director audra danzak says she was skeptical at first until she saw a picture of a lions head mr smithhisler had carved from a pumpkin "it was quite spectacular " she said mr smithhisler was paid &# a day to transform giant pumpkins into sculpted vistas of corn and leaves and wheat for the bellagio professional carver hugh mcmahon of new york specializes in etching portraits into his pumpkins he is fielding a growing number of requests to do the faces of brides and grooms "its a new concept in wedding portraiture " he says scott cully of ashland ore grew pumpkins before he began carving them his first carving was born after returning from a weigh off with a pound pumpkin in "my wife and i had this pumpkin and we had two knives and we had two bottles of great hard cider we were really inspired " he says one of mr cullys specialties is pumpkin totem poles with three pounders stacked into a tower but his dream is to carve the first working cinderellas carriage using two actual pumpkins many giant carvers compare what they do to working in stone or wood but they face one problem other sculptors dont their artwork can rot before they even finish it bacteria will quickly liquefy a pumpkin into a stinking gooey mess professional carver steve dahlke of rosemont ill recalls one year when a restaurant displayed his pumpkin sculpture under hot lights hastening its decay "i had to use a power vac to suck out the slime " he says to mr moser there are few things nastier than the smell of a spoiled pumpkin "like a rotting beaver on the highway " he says to preserve his work as long as possible for weeks and sometimes months he has developed an "embalming" process in which he bathes his finished sculpture in antibacterial soap bleach and tilex bathroom cleaner "most people have no idea what goes into carving a giant pumpkin " notes the year old carver from jamestown n y before he can begin to carve at pumpkinville a farm that invites the public in every fall to stroll the grounds sip hot cider and pick out pumpkins for halloween mr moser must first examine the pumpkin from the inside earlier this month a tractor lifted one atop a sturdy wood frame then lying on his back below the fruit mr moser took nearly an hour to hack his way in shards of orange pumpkin flesh flew through the air clotting his hair and sticking to his brow as he hewed a large manhole in the bottom using first a kitchen knife then a large handsaw and finally a crowbar its dangerous work he explained grunting and panting as he heaved on the crowbar to dislodge a large piece "one slip and you could have a pound chunk o pumpkin comin at you from four feet overhead " climbing up inside the pumpkin with only his legs visible below he is able to clean out the pulp and seeds size up each internal crevice and gauge the depth of the shell in different places such knowledge will determine what shape the pumpkin ultimately takes on the outside "the pumpkin tells me what it wants to be " he says mr mosers trademark is the "grumpkin" the great pumpkin personality he finds trapped inside every giant he selects colorful names for his grumpkins characters at pumpkinville his subject was christened "rubin grogsworth " the crowd began to gather early saturday for the giant pumpkin weigh off contest on a table next to the still faceless rubin mr moser set out his briefcase of carving tools chisels and clay sculpting loops lemon zesters and super sharp microplane graters for his grumpkin face he then removed all the pumpkin skin and shaped smooth bulging eyes accented by a big nose and a broad toothy grin as rubin emerged slowly through the course of the day mr moser was both sculptor and entertainer telling pumpkin stories and fielding questions from spectators who crowded around in awe to answer the most common question is it real he let children see for themselves the carving is slimy and cold "like a corpse " he said "the kids touch it and theres an instant visceral reaction and boom they know its a real pumpkin " he lectures his audience on the differences in pumpkin flesh some pumpkins carve like cold butter some like hard oak but rubin is smooth and firm more like a carrot still it took mr moser two days to finish though huge to most people rubin is just a runt compared with some of the other giants being grown mr moser fantasizes about carving the first pounder "and i want to do it in a refrigerated cooler " he said "because that babys going to take a week "
