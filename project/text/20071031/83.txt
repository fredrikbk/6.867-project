record executive who has worked with artists like eminem and nas interpublic will pay &# million to &# million for translation says a person familiar with the deal it is part of a bid by the new york based holding company to reach more young urban consumers mr stoute years old creates corporate marketing programs that often link artists to companies partnerships such as justin timberlake and mcdonalds and jay z and reebok since starting translation in the company has created marketing programs for clients including general motors verizon and hewlett packard translation joins interpublics network of ad and communications agencies which includes mccann erickson weber shandwick and draftfcb with its focus on the urban youth market translation will compete with companies like spike lees spikeddb a unit of omnicom groups ddb worldwide the deal was earlier reported in advertising age interpublic is turning to mr stoute at a time when celebrities and companies are striking more complex deals sean "puffy" combs recently announced a deal to co market a brand of vodka for diageo that will give him half of future profits from vodka sales "the days of blatant endorsement where youre paid to hold a product and get your picture taken are over " says mr stoute "artists are looking for unique and strategic ways of coupling their brand themselves " with companies mr stoute talked to the wall street journal about the deal and how companies and celebrity endorsers are working together wsj interpublic has struggled in recent years why did you decide to go with them were you approached by others mr stoute we were approached by others they interpublic group were first it really has a lot to do with my relationship with draftfcb chairman and chief executive howard draft and my belief that all of the issues related to the company are things of the past i love being a part of a team where we understand that were not the market leader but were chasing the market leader therefore everyone has to stay at the top of their game to gain market share and be no i felt like i could be a big part of that team in helping to drive growth wsj what are your corporate clients asking for mr stoute how can we fit authentically with entertainment outside of advertising online how else can we use this dynamic to grow our market share with customers online and communicate our values and our products online and is there a space for us in gaming wsj what are you hearing from endorsers about what they want mr stoute endorsers want partnerships the biggest thing i tell my clients is manage the relationship not the contract if its all about an artist taking a picture with a product next to their face if thats what the brand endgame is then you dont have a relationship you have a financial transaction artists are becoming much more open minded its not like the s and s where big musicians thought working with companies meant theyre selling out successful artists are working with brands and the uniqueness of how theyre working together is whats being admired not selling out "selling out" is terminology of the past wsj sean combs just announced a deal with diageo to co market a brand of vodka and receive half the profits is this the new model for endorsement deals mr stoute youve got to look at the endorsers skill set the endorsers now have their own clothing line their own business interests that theyre looking to launch and get notoriety for and are looking for ways to work the other brand in order to do that the puffy example with diageo is one version of it by the way i think its a new day because you look at jay z and hewlett packard in the h p spots h p was actually letting the artists that were fortunate enough to be part of the campaign speak about the products they working with thats enticing to them believe me you can negotiate much fairer better deals when you use your media to promote an artists interest rather than to write them a check to promote your brand and by the way its much more believable more authentic to the end user wsj how will this deal affect your staff are there any other big changes under way mr stoute we look to increase our staff this allows us scalability theres a great opportunity in advertising right now the big companies are saying and acknowledging that there are solutions in boutique agencies good news bad news when youre a boutique agency taking on a customer of that size you need to provide ideas and have the resources to supply that kind of consumers global needs we have that issue right now we work with samsung i am looking forward to expanding our ideas and execution of our ideas with samsung through the global network we have an execution in five different cities in europe we will use our sister agencies to execute some of these programs outside of america in a way thats very transparent to samsung they include an entertainment program where well utilize djs to promote samsung product
