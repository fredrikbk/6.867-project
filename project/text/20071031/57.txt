for citi stakes get higher some question if sivs should be accounted on firms balance sheet wall street has a lot riding on the financial industrys effort to ease frozen credit markets by creating an &# billion rescue fund but no company more than citigroup inc supporting these off balance sheet funds known as structured investment vehicles or sivs is the heart of the rescue effort led by citigroup j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp accounting groups have raised the question of whether citigroup and other managers of the sivs should account for the funds many of which face potential losses on their own balance sheets a spokeswoman for citigroup said "citi is confident that it has accounted for the sivs it sponsors on behalf of investor clients properly and in thorough accordance with all applicable rules and regulations " the rescue plan aimed at easing a funding crunch at many of the sivs is part of efforts by the financial industry and government officials to instill confidence in credit markets investors worried about the viability of the sivs have backed away from purchasing the short term debt the sivs need to sell in order to operate citigroup is the largest participant in the &# billion siv market managing seven of the vehicles that hold a combined &# billion of assets neither j p morgan or bank of america manage sivs although they both have exposure to the vehicles through money market mutual funds that hold some of the commercial paper issued by sivs sivs turned profits for years before the credit crunch hit in july by issuing short term commercial paper and medium term notes to investors and then using the proceeds to buy higher yielding assets some of them linked to mortgages but investors are concerned about potential subprime exposure among these assets and stopped buying the commercial paper from sivs in august the funds still owe money to commercial paper holders if they cant raise money by selling new commercial paper they could be forced to unload the securities at fire sale prices the three banks are trying to shore up confidence and create a market for at least some of the sivs assets by creating a megafund that can buy highly rated siv assets backed by an estimated &# billion credit line from the banks the rescue fund will issue its own commercial paper to raise money sivs wont be required to sell any of their assets to the fund nearly bankers and lawyers are racing to put the plan together so far a handful of other banks have expressed interest in participating in the fund and bankers are expected to reach out to some financial institutions in coming weeks according to people familiar with the plan "there is a sense that time is of the essence " said one person involved in assembling the rescue effort that is particularly the case for citigroup which has been hard hit by the credit crunch that began roiling markets this summer chief executive officer charles prince already under pressure to pump up revenue and cut expenses is taking heat for a recent big stumble in the banks risk management strategies citigroup took a &# billion hit to its third quarter earnings as it recorded losses in its core trading operations and boosted reserves to cover bad loans in its consumer business citigroup recently announced it has secured funding for its sivs through the rest of the year but the banks predicament isnt lost on the people who are putting the plan together when the treasury department assembled representatives of the three banks in washington last month to discuss the crisis a citigroup banker offered the comprehensive plan that is now being put in action yet robert steel who is the top domestic finance adviser to treasury secretary henry paulson tapped a bank of america executive to coordinate the effort among the banks people familiar with the plan said there is some tension among the bankers involved in the rescue effort still they said they are confident it will come together the banks hope to provide a term sheet with details to other financial institutions and the siv managers by next week these people said if it doesnt work citigroup and other siv managers could find themselves in a bind that could force them to take financial hits if the rescue plan failed and buyers continued to stay away from the commercial paper market the bank might feel pressure to pony up cash to backstop the sivs to preserve its reputation with the vehicles investors who would otherwise incur the bulk of the losses but that prospect has raised the issue among accounting professionals about whether the bank shares in potential losses to such an extent that it should consolidate the sivs onto its own books according to the plan being developed the "super siv" will buy only high quality assets that meet a certain set of criteria the rest which is estimated to represent about of the &# billion siv market include assets that are backed by mortgages in the u s investors are particularly nervous about these assets due to the decline in the housing industry carrick mollenkamp contributed to this article
