streets bonus outlook is mixed compensation experts say financial services employees have a lot to be thankful for this holiday season despite the well publicized blowups at merrill lynch &amp co and bear stearns cos and significant write downs elsewhere profits on wall street held up better than some expected during the worst days of the credit crunch that began this summer that means bonuses arent likely to be as damaged as some predicted to be sure the outlook for folks in fixed income remains grim with predictions bonuses could come in as much as below last year but equities traders should do well as investment bankers are coasting on the wave of deals struck earlier this year and banks are going to have to pay up to retain key staff "it could have been a lot worse " said russ gerson chief executive of advisory and executive recruiting firm gerson group gerson along with some others is predicting year end compensation to be flat to up on average from where it was a year ago "if you asked us a month ago i would have predicted compensation down to because things looked so grim " he said that said there is still a lot of trepidation among bankers and traders bonuses and jobs are still holding up after this summers credit storm because wall street had strong results during the first seven months of the year but firms dont have that cushion going into "were not out of the woods yet and the repercussions from the summer are still rolling out " said james challenger chief executive of challenger gray &amp christmas this year for example could be the last hurrah for mergers and acquisitions bankers who face layoffs in the coming months now that the leveraged buyout pipeline has dried up "firms wont cut as deeply as they did before but they have excess capacity since the leveraged buyout market and the m&amp a market slowed considerably " said alan johnson a compensation consultant from new york based johnson associates inc according to challenger gray financial jobs have been cut in through september ubs ag lehman brothers holdings inc morgan stanley j p morgan chase &amp co bank of america corp and bear stearns have all announced cuts primarily in areas related to mortgages structured finance and credit trading bonuses are expected to vary widely among business lines and firms at places like goldman sachs group inc which continues to impress bonus payouts should be healthy but at places such as bear stearns and merrill lynch which were hit hard by the market turmoil and subprime woes the bonus picture isnt as bright those firms will push hard to pay top performers "merrill will be at a stretch to make ends meet for these guys " said randy ramirez a regional practice leader at bdo seidman llp a new york consulting firm "we know bonuses arent going to be good and firms are going to have to dig deep to make the payouts because they know the consequences could be even more costly good and experienced talent is hard to come by " bear stearns and merrill lynch have compensation and benefits expenses that are down for the first nine months of the year morgan stanley lehman brothers and goldman sachs have all set aside more money than last year for compensation and benefits "it may be necessary to accrue compensation expense at a higher level in the fourth quarter to appropriately reward employees whose performance will drive future growth " merrill said in its third quarter earnings release it is a given firms will pay their big producers those who work in equities or investment banking and were involved in the big m&amp a deals earlier this year will come out on top but those in fixed income structured products and mortgage backed securities have already been bracing themselves for dismal payouts "fixed income desks could see bonuses up to lower this year versus last year and thousands of jobs will be lost by years end " said michael karp chief executive of the options group a global executive search and compensation consulting firm in new york in a reversal from last year the wall street crowd is more cautious "they havent started to shop yet " said jeff falk president of bmw of manhattan "they are going to wait longer to do their shopping only because they want a better handle on bonuses and dont want to guesstimate theyll wait to see fourth quarter numbers before they do anything crazy " the same sentiment has spread to the manhattan real estate market which is historically tied to the strength of the financial market "everyone knows the bonuses arent going to go with the pace we had last year when the frenzy started earlier " said faith hope consolo chairman of the real estate and leasing division at prudential douglas elliman real estate in new york "this year things will start later " despite the prediction of lower bonuses new york luxury real estate firm brown harris stevens expects people to shop "the less may change the price they are willing to pay or what they are looking at " president hall wilkie said "but theyll still look "
