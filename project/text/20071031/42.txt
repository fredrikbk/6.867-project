down by the riverside development spurs debate dallas this city for decades has haggled over how to develop the banks of its trinity river a mile long swath of water and grassland slicing right by downtown now an ambitious &# billion plan to develop the flood channel as a park lakes and a six lane tollway could be derailed amid a battle between a lone dallas councilwoman and much of the rest of the citys political and business establishment voters in this city of million will decide tuesday whether to scrap the tollway at stake supporters say are billions of dollars in related highway improvements to ease traffic congestion and a boon to downtown property values and recreation those against the tollway say it has wrongly taken precedence over the projects public park they also say the road will mainly benefit wealthy property owners angling to develop condos and office towers near the river "do we want a world class park in the heart of dallas or do we want a high speed tollway to ruin that " said angela hunt a year old commercial lawyer elected to dallas council in who is leading the opposition cities across the country are trying to turn rivers and lakefronts into assets but those efforts often spark big debates over whether transportation should supersede recreation buffalo n y residents are asking gov eliot spitzer to block an impending revamp of an elevated three mile section of route which blocks recreational access to lake erie and instead scale it back to a smaller boulevard in milwaukee tore down the one mile park east freeway spur along the milwaukee river to give residents and developers better access to the riverfront cities such as grand forks n d and some suburbs of chicago have installed parks within flood plains as dallas intends to do but dallas plan to build a nine mile road along a rivers flood prone banks is unusual establishing a major thoroughfare on the water side of a levee is rare if not unprecedented and could complicate flood control that said the u s army corps of engineers hasnt blocked the idea outright and instead has set high standards for the projects engineering specifications such as the strength of its base and its drainage system for keeping runoff from the road including oil and antifreeze from seeping into the river dallas stretch of the trinity river is bracketed by foot high levees most of the time the river is little more than a large stream leaving a massive half mile wide ribbon of undeveloped green space bisecting the citys core occasionally heavy rains swell the trinity into a leviathan that laps against both levees it usually recedes within days and it hasnt topped its levees in the more than years the army corps of engineers has managed the flood plain as planned the road will be built feet above the flood corridors floor atop an earthen base that would put it two feet higher than the anticipated water line in a year flood in typical texas style dallas plans to develop the swath are ambitious they call for digging lakes building parks and erecting bridges for cars and pedestrians planners envision creating bends in some stretches of the river to foster different water habitats as well as a kayak run with man made rapids in one section a acre tract in the corridors forested southern end will host the &# million trinity river audubon center which will have exhibits promoting river habitat conservation and discussing the rivers place in dallas history at the center of the campaign to block the tollway is ms hunt as a freshman councilmember she studied the trinity river project and saw that the tollway which is projected to have a speed limit of mph had morphed into a much larger entity than the four lane mph road initially envisioned a decade ago the roads expansion had come at the expense of the projects park the very amenity that carried the vote in when dallas approved &# million in bonds for the project she says ms hunt found allies in a band of environmentalists and conservationists who long opposed the tollway among them is jim schutze a prominent city hall columnist for the dallas observer newspaper who frequently needles city officials for alleged favoritism and short sightedness mr schutze and others point to a city funded economic impact report that predicts the trinity river project will produce "a positive effect on the value of real estate throughout the corridor" and estimates a to rise in property values for the area thus mr schutze and other opponents conclude landowners with significant holdings downtown stand to reap the most benefit from the access the road brings to their properties "they see this road as crucial to redevelop their land " says mr schutze who has relentlessly attacked the tollway in his column earlier this year ms hunt and her supporters gathered more than signatures from dallas voters to put the issue on the citys november ballot "do we want to create beautiful places and attract the creative class to dallas " ms hunt says "or will the city sacrifice its only natural asset in order to shave a few minutes off of a suburban commuters trip " the coalition opposing ms hunt is vast joining dallas mayor tom leppert and ms hunts council colleagues to fight the referendum are most of the areas local state and federal politicians chambers of commerce and business leaders even maverick former mayor laura miller who rarely missed an opportunity to challenge developers seeking city subsidies considers the six lane tollway acceptable in light of the recreational and scenic uses that will come with it including an estimated miles of trails and soccer fields among those who have donated to a political action committee opposing the referendum are apartment developer jpi multifamily investments lp harlan crow son of dallas real estate magnate trammell crow and margot perot wife of electronic data systems corp founder h ross perot the dallas citizens council a group of roughly of the citys business elite provided &# of the protollway committees &# million in funds raised mr crow waves off the allegation that he and other downtown property owners are maneuvering to benefit their own properties he characterized his downtown holdings which include the room hilton anatole hotel and the dallas market center wholesale complex as a fraction of his familys real estate portfolio "in terms of my personal financial benefit it doesnt make any difference at all " he says "if you make dallas a better place it will be a better place for everybody " some environmentalists argue that installing a tollway downtown will attract more cars and thus release more emissions in the area but proponents including mayor leppert counter that the tollway will relieve traffic jams downtown by providing a "reliever route " and actually reduce emissions because there will be fewer cars idling in traffic mayor leppert the chairman and chief executive of construction firm turner corp prior to his election in june describes the tollway as the linchpin of the entire trinity river project the mayor says that restricting or eliminating the tollway will make it challenging to gain federal money for planned expansions of highways feeding into downtown because federal authorities wont widen roads with the result of funneling traffic into a bottleneck routing traffic elsewhere in lieu of building the tollway will cost an estimated &# million more for buying properties along the alternate route he says if voters reject the tollway mayor leppert says "then we are going to lose the opportunity to do the trinity project for your generation and mine " corrections &amp amplifications a proposed road between the trinity river and a levee in dallas was envisioned in as an eight lane thoroughfare with a speed limit of miles per hour a marketplace article wednesday incorrectly described the plan as a four lane road with a mph limit wsj nov
