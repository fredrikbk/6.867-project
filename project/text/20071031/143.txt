the mossberg solution when the web becomes the family dinner table site aids kin closeness with postings video working out beta bugs have you ever felt guilty for hearing news about your mother second hand its all too easy to fall out of sync with your family especially when relatives are spread out in different states time zones or countries so it makes sense to use the web to keep in touch and while email has its place as do photo sharing sites and blogs none of these solutions truly knits family members together in an environment where everyone can share post and comment on content much like sitting around the dinner table this week i tested one of the many web sites created specifically to target families myfamily com myfamily is a free site that serves as a place where invited members can upload photos videos news recipes family tree entries and other data in a few steps naturally this idea of helping families stay in touch through a web site is one which many companies are anxious to monopolize sites vying for the spotlight include the likes of famster the family post and mygreatbigfamily com some of these charge monthly or annual fees and offer features like online chatting within the site or ritzy background music while the site is being viewed neither of which are currently included in myfamily myfamilys ace in the hole is its popular relative ancestry com both sites are owned by parent company generations network inc which means that ancestrys wealth of digitally scanned data and genealogy research can be linked to myfamily com enriching the site another big plus for myfamily is that it gives users the chance to add voice recordings to photos these can be used to narrate a slide show called snapgenies or when commenting on a shared image voice comments are added by following on screen instructions and calling a number i enlisted help from seven of my family members to test our own myfamily com site with a little coaching my year old grandfather added a digital photo and an accompanying audio comment to our site my mom supplied images voice comments and text comments and my dad needed only a little time during a busy week to add his voice comments to photos i posted of last years thanksgiving but myfamily com isnt without its flaws the site has been around by name for years however i tested the newest version of this site myfamily com which is still in its beta or test stages and is definitely still working out some of its bugs for example a "whats new" list on the home page should display recent site changes yet unseen by the user but a video that i posted didnt show up here nor did new comments about photos also two of my relatives received error messages when first trying to access the site with my invitation and when a friend of mine added a person family tree to her own site the tree disappeared upon her next visit luckily she found it via an emailed link from the company myfamily cleverly starts new users on a page where they can create a site rather than first asking for a username and password as is done by many sites it works on macs and pcs and on all three major browsers though apples safari browser has a few hiccups for now myfamily com doesnt offer unique urls like www boehretfamily com instead users go to myfamily com and sign in with a username and password the site automatically remembers you when you return so regularly accessing it from the same computer is a cinch the family member who creates the site in this case me is designated the administrator and can invite anyone to become a site member invitees are labeled as either members or guests the former can add content to the web site while the latter can only view and comment on the sites contents administrators can choose from four themes with different colors and patterns and each site is laid out in the same way members listed on the left three advertisements a centered photo and lists of whats new and upcoming events myfamily will introduce themes with more variety in the next few weeks simple tabs running across the top ridge of the page organize the sites content into photos videos discussions snapgenies trees as in family trees events files and people i got started by dragging and dropping batches of digital photos from my hard drive onto the site using a fast uploading tool photos can be listed alone or in virtual albums which organize them a bit better i also added videos to the site and though these took a little longer to load they were as easy to post as my digital photos myfamily coms integration with voice comments is a huge plus for the site i smiled listening to my moms emotional tone in a heartfelt comment that she left with a photo of my cousins st birthday on another photo of two relatives asleep in chairs after thanksgiving dinner my dad left a voice comment in which he joked about how exciting the dinner must have been these comments could easily have been left in text form but by following on screen instructions to call a number enter a pin and leave a message my own family site suddenly became much more personal i also used the phone to create narrated slide shows called snapgenies i spoke into the phone to describe each photo and then skipped to the next image on my computer screen before talking about the next shot when finished i hung up the phone and the result was a simple slide show that anyone in my family could play back with ease the instructions for ending these snapgenies could stand to be a bit clearer but myfamily says it is working on this family trees can be created on the site or uploaded from existing family tree files photos audio and video can be uploaded from your computer to the tree and these trees are shared with family members who can also contribute to them with an ancestry com subscription annual u s searching cost is &# a month users can attach historical census immigration and military records to their trees as well as hints about other people before the end of the year myfamily com users will be able to upload content from a family site directly to the tree my sister posted a couple of items under the discussions tab a recipe for skillet tamale pie in recipes and web sites related to our next family vacation in the news section she asked our whole family to take a look at a list of midvacation excursions to decide which ones we wanted to go on evoking a few responses from the younger members in its current state myfamily doesnt limit the amount of data uploaded to a site though individual file sizes are technically limited videos cant exceed megabytes each and photos cant exceed around megabytes each myfamily plans to offer an ad free subscription model at the start of that will offer more storage the company estimates that this paid model will cost about &# annually email updates are sent to site members daily or weekly to inform them about the sites latest developments improvements are on the horizon for myfamily com including person to person chatting through the site simple photo editing and the ability to create hyperlinks in posts the myfamily com name has years behind it staying power that resonates with families who worry about their tediously entered data disappearing should a web site go belly up to placate old and new site members this version of the site needs to make sure its dependably usable at all times the new version of myfamily com is off to a good start and family members of all ages will feel comfortable here whether browsing the site or adding content of their own edited by walter s mossberg email mossbergsolution wsj com
