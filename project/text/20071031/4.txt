asian demand fuels lng race booming asian demand for liquefied natural gas has two competing multibillion dollar projects racing to export gas from papua new guinea most analysts see a group led by exxon mobil corp as the front runner but the liquid niugini gas project with merrill lynch &amp co s financial backing is confident it can meet its own ambitious development schedule if either is developed it would be the biggest project ever undertaken in papua new guinea papua new guinea has estimated natural gas resources of over trillion cubic feet mostly in the rugged southern highlands the challenge lies in how to best unlock its value by delivering it to a market exxon and its partners which include australias oil search ltd had planned an almost mile gas pipeline to serve eastern australia but with lng prices surging past australian domestic gas prices and pipeline construction costs soaring the partners abandoned the plan in february in favor of an lng project "our view is that an lng development currently offers the best opportunity to maximize value for all stakeholders from the commercialization of papua new guineas natural gas resource " exxon mobil spokesman rob young says the consortium may build a plant able to produce between five million and million metric tons of lng a year oil search has said a plant to make million tons a year would cost &# billion with the upstream and pipeline component costing &# billion and the processing plant &# billion the company says early technical work is on track to let the partners start front end engineering and design by late or early with marketing of the gas expected to start soon after oil search managing director peter botten said customer interest the project will be strong he pointed to two deals last month in which petrochina co moved to secure gas from australian lng developments "the entry of chinese buyers back into the lng market in september and other positive developments augur well for the lng market generally and suggest that demand and pricing will remain strong for the foreseeable future " mr botten said the china deals are likely to prompt traditional lng customers including japan and south korea and potential new buyers such as india to step up their searches for new supplies setting the scene for them to battle it out and bid prices higher a large delegation from major japanese energy companies recently visited papua new guinea to explore gas opportunities some investors mark down companies operating in papua new guinea for the potential risks but mr botten says that the newly re elected government is giving strong backing to the exxon mobil project and that talks on fiscal arrangements are progressing well some of the engineering work for the abandoned pipeline plan can be applied to the lng project giving the exxon group a head start but its important advantage is the huge trillion cubic feet of gas reserves it has in the southern highlands four trillion cubic feet is commonly accepted as adequate to underpin a single lng processing train liquid niugini gas expects to spend between &# billion and &# billion on its own plans for an lng project that would produce nine million to million tons a year but the group has yet to firm up the gas reserves that will underpin it merrill lynch has taken a major stake in the project and will market the gas on behalf of the other partners liquid niugini is owned by merrill lynch canadas interoil corp and energy investor pacific lng with each holding equal one third stakes the partners aim to deliver the first lng from papua new guinea by most lng projects are developed step by step with companies securing access to land followed by gas supply engineering work marketing and final investment decision and then construction liquid niugini chief executive jack hamilton a former woodside petroleum ltd executive aims to have many of those steps carried out simultaneously many australian energy analysts are skeptical about the chances of the project meeting its output date target "we started this strategy in july last year and so far over the first months into the journey we are holding all the elements together " mr hamilton says he points out that the parallel fast track development approach has been successfully employed by marathon oil corp in equatorial guinea and is being used by woodside in its billion australian dollar us&# billion pluto development in western australia developing two lng projects in papua new guinea at the same time would pressure the countrys infrastructure and one analyst from a major international brokerage said only one project is likely to go ahead "one or the other will go ahead and i would be backing the exxon mobil png lng project of all the projects in the region that is the most likely to go ahead next " he said oil searchs mr botten has said he doesnt see any impact from the rival project and liquid niuginis mr hamilton said he doesnt believe the two are competing "we have separate gas fields supported by separate facilities " mr hamilton said interoil which operates an oil refinery in papua new guinea is working to prove the gas reserves needed to underpin the liquid niugini project its elk and antelope fields may hold between and trillion cubic feet of gas and drilling is under way to confirm just how big they are if the reserves are less than expected the partners believe they can still source gas from other gas holders mr hamilton said results so far are encouraging and show the field should underpin at least one processing train "for the first train everything we have seen so far continues to support it continues to give confidence to all three shareholders to continue to invest and support the fast track strategy " he said liquid niugini like exxon mobil aims to begin engineering and design work by the end of
