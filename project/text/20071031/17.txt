business bookshelf the apple of his ibook options by fake steve jobs aka daniel lyons da capo pages &# it is and steve jobs is one hurdle away from finishing his ultimate invention the iphone but whenever the apple chief tries to focus on removing the iphones final imperfection he is interrupted staffers barge in to yak about stock options backdating criminal investigations and blah blah blah mwah mwah jobs can and does sack employees who talk out of turn and right now hes firing people as fast as he can but he cant fire the ambitious prosecutor bent on jailing him and as he once learned the hard way if things get bad enough apple can fire steve jobs this isnt the real steven p jobs its the cruelly funny "fake steve" created by writer daniel lyons a senior editor at forbes mr lyons began covertly blogging "the secret diary of steve jobs" last year playing on mr jobss reputation as conceited quick tempered and implacable not to mention his godlike status among techies mr lyons as fake steve posted foul mouthed first person rants about apples customers its competitors and mr lyonss fellow journalists who cover silicon valley when a disillusioned apple customer sledgehammered his macbook on video fake steve mocked him "your word against ours frigtard " of al gore and computer scientist bill joy he blogged "theyre all running around like idiots on this global warming thing like um folks how do you get up to the top of aspen to ski call me back for a donation when youve taken out all the lifts sold your suvs and returned the village to candlelight " mr lyons was outed in august but forbess management encouraged him to keep up the act "options" expands fake steves monologues from blog post to novel length the setup is mr jobss real life run in last year with california prosecutors who claimed that he had backdated stock options to increase their value in the book fake steve cant even remember the options grant he doesnt understand finances at all a lone self absorbed obsessive who wants only to perfect his gadgets he tunes out anyone who tries to explain the details of the scandal he is more troubled by minute flaws in the rooms furniture with &# billion in the bank hes eager to pay a fine and be left alone with his iphone but the threat of prison cracks his delusion of invulnerability the head of the legal department warns him of the potential trouble he faces and fake steve reflects "thats a strange word incarceration and after she says it a weird silence comes over the room suddenly the air feels really really cold and its so quiet that i can hear the air conditioning whirring in the walls and im thinking to myself holy friggin mother of jesus i am so going to kill the a holes who did the hvac work in this place " the authors clever strategy is to make fake steve as naive as most readers about the complexities of business stocks and the law so "options" never bores us by trying to explain them the gray rules around stock options are complex but anyone can grasp the simple symmetrical beauty of an ipod fake steve has a preternatural sense of such aesthetics and like clark kents superman powers fake steves aesthetic sense doesnt have an on off switch "you cant imagine how many shades of black there are " he moans "and white " if the companys white delivery trucks dont exactly match the white loading dock he cant concentrate more firings ensue stretching a blog to a novel sounds like a formula for failure akin to turning an al franken sketch on "saturday night live" into "stuart saves his family " but "options" works because mr lyonss comic voice never lets up theres a laugh out loud moment on nearly each one of the books pages mr jobss celebrity friends are ruthlessly satirized bono never carries cash because jesus didnt he says but really so he never has to pay for anything hillary clinton drags a helpless bill behind her and spews a blue streak at donation wary valley moguls fake steve picks up a call from london thinking it might be paul mccartney wanting to discuss allowing the sale of beatles music on itunes but instead its richard branson phoning from feet up in a hot air balloon proposing "ipod class" seating on virgin atlantic fake steve asks what the ipod connection would be "hrm well " fake branson replies "uh yah whatever who knows but its marketing innit " most important mr lyons gradually transforms fake steve from an imperious dolt into a tortured loner still traumatized that his birth mother put him up for adoption the real mr jobs was an adopted child if he is kicked out of apple a second time he has failed to prove his worth to her despite fake steves inner journey the laughs keep coming mostly because he remains as sociopathic as ever from between the plot lines of "options" bubbles a raw honest look at silicon valley culture low rent billionaires pretentious new money moguls and "frenemy" competitors who have no one to talk to but each other mr lyons posits mr jobs as the bridge between the valleys geeky two guys in a garage past and its future as purveyor of consumer fetish brands refreshingly the internet barely figures into the story the books finale alas doesnt live up to what has gone before to thwart the malignant prosecutor fake steve makes an improbable left turn that lacks the aura of credibility that makes his earlier antics so intoxicating still "options" rushes from start to finish like a crazy maze of falling dominoes that just keep going and going and going its only a minor disappointment when the last couple of blocks fall astray fake steves ruthless inner monologues about those around him ring truer than most nonfiction profiles of techs movers and shakers by inserting himself into steve jobss mythical oversize shoes mr lyons has exposed the entertaining humanity behind the machines mr boutin is a silicon valley based writer for slate and valleywag
