taxpayers find ways to lessen amts impact advisers push new strategies as congress again debates ultimate fate of feared tax the scariest thing about this time of year isnt halloween its the chance that youll get ensnared by the alternative minimum tax and wind up owing thousands of additional dollars in taxes even though congress is considering killing the tax and house ways and means chairman charles rangel d n y proposed legislation last week that would do just that no one expects the amt to disappear anytime soon instead legislators are likely to keep the tax from expanding significantly if at all while putting off its ultimate fate until after the presidential elections if they fail to do anything millions more people will find themselves hit by the tax for taxpayers for their part are increasingly factoring in the amt when devising their year end tax planning strategies some of these tactics are counterintuitive and require taxpayers to turn conventional wisdom on its head for example the typical year end advice for most taxpayers includes accelerating deductions into the current year whenever possible but some people caught by the amt may benefit by doing just the opposite deferring certain deductions into if youre in the amt this year but may not be next year consider delaying payment of fourth quarter state and local taxes until when they might be deductible those most likely to benefit from such strategies are people who are fairly certain theyll be ensnared by the amt this year or next year but not both years an example would be someone moving from a high tax area such as new york city to a state that doesnt have a state income tax such as florida texas or nevada or vice versa other examples include someone whose income may surge or shrink from one year to the next because of retirement loss of a job marriage divorce or other factors planning around the amt a parallel tax system set up to ensure that everyone pays some tax can be exceptionally difficult especially since nobody knows exactly what the law will look like for or in many cases there is little or nothing one can do those most likely to be affected by the amt make between &# and &# and live in high tax areas since state and local taxes arent deductible under the amt among those who have benefited from some advance planning are martha markusen of duluth minn and her husband greg smith in when the couples combined income pushed them into the amt they deferred paying estimated state income taxes and property taxes until january because they didnt end up in the amt for they were able to take advantage of the deductions she estimates the tax savings amounted to several thousand dollars this year ms markusen went into full time retirement and she thinks its likely the family will be able to stay out of the amt but she says theres a "good chance" theyll be back in it again next year thus she and her husband are planning to take as many deductions as possible for that includes prepaying some of their property taxes this year so that they dont lose the deduction next year financial planners and accountants say they are increasingly recommending similar tactics to minimize the amts tax bite "for people on the border of the amt the focus really becomes shifting anything that would not be deductible for amt purposes into a non amt year " says michael kitces director of financial planning for pinnacle advisory group inc in columbia md in recent years mitchell zachary a tax partner at grassi &amp co in lake success n y has been advising clients who are likely to be in the amt to pay their real estate and state income taxes in the following calendar year many people pay their fourth quarter state taxes in december to get the tax benefits sooner even though they may have until mid january of the following year to pay them he says "but if youre in the amt youve cheated yourself out of the benefit of doing that " mr zachary has been advising one of his longtime clients jeffrey greenfield of rockville centre n y to defer paying his state income taxes to the following year "we review it every year in early december and work out which year he should pay those taxes " mr zachary says "if i know for sure that hes not going to get the benefit of paying the taxes in we defer it until in the hopes that due to some other events such as fluctuations in his income he wont be in the amt " mr greenfield a year old independent insurance agent says "years ago i used to pay my taxes in december because it made business sense to take the deduction now i wait until jan " even though he has gotten hit with the amt for each of the past five years he figures that theres always the chance that he may escape the amt the following year which would give him the chance to use the deduction "every year i keep hoping against hope that congress will do something to fix the tax " mr greenfield says some taxpayers may even want to consider accelerating income into the current tax year if they know theyre going to be subject to the amt however this can get so complicated that it might be best to consult a tax expert or use a software program if youre interested in investing in tax exempt municipal bonds do some homework before you make the leap warns robin christian senior tax analyst at thomson tax &amp accounting many "tax exempt" bonds arent really tax free she notes they pay interest that is subject to the amt according to the securities industry and financial markets association there were about &# billion of these so called amt bonds outstanding as of the end of the third quarter this year about of the &# trillion of municipal securities outstanding many more people will be facing these and other quandaries if congress doesnt take action soon to prevent the amt from ensnaring new victims if lawmakers do nothing the number of people hit by the amt will soar to about million for from about four million for according to treasury department estimates just how big a hit would this mean for taxpayers that depends on their individual circumstances but treasury secretary henry paulson said last week these million people would pay on average an additional &# in federal income tax time is running short for congress to act the internal revenue service needs to send mountains of tax material for the tax year to the publisher within a few weeks and it will have to make numerous computer programming adjustments to reflect any last minute congressional changes "to avoid confusion and delays for taxpayers it is critical" that an amt stopgap measure be enacted by early november mr paulson said he said enactment of a patch beyond early november "could also significantly delay processing" of taxpayer returns and payment of refunds moreover delaying action on the amt issue until mid november or later "will create significant challenges" for the irs and "poses an extremely high risk" to the tax filing season the treasury secretary said "it will also create significant compliance challenges and will result in confusion for taxpayers tax return preparers and tax software developers " the legislation introduced by rep rangel includes permanent repeal of the amt for individuals the bill also has a stopgap measure that includes higher amt exemption levels but only for one year this proposal is estimated to cost nearly &# billion over years its unclear what the final legislation will look like as house and senate leaders wrangle over details but "the most likely outcome at this point is another one year patch " says clint stretch managing principal of tax policy at deloitte tax llp in washington at stake are large amounts of money for millions of people deloitte analysts have come up with a few examples of how the proposed "amt patch " which includes raising amt exemption levels would if enacted affect some hypothetical taxpayers for example a single person with &# of household income would save about
