business world unimpressiv with the holidays approaching a wall street colleague may sidle up and suggest a contribution to the siv superfund your esoteric reading is likely to lead you astray here this is not a campaign to cure the simian immunodeficiency virus a subject that recently occupied you for hours on wikipedia its a self help bailout fund organized by banks for their friendly neighborhood "structured investment vehicles " heres your crib sheet to save you from gaping like a gaffed striper or worse reaching mechanically for your wallet to cover up embarrassment at not having a clue what your colleague is talking about lets start with an analogy suppose mastercard was no longer willing to roll over the purchase of that new boat in your garage youd have to sell the boat but the market is not keen on boats right now even nice boats youd have to take a big loss sivs are free standing investment companies that own a lot of boats really mortgage securities and other asset backed loans in various states of seaworthiness which have lately become difficult to sell or refinance amid the subprime credit crunch ergo a group of banks wants to raise money for a &# billion fund to float a "new" siv to buy the nice boats so the existing sivs wont have to dump them on the market at fire sale prices the goal the banks say is to restore market confidence in nice boats so eventually sivs will be able to raise money on their own some also mutter darkly about "systemic risk" to the financial markets not absent of course is the suspicion that the banks own a lot of boats too and are trying to protect their own capital and profits what to do the appeal is being led by impressive names citigroup jp morgan bank of america should you contribute your money and your clients money in hopes of doing well by doing good here are some more crib notes the good this is a voluntary bailout not a mandatory one if banks want to raise money to warehouse good boats until their value recovers who cares why theyre doing it or what their self interest is what matters is whether it offers a good return on your money the bad you have nothing against treasury secretary hank paulson hes handsome dashing and a towering financial genius of our time but if this is a private effort why has he been front and center in organizing it and selling it he says the goal is not to bail out citigroup or anyone else or to help banks hide badly performing loans behind a fresh coat of paint but simply to speed the return of confidence and liquidity to the market for high quality boats "i cant say this strongly enough with this aaa rated paper the highest rated paper most of the issues were dealing with here are not credit issues ok most of them are liquidity issues and the mortgages that are backing up that paper are high quality mortgages " thanks for the soft sell hank you notice that a british boat owner er bank northern rock recently suffered a bank run after signs the government was worried about its solvency is citigroup our northern rock maybe instead of investing in a "super" siv you should be stocking up on krugerrands and canned soup your skepticism is exacerbated by claims that wall streets once lucrative siv sideline must be resurrected because it performs a useful role in the economy if sivs in the future can place profitable sound credits in front of lenders wouldnt lenders beat down their doors without any heroics today the ugly banks are supposed to know better than to borrow short and lend long which can be profitable as heck until short term rates skyrocket or short term lenders disappear altogether no banks didnt commit this folly directly they set up off balance sheet sivs to borrow short and lend long while shifting some of the proceeds back to the bank sponsors as fat "fees " citigroup for one collected &# million last year from its biggest siv equivalent to about of the profits funneled to outside investors but werent the outside investors supposed to bear any loss otherwise the banks were obliged to recognize the sivs on their own balance sheets with suitable reserves yet now you hear murmurs that banks offered informal guarantees and staked their "reputational capital" to lure investor cash into the sivs some say that contributing to the superfund would be contributing to "moral hazard " i e encouraging bad behavior a bit of bumf came across your desk recently from economist donald luskin who says that though some banks may be in trouble "other investment banks such as goldman sachs have thrived on the recent chaos and have emerged in superior competitive positions poised to accelerate their profit growth were seeing not the impairment of a sector but rather the realignment of the competitive landscape which is usually a healthy thing " he makes a valid point if contributing to the superfund were a patriotic and profitable duty to help protect the broader economy thats one thing but contributing just to save a few banks from having to own up to their slippery dealings with a few sivs
