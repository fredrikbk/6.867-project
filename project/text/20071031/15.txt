bushs north korea meltdown facts about israels sept raid on a suspected nuclear facility in syria continue to emerge albeit still incompletely especially regarding the involvement of the democratic peoples republic of north korea important questions remain such as whether its personnel were present when the attack occurred and whether they had been working to clone the yongbyon nuclear facility in the syrian desert since the north korean commitment in february the latest in a long series to give up its nuclear programs seemingly unperturbed however the bush administration apparently believes north korea is serious this time unlike all the others the concessions continue to flow in essentially only one direction crossing repeated "red lines" washington had drawn these include the humiliating u s collapse on north koreas access to international financial markets accepting a mere "freeze" of yongbyon misleadingly called "disablement" by the administration rather than real dismantlement failing to ensure enforcement of u n security council resolution s sanctions imposed after pyongyangs nuclear test and the state departments palpable hunger to remove north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and the trading with the enemy acts prohibitions and re establish full diplomatic relations the bush administrations most serious concession is forthcoming in which the u s will accept with little or no concrete verification pyongyangs imminent declaration that it actually has very little nuclear activity other than what we have long known about at yongbyon even critics from the left now worry that state is conceding far more than it should jack pritchard the special envoy for negotiations with north korea who resigned during secretary of state colin powells tenure because our policy was too unyielding said recently that north korean officials think "they can ask for and get what they want from the bush administration because it is so eager to demonstrate a diplomatic achievement " mr pritchard concluded "the north koreans are rubbing their hands together with glee " our current secretary of state condoleezza rice and other partisans of the six party talks respond to all internal administration complaints or criticisms by asking "what is your alternative what would you have us do otherwise risk war on the peninsula " herewith some responses first it is simply inapposite to judge every tactical decision to accede or stand firm on this or that subsidiary point by forecasting the complete demise of the entire six party process if north korean sensibilities are ruffled by occasionally saying "no " indeed showing tactical toughness can frequently enhance the long term prospects for success not reduce them sadly however toughness at the tactical or strategic level is no longer the hallmark of our north korea policy weakness is the watchword second before it is too late president bush has to draw a deep line in the sand on verification the state department has yet to say anything publicly about how verification will be accomplished especially on the norths uranium enrichment efforts giving rise to the suspicion that our negotiators dont really have a clue what they mean the idea of north korea for years engaged in cloning yongbyon in syria or anywhere else burma for instance should be a fire bell in the night president reagans mantra of "trust but verify" in the cold war days didnt offend anyone and if it offends kim jong il that should tell us something if anything however with north korea president bush should reverse reagans order lets see real verification and leave trust until later third consider the severely negative effect these repeated concessions have on our relations with japan and south korea president bush used to stress that this was a "six party" process but now all of the action is bilateral the state departments lust to remove north korea from the terrorism list is having a profoundly negative impact on our treaty ally japan the nation most directly threatened by pyongyangs nuclear capability thomas schieffer the bush administrations ambassador to japan reportedly complained recently to the president that he was "cut out of the process " state should explain why it trusts north korea more than our ambassador to tokyo and why we ignore tokyos concerns over north koreas kidnappings of japanese citizens south korea is facing a critical presidential election in december the last thing washington should do is pursue concessionary policies that might enhance the prospects for a new president who follows the same appeasement line as incumbent president roh moo hyun if south korea can discard mr rohs rose colored glasses our overall prospects will improve considerably but our unquestioning embrace of north korea could have exactly the wrong impact in the souths volatile politics fourth and most importantly the right response to the north korean threat is to apply pressure steadily and consistently rather than hastily releasing it after its nuclear test pyongyang faced growing pressure from the cumulative impact of chinese anger u n security council sanctions ongoing implementation of the proliferation security initiative psi and the u s treasurys continuing financial squeeze there was a plan of sorts and it was producing some evidence of success instead of squeezing harder such as by encouraging refugee flows out of the north the administration did a u turn it let a desperate north korea up off the mat provided tangible economic support for this appallingly authoritarian regime allowed kim jong il to relegitimize himself and undercut the psi world wide the icing on kims cake is that for years before during and after the and "agreements" north korea was happily violating its commitments instead of focusing china on solving the problem of the regime it has propped up for so long we absolved china sidelined japan inserted ourselves and started life support for the administrators of the worlds largest prison camp this will perpetuate the north korean problem not solve it any by perpetuating kim jong ils regime and its continuing threat it is actually the state departments policy that poses the greater risk to international peace and security this is true not only for pyongyang but for other would be proliferators watching our ongoing failure to stop north korea the debate within the bush administration is not yet over although time is short before irreparable harm is done growing restiveness in congress among republicans and democrats may increasingly become a factor for president bush i can only hope he re reads his first term speeches on north korea mr bolton a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute is the author of "surrender is not an option defending america at the united nations " out next week from simon &amp schuster threshold editions
