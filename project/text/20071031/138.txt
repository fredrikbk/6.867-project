the evening wrap after the cut online edition federal reserve policy makers today delivered the interest rate cut that many on wall street had predicted but their even handed take on inflation and growth risks had economists guessing as to what might come next just after p m the federal open market committee announced that it had lowered its target for the federal funds rate by a quarter point to since just such a snip was considered a given by many traders and investors those who make a living by trying to read the minds of fed policy makers quickly turned to the statement that accompanies the feds decision in its usual bone dry prose the fomc commented anew on its twin economic fears inflation and slowing growth growth the statement said "will likely slow in the near term partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction " this seemed to proffer the possibility of future rate cuts to keep the economy rolling but not so fast the very next paragraph invoked the bogeyman of inflation saying "recent increases in energy and commodity prices among other factors may put renewed upward pressure on inflation " which has had some modest readings of late so whats an economist to do with such two handed assessments some zeroed in on the following fomc statement "the committee judges that after this action the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth " and from it they deduced that a cascade of rate cuts may not be in the cards but mfr economist joshua shapiro for one looked past that somewhat hawkish statement on inflation "looking ahead if growth slows as much as we believe likely there will be considerable pressure on the fomc to ease further whether they move again in december is uncertain but at this stage we do think that the odds favor a bit more easing before this cycle is through " speaking of cycles lehman brothers economists noted the feds reference to "todays action combined with the policy action taken in september " as likely working to blunt the economic impact of credit market turmoil that could mean that the end of cutting has come they suggested since "more generally when the fomc discusses rate moves in cumulative terms they are coming to or at the end of whatever cycle they had been in " they also said the vote against todays cut from kansas city federal reserve bank president thomas hoenig might indicate some wavering by other policy makers "further fomc rate cuts unless driven by an obvious compelling economic need seem unlikely " the lehman economists wrote
