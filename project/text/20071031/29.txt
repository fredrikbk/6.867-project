common sense merrills board needed to question success smartmoney the merrill lynch board deserves credit for its swift ouster of chairman and chief executive officer stan oneal the flip side of high executive compensation must be accountability mr oneal was well paid with an exit package estimated at more than &# million he will leave merrill a wealthy man his rise from poverty in the deep south is inspiring and he deserves credit for his many successes but as ceo hes responsible for merrills stunning &# billion write down of assets last week and even more for the collapse of investor confidence and resulting plunge in merrills stock price from a high of &# to this weeks mid &# s if more boards moved as decisively there would be less revulsion toward the exorbitant pay packages that so often seem disconnected from performance still i have concerns and questions merrills board was packed with people picked by mr oneal and he was reportedly someone who resisted constructive criticism and stifled genuine debate in this he resembles plenty of chief executives and theres nothing in sarbanes oxley to prevent it but its not good governance or effective leadership as a result mr oneal and his board may have failed to engage in the kind of debate that would have prevented this tragedy to be specific what was merrills board asking mr oneal when merrill was earning record profits on the outsize success of its huge investment in subprime mortgages and related collateralized debt and loan obligations i know its hard to ask tough questions in the face of success its not a strategy for winning popularity contests but its essential in the worlds of business and investing as an investor i worry nearly as much about outsize gains as i do about losses extreme outperformance makes me nervous thats because reward is correlated with risk you cant earn massive returns without assuming tremendous risk we now know that was true for merrill amid the big gains in its fixed income operations it was assuming far more risk than anyone there apparently realized i have heard the siren song promising high returns with minimal risk as long as ive been investing twenty years ago it was michael milken and the refrain of junk bonds backed by impressive academic research purporting that junk bonds were underpriced given their risk profile the junk bond market collapsed in hedge fund long term capital management purported to have discovered pricing anomalies that raised returns while minimizing risk recently it has been the same with collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations even subprime loans could be packaged into "tranches" so unlikely to default that they merited triple a credit ratings once again high returns minimal risk today it is gospel that diversifying into so called alternative assets such as hedge funds will produce higher risk adjusted rates of return notwithstanding periodic academic studies to the contrary even accompanied by nobel prizes history has repeatedly demonstrated that there are no high returns without commensurate risk mr oneal was also reportedly obsessed with rival goldman sachss stellar earnings in light of goldmans recent strong performance and the disaster at merrill he must really be scratching his head but based on my conversations with various goldman executives over the years the explanation for goldmans success at least in part is that the firm has a culture that understands the relationship between risk and return thats one reason i feel comfortable owning goldman shares and didnt own merrills theres a lesson for all of us here we tend to focus on our mistakes when our investments soar we tend to think of ourselves as brilliant heres my advice examine your portfolio for your top performing positions do you understand why theyve done so well do their current valuations suggest a higher level of risk are you aware of this risk and do you feel comfortable with it if not consider taking some profits and rebalancing dont end up with your own equivalent of merrills &# billion loss james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com commonsense
