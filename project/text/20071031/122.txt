running a business drop shipping can relieve inventory headaches online edition from smsmallbiz com when judy and ronald smelser of arvada colo started selling items on ebay two years ago their business was a far cry from the well trafficked "power seller" ebay store that it is today at first selling stuff online was simply a novelty says judy "we sold things wed find at garage sales" or even around the house she says but after a year and once judy discovered that she would soon lose her offline job she began to focus her attention online without knowing who to buy from or even what to sell she says sales stalled after some initial research which included internet searches contacting wholesalers and paying attention to late night infomercials judy learned of an increasingly popular technique known as drop shipping drop shipping which is the delivery of merchandise from a supplier directly to a retail stores customer seemed to solve the couples sellers dilemma theyd no longer have to figure out where to keep inventory or contend with packaging and shipping costs now whenever the smelsers receive an order for anything from motorcycle jackets and chaps to bedding which they generally dont keep in stock they receive a customers payment instantly then they order the requested item from the corresponding drop shipper which ships the item directly to the customer from the profit between the wholesale cost of the product and its retail price the smelsers pay ebay a fee and a drop ship fee that can range between cents and &# to &# on top of shipping and handling costs while maintaining a scant inventory the smelsers sell to drop shipped items each day and capture roughly &# in sales each week via their ebay store which has since branched out into its own online business has gotten so busy says ronald "wed like to taper it back some " but even as opting to have products drop shipped has many benefits &lt mdash&gt namely lower costs for stocking packaging and shipping inventory &lt mdash&gt the method is not without its drawbacks for instance "you are at everyone elses mercy " says ronald suppliers may run out of certain products and returns can be a headache drop ship fees can be pricey and theres typically no discount for buying in bulk about drop shipping drop shipping which was first popularized by amazon com and other large scale multichannel retailers used to be off limits to small businesses says jeremy hanks co author of "drop shipping for dummies " thats changed as small businesses have gained greater web footing and captured more customers now like large retailers theyre telling suppliers "why cant you ship it directly to my customers " says hanks who also co founded doba an orem utah software firm that matches retailers to drop shippers in when gi goodall first started looking for wholesalers willing to showcase their items online the lack of enthusiasm was discouraging he says but after he persisted and found some takers he says "lo and behold products started selling " and once he launched a more professional site dealzreal com in goodall began working exclusively with three drop shippers today he works with about different suppliers plus doba which connects him to about others and the site features about items of which about are drop shipped directly to customers these days he says "its easier to get a supplier to drop ship items when you are a small internet company " combating obstacles to be sure there are still obstacles and one thing goodall has learned is "dont compete on price " bigger retailers who can buy in bulk and pass on discounts to customers will undercut you every time he says and the web being a comparison shoppers paradise is an even worse turf to compete on price for that reason he says "electronics are very difficult to sell " separate yourself by some other means the smelsers for example pride themselves on their excellent customer feedback score on ebay at nearly positive customer reviews and no negative responses ronald says "you can charge &# higher on an item if a customer can trust that theyll get good service " or "find specialty products and a niche rather than compete on price " says hanks just make sure theres a market for those products he says for example you might be able to find a wholesaler to drop ship ceramic baskets but if customers arent interested they wont sell once youve found wholesalers to work with figure out ahead of time how youll deal with back orders and returns to combat getting hung up by drop shippers suddenly running out of products and having to backorder items the smelsers try to keep one of just about everything they sell in stock "there is nothing more frustrating than a drop shipper saying we dont have any" of whatever item you need in stock says ronald its also possible to run into drop shippers that will change prices on you says goodall if backorders and price changes become frequent cease working with the drop shipper to cut down on this back and forth some retailers have opted to work with companies that research wholesalers one is worldwide brands which sells a directory of drop shippers lastly and most importantly work with only reputable drop shippers "as soon as you make things virtual you open the door up for the bad guys " says hanks drop shipping scams of recent years include sham drop shipper lists shipments of poor quality products or no shipments at all and middlemen pretending to be wholesalers who instead jack up prices to protect yourself says hanks do as much research on prospective wholesalers as possible make sure a drop shipper has a web site or ask the company to mail you a catalog also check and see if they are a member of the better business bureau find out the location of the drop shippers warehouse and go on a tour if its near you another way to find reputable suppliers is to go to trade shows says hanks "if someone has a booth there they are legitimate " he says "starting up " a weekly column written by diana ransom for smsmallbiz com follows entrepreneurs through the early stages of launching a business
