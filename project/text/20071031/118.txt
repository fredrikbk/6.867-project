politics &amp economics why oil may not stop at &# as reservoirs age and demand grows prices may go even higher london oil at &# a barrel that may not be the worst of it several leading oil experts gathered here yesterday for an annual energy conference sketched a near term future in which mounting global demand and shrinking supplies push oil prices well past the &# a barrel mark consuming countries they argued will simply have to deal with the fact that new pockets of oil are getting far harder and more expensive to tap that combined with years of underinvestment by the industry has led to a tapering off of new oil supplies that will continue for years despite rising energy demand in asia the middle east and some industrialized countries yet on a day when u s benchmark oil prices retreated from mondays record closing down &# a barrel or to &# on the new york mercantile exchange two ministers from the organization of petroleum exporting countries at the same gathering insisted that the immediate problem isnt too little oil prices have jumped nearly since early summer the oil ministers of qatar and the united arab emirates said because of the slumping dollar widespread wall street speculation and bottlenecks in the refining process "please dont blame us" for record oil prices said abdullah al attiyah qatars minister of oil expressing a sentiment that is widely held among major oil producing countries "you have blamed us for years " the debate over what is driving the surge in oil prices is sure to get more spirited if prices continue to soar and oil executives consumers and politicians seek to assign blame but the feuding theories at this years oil &amp money conference also show how hard it is to pinpoint a cause sadad i al husseini an oil consultant and former executive at aramco saudi arabias national oil company gave a particularly chilling assessment of the worlds oil outlook the major oil producing nations he said are inflating their oil reserves by as much as billion barrels these amount to hypothetical reserves that are "not delineated not accessible and not available for production " a lot of production in the middle east is from mature reservoirs and the giant fields of the persian gulf region he said are depleted global oil and gas capacity is constrained by mature reservoirs and is facing a " year production plateau " mr husseini said he predicted that supply shortages will continue to add &# to the price of oil for every million barrels a day in additional demand global demand now at some million barrels a day was on average million barrels a day lower in nobuo tanaka the new executive director of the paris based international energy agency which is funded by the worlds leading industrialized consumer nations said he sees little likelihood the worlds spare capacity for oil production will increase notably in the near future partly because so many oil rich countries continue to shun outside investors "the iea says that despite the high oil price market tightness will increase from because new capacity additions wont keep up with reduced capacity from existing fields " he said iea analysts insist that a sufficient resource base exists to supply demand through but mr tanaka said he isnt confident there will be enough investment skilled workers and technology to actually get to that oil "in a timely manner " andrew gould the chairman and chief executive of schlumberger ltd an oil services company expressed similar concerns noting that of the oil fields that now quench world demand are more than years old the growth in global demand since he said has been roughly the equivalent of the daily output from two of the worlds larger suppliers the north sea and mexico "our industry simply cannot cope with these kinds of increases " mr gould told the assembly opec countries supply about of world production but that slice is expected to increase in coming years as output decreases in non opec countries such as mexico and russia saudi arabia the worlds largest single supplier is looking to increase production substantially into the next decade but with oil prices now flirting with &# a barrel opec officials have been aggressive in batting aside talk that they are to blame "the market is increasingly driven by forces beyond opecs control by geopolitical events and the growing influence of financial investors " said mohammed bin dhaen al hamli the united arab emirates oil minister who also serves as opecs president mr hamli said prices still are "far below" the all time inflation adjusted high of &# a barrel set in the spring of after the iranian revolution shocked oil markets his qatari counterpart mr al attiyah noted that gold prices also have been skyrocketing "why are people concentrating on oil and closing their eyes on gold " he asked adding later that he is "fed up" with people blaming opec for fluctuations in oil prices both ministers said the cartel wont formally consider whether to increase supplies to the world market during a heads of state meeting in saudi arabia next month the group agreed last month to add about barrels a day to world production effective nov a top official at the energy department disputed opecs claim that supply isnt an immediate challenge "we think the market still needs more barrels as we look toward the next year or so " said guy caruso an administrator at the departments energy information administration "the problem is we dont have cushions " in terms of spare production capacity and spare crude stocks he said "we have relatively low and declining inventories and a refining sector thats finding it hard to get the crude it needs "
