spicy or mild when etfs are better than index funds join me on the fence investors are voting with their dollars favoring exchange traded index funds over index mutual funds i think theyre making a mistake my contention the best strategy is to own both use index mutual funds for accounts youre regularly adding to or drawing on while stashing longer term money in exchange traded index funds that combo should trim your investment costs and further boost your fund returns counting costs stock index mutual funds which you can purchase directly from the parent fund company still have more assets than etfs which you have to buy through a full service or discount broker but growth rates tell another story since year end assets in index mutual funds have climbed but much of this increase can be explained by market appreciation by contrast etf assets have soared as investors overwhelmingly favor these funds with their new investment dollars to be sure etfs offer a fistful of advantages they often have lower annual expenses than comparable mutual funds they should be more tax efficient theres huge variety with etfs available that track indexes both well known and obscure and because they are listed on the stock market you can trade them throughout the day indeed etfs are a favorite of traders and those aiming to make focused investment bets got a thing for swedish stocks theres an etf for you on the other hand if youre like me and looking to sock away money regularly in a diversified index fund portfolio etfs often dont make sense the problem with every trade you pay a brokerage commission and lose a little to the bid ask spread the slight difference between an etfs selling share price and its higher purchase price those trading costs mean etfs usually arent economical for anyone putting away &# or &# at a time splitting up suppose however that after regularly salting away that &# or &# your index mutual fund accounts are now worth &# one possibility move a chunk of that money into etfs to take advantage of their lower expenses meanwhile for your monthly savings continue to use index mutual funds so you dont rack up big trading costs similarly if you are retired and drawing down your accounts keep money you will need soon in index mutual funds while stashing long term savings in etfs lets say you own a mutual fund like vanguard reit index a real estate fund that charges of assets in annual expenses you could reduce your expenses to by swapping into vanguard reit etf a good move if you use a discount broker you should come out ahead with the etf if you invest &# and sit tight for at least four or five years dodging potholes all this comes with three caveats first consider taxes moving into an etf wont have any tax bite if you trade within a retirement account but if you hold index mutual funds in a taxable account the swap could trigger capital gains taxes second some index mutual funds charge a &# or &# annual account fee if your balance is below &# to avoid that fee keep a minimum of &# in each index mutual fund third dont assume etfs will always be cheaper even if you have a long time horizon and a big chunk to invest for instance in fidelity investments slashed expenses to on four stock index mutual funds geared toward ordinary investors these four funds which have &# minimums track major indexes like the standard &amp poors and the dow jones wilshire expenses were also reduced to on a fifth fund but that fund is aimed at institutions and retirement plans true there are a few etfs that have annual expenses that are slightly below fidelitys but the cost savings is so tiny that it would be tough to beat the fidelity index funds once you figure in etf trading costs moreover if you have &# in one of these fidelity index funds the expenses drop even further to vanguard group also offers ultra cheap mutual funds these vanguard funds are open to folks with &# invested or alternatively those with &# in an account thats been open years
