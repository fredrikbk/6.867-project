a bright picture at canon was exchange rate hit overdone canon inc is on track to post another record profit this year but that hasnt stopped its shares from falling to near year low levels in recent months that is because the company which takes in three quarters of its sales overseas is one of japans biggest exporters in this position it is more vulnerable than most japanese companies to fluctuating exchange rates and a slowing u s economy when global markets were shaken by the u s subprime lending crisis in august canons share price was one of the hardest hit on aug the shares slid to yen &# at current rates each yesterday the stock fell yen or to yen that is down from its recent closing high of yen on sept analysts nonetheless continue to be optimistic about canons future many expect it to outperform the rest of the japanese market over the next year and month price targets reach as high as nearly yen "we think the shares are oversold " goldman sachs analyst shin horie wrote in a note last week his month price target is yen the biggest reason for the bullish outlook is the companys strong performance canon last week affirmed its net profit forecast of billion yen which would be the companys eighth consecutive year of record earnings for the october december quarter the company expects profit from its copier and printer unit to climb from a year earlier to billion yen it expects profit in its lucrative digital camera business to rise to billion yen in the period while office equipment is still canons biggest business the company is the worlds largest digital camera maker in terms of sales it has benefited strongly from the increased popularity of high end digital cameras as retail prices have come down enough for average consumers to buy them the company says its eos digital single lens reflex cameras are doing particularly well and it expects to ship million slrs this year a increase from million in slr cameras which can be purchased for less than &# are highly profitable their lenses are interchangeable but once consumers commit to a manufacturer they can buy compatible lenses only from the same company lenses can sell for thousands of dollars for many investors though canons exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is a significant negative factor their fears were realized last week when canon reported an drop in net profit for its july september quarter because a stronger yen eroded the value of overseas earnings when converted into the japanese currency in late september the dollar traded at about yen down from about yen at the end of june in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at yen canon like other companies tries to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations but the yens recent level is much stronger than the yen per dollar exchange rate that the company assumed for the year for each appreciation of one yen against the dollar canon loses about billion yen from its total sales jittery investors are likely to find little reassurance in forecasts on future exchange rate fluctuations predictions are split between those saying the rates will remain at current levels and those contending the yen will strengthen further but that isnt the only concern for investors canon which makes of its sales in the u s and europe would also be hurt particularly in its digital camera business if american consumer spending weakens recent signs there have been worrisome "the signs for consumer demand in the u s havent been so great recently " says marshall gittler chief asia strategist for deutsche banks private wealth management group citing a continued rise in oil prices and aggressive discounting by major retailers hoping to boost weak sales he added that consumer spending in canons home country also hasnt been as strong as some had expected even though the overall japanese economy continues to expand any slowdown would likely hurt sales of digital cameras the most because they are a luxury item still analysts say they are confident about canon on its printer and copier business alone office equipment has a business model that is similar to the model for digital cameras a customer who buys a printer from one manufacturer usually must buy related equipment such as toner cartridges from the same company "unless they make a huge misstep profits will naturally continue to grow " says naoki takahashi industry analyst for fitch ratings
