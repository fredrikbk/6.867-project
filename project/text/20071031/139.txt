the informed patient talking points making the most of doctor visits when her sister kelly rooney was battling breast cancer erin dugery went along to doctors appointments to help make sense of the treatment options but the medical jargon was often hard to understand and she often felt she had forgotten important questions her sister needed answered "on the drive to the appointment you think of a million things you want to ask but when you finally have the attention of the doctor its almost like getting stage fright " says the philadelphia mother of four ms rooney died months ago at age but ms dugery says she learned valuable lessons during her sisters illness such as writing down important questions beforehand and not being afraid to ask the doctor to explain things much of this advice came from an unusual source "doctor doctor lend me your ear " a one woman skit the sisters saw performed in florida by ms rooneys radiation oncologist marisa weiss dr weiss who strips off her white coat and clothes on stage to reveal a hospital gown uses humorous examples from her own experience to convey lessons on how to talk to and listen to your doctor dr weiss who has turned the lessons from the skit into a new book is one of a growing number of medical professionals and health care groups offering advice through books web sites dvds and even personal consultations to help patients navigate the modern doctors appointment though medical information has never been more accessible to consumers many patients still dont have the skills to talk to their doctors and cram all the questions they have about their health into a brief visit they often ignore what they dont understand or leave delicate but important issues to the end and then run out of time so to help patients get answers health care officials are offering new discussion aids providing sample questions patients can ask and offering advice ranging from making a list of your drugs to starting with the biggest questions first to checking that a doctor has your lab results before going to an appointment given the growing concern about patient safety and malpractice liability doctors too are under pressure to help patients ask the right questions in the limited time they have the joint commission a nonprofit group that accredits health care organizations recently began requiring hospitals to show that they are encouraging patients to participate in care for example health care providers should be encouraging patients to ask questions and using educational materials to help them make decisions a growing number of health literacy programs urge physicians to speak more slowly use plain language and when possible show models or actual devices or even draw pictures a survey by the boston based nonprofit foundation for informed medical decision making found that the majority of adults have big concerns about doctors not spending enough time to explain all treatment options the foundation whose work stems from research originally conducted at dartmouth medical school about unwarranted variations in health care practice is working with physician practice groups around the country to test videos books and pamphlets called shared decision making programs used at the dartmouth hitchcock medical center in lebanon n h and provided through health plans with about million members the aim is to see how they work when provided directly to patients by primary care offices "the doctors dont have time to explain everything you ought to know and they may not even be the best people to provide basic information and frame it for the patients " says floyd j fowler jr the foundations president the shared decision making materials which are organized by illness procedure and condition present background information to help patients make medical decisions including pros and cons of various treatment options risks and long term survival statistics patients can review the information in the doctors office before an appointment and take materials home to review with family members unlike a broad internet search dr fowler notes the decision aids synthesize the most important information for the specific decision a patient has to make such as whether to get a colorectal cancer screening or go forward with back surgery and how different treatment choices might affect their lifestyle or personal preferences yvonne west a year old nurse and mother of two teenage girls who was diagnosed with breast cancer learned of the shared decision making aids because pittsfield mass based berkshire health systems the hospital where she worked is participating in a test of the programs shortly before her own diagnosis her husband died of cancer after being treated with radiation and she was concerned about undergoing such treatment herself using the decision aids she reviewed the evidence for different options and the risks of recurrence before consulting with her doctor ultimately choosing a unilateral mastectomy and reconstruction the videos include real patients talking about their choices and why they made them "the videos got me thinking about the different options and really helped me with the decision process " says ms west consumers without access to such decision aids can still find help in preparing for doctor visits on web sites sponsored by disease advocacy groups hospitals and the federal government the american heart association americanheart org for example offers a list of questions that patients with high blood pressure and high cholesterol should ask while the boston based joslin diabetes center web site joslin org offers a list of questions that diabetics should ask doctors who are managing their disease and explanations of why each question is important researchers at the university of california los angeles say that as many as of patients bring more than one concern to a doctors visit and possibly as many as three or more in a study published this month in the journal of general internal medicine they suggest that a slight change in bedside manner can make a difference in whether all of these issues get addressed patients who were asked at the end of a doctors visit whether there was "something else" that needed attention were much less likely to leave with unmet concerns than those who were asked whether there was "anything else" that needed attention according to the study "any" tends to be used in a negative context predisposing patients to respond negatively with many doctor visits averaging minutes doctors clearly have to make every question count lead study author john heritage notes delia chiaramonte a baltimore area physician started a business called insight medical consultants that helps patients find medical experts make treatment decisions and communicate effectively with doctors she notes that patients often save their most important or embarrassing question for last then find the appointment is over with no time to address their most important concern "there is often a tremendous miscommunication between doctors and patients on what the visit is really about " says dr chiaramonte "if your no priority is talking about your erectile dysfunction its best to start with that " its also critical when making doctors appointments to be clear on whether it is simply a check up or you have a specific urgent complaint or problems with a chronic health issue doctors schedule their time differently for all three and should be prepared ahead of time dr chiaramonte suggests asking office staff what the best time is to schedule an appointment if you need more time to talk such as whether later in the day or the first appointment is best dr weiss whose book is titled "seven minutes how to get the most from your doctor visit " available for &# through her nonprofit web site breastcancer org advises that patients prepare a full report of any symptoms or concerns prior to the doctors visit as well as a complete list of current medications if you are awaiting interpretation of test results from a lab make sure before you arrive that the results have been sent and that the office staff have given them to the doctor she also advises bringing family members or a trusted friend not only for moral support but to act as another set of eyes and ears to listen to what the doctor is saying and to help organize questions since grasping the doctors words can be the hardest part of the visit she also advises using a tape recorder but first asking the doctors permission to do so ms dugery who started a web site savendbase com to help raise money for a foundation in her sisters name says she now uses dr weisss advice to advocate for herself and others in her extended family "even though your doctor may be the captain of the ship you are the first mate " says ms dugery "its really empowering to be able to find your own voice in your own care and in the care of your loved ones " email informedpatient wsj com
