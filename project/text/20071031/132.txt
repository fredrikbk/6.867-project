supreme court tv the seating of the u s supreme courts newest member samuel alito last year offered the promise that the court might finally allow television cameras into its proceedings alas in a speech at the university of virginia earlier this month justice alito came out against cameras in his new courtroom he joked that if permitted a televised court would compete with broadcasts of congress "for the lowest ratings that have ever been recorded by the nielsen system " justice alito is not alone every court member who has weighed in on the issue is opposed justice david souter once remarked "the day you see a camera come into our courtroom its going to roll over my dead body " why the hostility there are various reasons and concerns all of which can be refuted or addressed they include attorneys would play to the television audience its true some lawyers have a dramatic flair but ive sat through enough oral arguments to know that attorneys who wish to interject drama which rarely helps the client will do so irrespective of a cameras presence most lawyers realize that engaging in theatrics only exhausts the time that could be spent advancing the merits of their arguments the justices themselves would alter their behavior this argument requires us to assume that court members would act out for the cameras its possible that some members might preen a bit for viewers in tv land but its a safer assumption that the justices would comport themselves in a dignified manner consistent with their office notwithstanding the spotlights glare cameras and the other equipment would disrupt the proceedings that concern has been successfully addressed by many lower courts which have required the media to pool equipment needed for live broadcasts putting cameras in the courtroom would make justices more visible and thereby increase security risks there is some merit to this concern especially in the post environment the unfortunate response however is that any deranged person who wants to do harm to court members can probably recognize them already if security is a concern the justices can rely on the u s marshal service for protection to a greater extent than they do now security aside televising proceedings would make justices more recognizable and thus invade their privacy court members reportedly enjoy living in relative anonymity most of us do the justices however are diluting this argument by giving very public speeches and meeting with high profile journalists chief justice john roberts and justices john paul stevens ruth bader ginsburg and clarence thomas have been interviewed recently on national tv or by print reporters such appearances will likely continue holding high office today simply carries with it the burden of celebrity cameras in the court would yield little more than sound bite coverage of complicated cases this argument also applies to existing forms of media coverage if anything providing gavel to gavel television coverage would reduce the risk of sound bite simplification because viewers could observe arguments in their entirety justice alitos view might be correct few would tune in but some would including historians journalists and others who want to see how the court works the supreme courts practice of sometimes releasing same day audio transcripts of oral arguments satisfies any public need for information the court deserves credit for this policy but its not the same as live tv the expression accompanying a justices question a glance of disbelief in response to a lawyers answer and other nonverbal signals provide insight into the courts thinking large audiences can view this demeanor only through video broadcasts state supreme courts have routinely permitted television coverage of proceedings without negative consequences in my five years as a justice of the new jersey supreme court i witnessed no abuse of the cameras by lawyers or my judicial colleagues in my experience tv broadcasts enhanced judicial legitimacy by opening the process to viewers on a wide scale this isnt surprising americans usually have an easier time accepting government action when they observe it in plain view indeed the requirement of openness in court is older than the country itself the concessions and agreements of west new jersey a founding document for what later became the state of new jersey provided "that in all publick courts of justice for tryals or causes civil or criminal any person or persons inhabitants of the said province may freely come into and attend the said courts and hear and be present at all or any such tryals as shall be there had or passed that justice may not be done in a corner nor in any covert manner " i respect the u s supreme court as an institution and its individual members that said the courts policy against televised proceedings is on the wrong side of history the court should open its corner to the public on a large scale so we can better see that justice is being done mr verniero is a former justice of the new jersey supreme court and state attorney general he practices law at sills cummis &amp gross p c in newark n j
