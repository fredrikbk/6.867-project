departure of several midtier executives in recent days still looming are potentially bigger changes near the end of the year from a broad strategic review by gregory l curl the companys strategy and planning executive the blunt talk and swift moves by mr lewis have sparked worries among some big commercial clients about bank of americas intentions with the business and were a blow to the morale of current employees and some recruits according to people familiar with the situation mr lewis was known never to have been a fan of the high salaries and highflying personalities of some investment banking stars even as he pumped &# million into building up the unit as a major wall street player bank of america says that while the cuts under way are substantial and the results of the strategic review are unknown it is likely to retain its focus in debt issuance treasury management and lines of credit important areas for its relationships with major commercial customers hedge funds and institutional investors the bank said yesterday that only of the jobs cut are in global markets and investment banking significantly fewer than analysts expected mr lewis plans to reaffirm his commitment to the wall street unit tomorrow when he accepts an award at the british american chamber of commerce in new york "what is necessary to serve the client is what is going to stay after we do our strategic review " mr lewis said in a written statement yesterday he said the goal of the changes is to continue providing corporate customers "a wide range of products and services as part of a strategic relationship " but in a way that will still "deliver returns" for bank of america "this is not what people are reading it to be " mr moynihan said in an interview yesterday "the question is how do we align this business to the economy as its slowing down " mr moynihan who must quickly move his office from boston to new york where he has never lived or worked said his role will be to manage the day to day business help mr curl with the strategic review and implement its recommendations another issue facing moynihan is his own lack of experience on wall street mr moynihan years old

businesses im very familiar with " associates describe mr moynihan as a bulldog aggressive in his days on the rugby pitch and tenacious and blunt in the office he is the last of five top executives

dinovi co president of boston private equity firm thomas h lee partners lp said he has worked with mr moynihan on several deals over the years though he declined to name them mr dinovi said he took mr moynihans appointment as a reflection of mr lewiss commitment to the investment bank albeit potentially a reshaped version "obviously everyones watching to see who was going to get the position to read if this was a retreat or an investment in the investment banking business " mr dinovi said "i feel confident saying that having brian in charge is not a retreat its an investment "
