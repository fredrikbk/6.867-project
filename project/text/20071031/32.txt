corporate welfare the good kind i agree that this congress is certainly expanding corporate welfare programs that should be reduced or eliminated "the corporate welfare congress " review &amp outlook oct however i believe that it is a mischaracterization to label the commerce departments manufacturing extension program as corporate welfare welfare represents payments made directly to members of a group solely because they share a particular attribute that the government believes is appropriate to redress as far as i know none of the commerce department extension program funds are paid directly to manufacturers those federal funds along with funding from the states and funding provided by the manufacturers themselves are used to support a network of manufacturing extension agents these meas are held accountable for providing measurable benefits increased sales or reduced costs for the manufacturers they serve the majority of mea efforts and the benefits from this program at least in the states with which i am familiar go to the "little guys " not to major national or international companies my experience is that the manufacturing extension program is not welfare every manufacturing company that i have worked with has received some type of tangible benefit from the program bret b baker road grove okla we agree with your criticism of many of the wasteful government programs listed in your editorial however including the terrorism risk insurance act tria in an indictment of "corporate welfare" was a highly unfair characterization of a successful program that protects not only consumers and the business community but also and most importantly our nations economy far from being a "bailout" for insurers tria has protected millions of individuals businesses and the u s economy since january and has made it possible for insurers to cover an otherwise uninsurable risk more than of commercial insurance buyers elect to purchase coverage against terrorist attacks coverage that would not exist without tria moreover the program works very efficiently for taxpayers creating only negligible administrative costs to date the program recognizes that in the event of a terrorist attack we all share in the burden of dealing with the consequences without this federal backstop insurers could not possibly offer terrorism risk coverage due to the unpredictability of this type of risk and the threat it would pose to insurer solvency at the end of the day private insurers bear a significant financial responsibility for paying claims in essence tria serves as a &# billion "deductible" for taxpayers tria simply allows for a faster and more efficient claims settlement process and this is in everyones best interest we have seen what happens without tria in place after the sept terrorist attacks commercial building projects slowed almost to a standstill lenders would not finance projects lacking terrorism insurance which was largely unavailable and unaffordable when congress passed tria it revitalized the commercial building sector almost overnight creating jobs and helping to stimulate the economy without this important program those gains could just as quickly be lost the bottom line is that tria works it has created a foundation upon which our nations economic strength is built and it has sent a clear message to terrorists that they will not dictate to us what we can build and where we can build it it is in all americans interest for congress to renew this program before it expires on dec david a sampson president and ceo property casualty insurers association of america washington
