rage report reboot and finally accept another system crash the error reporting service built into the windows operating system is a massive global network for speaking truth to power be you a lowly clerk of accounts or a mighty captain of industry when a windows program crashes youll see a pop up with an offer to "tell microsoft about this problem " enough people around the world choose to do so that on the busiest days gigabytes of data from these error reports stream into microsoft two dozen programmers are charged with monitoring them the stories they tell of good computer programs going bad are full of the stuff of opera pride and sloth with lots of chaos theory and complexity thrown in errors come in two sorts kernel errors happen in the inner sanctum of the operating system which lets in only essential programs drivers and the like and then gives them free rein but if say a printer driver suddenly erases the kernel code needed to access the disk drive the operating system will have part of its brain cut out the result is the "blue screen of death" in windows or a "panic" in unix the applications we use dont have the same all access backstage passes as kernel programs when they crash the system itself usually stays up microsoft lists a dozen reasons for application crashes my favorite is the absence of "defensive programming " coders just like freeway drivers shouldnt assume other people are doing their jobs correctly if you ask for two bytes of data count the bytes when theyre handed back microsoft folks like trevor kurtz who heads one of the error checking teams are proud of their work how scrupulous they are about respecting user privacy how freely they share the aggregated data with outside software developers some things they wont tell you though which programs from microsoft or others crash the most who is at fault windows or the program the microsoft nominations from my household include internet explorer which regularly stalls and windows explorer which on full drives cant properly execute the keyboard shortcut for opening all folders and subfolders its far from all bad though word and excel seem like gibraltar and months now go by in between blue screens the experience of dealing with a software bug can involve an emotional journey that starts with helpless blind rage and ends with if not a kubler ross style of acceptance then at least a little empathy adobe allowed me to better understand bug ology by helping me with problems with premiere pro an amazingly powerful piece of video editing software that alas seems to crash more than i had anticipated one particular crash involved with making screen titles seemed especially crude and adobe thought it might involve a video driver it didnt the next step was the lengthy process of turning parts of the system off and on to see what made a difference its the computer equivalent of taking endless allergy tests to see whats making you sneeze i declined frequent saving of my project was easier adobe support engineer mitch wood told me about a bit of premiere pro sleuthing he had just finished with a user who couldnt import video it took many hours to figure out that a piece of software from a small company had mislabeled one of its tiny graphics routines that slip up cascaded throughout windows and ended up keeping premiere pro from doing its job that sort of complexity is part of what makes the personal computer so exciting but as the story shows its also one of the main causes of all the errors that drive users nuts there is just so much that can go wrong why then do so many software companies make it even worse with their napoleonic software thats my phrase for half pint programs that crown themselves emperor by insisting pridefully that they launch when windows launches or by sticking a miniversion of themselves in memory at all times the latter is supposed to speed their own start up but in addition to adding to the systems complexity and thus its tendency to crash these programs play a cynical zero sum game the time saved launching the program must of necessity be transferred instead to windows boot time which we all know doesnt need to get any longer companies sometimes do this to be able to push out program updates every few weeks had dante used a computer he surely would have created a special circle of hell for programs that gratuitously update worse these often also make you reboot windows properly done rarely needs rebooting but because of slothful updates they can be a daily curse in an update all the old versions must be shut down programmers can write some code to do that or they can have users do it for them by taking five minutes out of their busy lives to reboot mahadev satyanarayanan who teaches computers at carnegie mellon says its impossible for software to be defect free still he thinks microsoft folks would be better off if in open source fashion they let others see under the hood a million eyes
