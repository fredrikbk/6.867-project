merrills job cleaning up and moving on cribiore leads search for ceo amid prospect of even more losses as the board of merrill lynch &amp co searches for a successor to ousted chief executive stan oneal it finds itself in the tricky position of selecting an executive who will stem the losses in merrills battered bond business stabilizing the firm but will not be so risk averse as to turn back the gains mr oneal made in making merrill more profitable one of managements first headaches will be a regulatory inquiry by the enforcement staff of the securities and exchange commission into the adequacy of merrills disclosures to investors about an &# billion write down that fueled mr oneals ouster according to people familiar with the inquiry merrill declined to comment on the probe the board yesterday named director alberto cribiore a longtime wall street buyout executive to lead its ceo search among internal and external candidates leaving current management largely in place the firm awarded responsibility for all the firms revenue generating activities and risk management to co president gregory fleming effectively making him the front runner among internal candidates for the top job in doing so the board limited merrills other co president ahmass fakahany to support functions finance and human resources which some others called a signal of his expected eventual departure mr fakahany formerly shared oversight of merrills bond market activities including a big buildup of its position in collateralized debt obligations which are pools of securities backed by assets such as subprime mortgages to risky borrowers that plummeted in value this year the chief executive search is complicated by the risky nature of the firms remaining &# billion in holdings of cdos and subprime mortgages which analysts expect could generate an additional &# billion in loses in the fourth quarter any new chief executive may need time to evaluate such holdings before signing up for the job indeed the sec inquiry is likely to address how merrill has been valuing such holdings during the subprime credit crunch this year and how fully the wall street brokerage informed investors of the possible losses the people familiar with the probe said one of the issues in the sec inquiry is likely to be whether merrill executives had any inkling that such losses were in the offing when the firm reported better than expected earnings for the second quarter on july as the credit crunch was gathering steam the people said another issue is likely to be why merrill first projected the write down on cdos and buyout loan commitments at &# billion on october then ratcheted up the total to &# billion when it reported its third quarter earnings on oct yesterday a law firm that represents investors filed a lawsuit seeking class action status charging that merrill misled investors by issuing "false and misleading statements" about its finances in a statement merrill said "the suit has no merit we reported our financial data accurately " mr oneal as expected announced his retirement yesterday and will walk away with &# million in restricted stock options and retirement benefits he will also get a merrill paid office and assistant for three years merrill directors didnt offer mr oneal cash severance or a bonus for they and he agreed he had accumulated considerable wealth during his year career made a lot of money last year and didnt deserve extra rewards on his way out the door according to a person close to the situation mr oneals ouster after the losses makes him the highest profile casualty of the subprime mortgage debacle but the losses have obscured that mr oneal made significant gains ramping up the firms expansion into more international markets and bigger growth areas such as commodities and private equity in a statement mr oneal said he had "especially enjoyed working with a group of people whose collective efforts have enabled us to make merrill lynch a much more competitive and international company " while merrill stumbled because it didnt have the right people and risk management some investors hope his successor doesnt turn back the clock to the firms lower profit margins of the s "mother merrill" era mother merrill is often used to describe the firms high cost paternalistic culture of days gone by mr oneal doubled the firms return on equity said peter sorrentino a former merrill broker who is now a money manager at huntington national bank in columbus ohio which owns merrill shares merrill cant operate as a modern securities firm "without taking on risk and you cant throw the baby out with the bathwater " he said analysts and investors say the company needs to overhaul its risk management procedures without sacrificing the earnings power of its institutional securities business which in contributed of the firms pretax operating profits "the key is not going back to solely acting as an agent for pennies a share but at the same time not repeating this kind of huge risk mishap " said michael mayo of deutsche bank ag as reported the most prominent external candidate for ceo is blackrock inc chief executive laurence fink whose company specialized in bonds before adding merrills stock oriented asset management business in exchange for a blackrock stake last year mr oneal also stepped down from the blackrock board yesterday as well in weighing the losses and debating mr oneals fate merrill directors were advised over the past few weeks by a legal team led by allen finkelson of cravath swaine
