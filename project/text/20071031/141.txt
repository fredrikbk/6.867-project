the kingdom king abdullah caused an uproar ahead of a visit to britain this week by scolding his hosts about terrorism but as long as the saudi monarch has raised the subject by all means lets debate the kingdoms role in promoting radical islam in a bbc interview monday king abdullah said that "most countries are not taking this issue terrorism too seriously including unfortunately great britain " the king also claimed through a translator that his security services had provided information that could have prevented the july bombings in london implying that u k authorities chose to ignore it the royal musings didnt go down well perhaps because saudi arabia churns out manpower money and spiritual inspiration for jihadis around the world british intelligence service mi yesterday refuted the accusations saying saudi information was "clearly not relevant to those attacks " but the brits might as well press the king further on the subject by asking about saudi arabias efforts to export its state sanctioned brand of radical islam wahabism to madrassas and mosques around the world britain is one of the biggest targets policy exchange a think tank put out a report monday that saudi arabia was the source of much of the extremist material found in british mosques according to the conclusions of a year long investigation that material included calls for the murder of muslim "apostates" and gays as well as anti western incitement it was either written by members of the saudi religious establishment or distributed by the countrys institutions or found in saudi funded mosques "the influence of saudi arabia is both powerful and malign " the report concludes when prime minister gordon brown sits down with the year old monarch today he can tell him how "seriously" he takes the saudi connection to islamic terrorism
