secrets of the auction houses loose lips sink art sales well that wont ever appear on a poster but the art trade seems convinced that secrecy is vital to making deals take the auction houses which keep a lot of secrets there is a "reserve" price the unstated amount below which the consignor will not sell the lot for many of the more expensive objects in a sale and phantom or "chandelier" bids that the auctioneer announces and records to get the bidding up to that reserve the auction house may have advanced or lent money to a bidder to help that person acquire an artwork or brought in a third party usually a private dealer or collector to guarantee a certain price required by a consignor none of the other bidders will be told and of course the auction houses hardly ever reveal the identities of buyers early next month christies and sothebys hold their signature impressionist and modern sales nov at christies and nov at sothebys both full of paintings and sculpture with multimillion dollar estimates set by the auction houses which give collectors another opportunity to bid in the dark secrecy certainly has its defenders "chandelier bids get the momentum going and build excitement in an auction " said debra force former head of the american art department at christies and currently a manhattan gallery owner "the public doesnt need to know what the reserve is " chicago auctioneer leslie hindman stated and disclosing it "would prohibit competition " but the lack of transparency raises the question of whether prices are artificially high to what degree is the art market reaching new heights in the volume of sales and prices particularly for modern and contemporary art buoyed on factors that make it noncompetitive "its hard to build momentum and activity and the so called chandelier bidding is a way of doing that " said alan fausel director of the american paintings and sculpture department at san francisco based bonham &amp butterfields "i dont know if anyone is fooled by it " additionally he and other auction house staffers claim that publicly revealing the reserve "would drive a substantial amount of business to london " according to a sothebys prepared statement and that bidding up to the reserve wards off organized bidders often groups of dealers called "rings" that converge at a sale with the idea of jointly keeping the prices low sothebys spokeswoman diana phillips stated in an email that consumer protection rules governing auctioneering have "created a fair and rational marketplace which has kept new york city the leading market center in the world " still mr fausel noted that his auction house generally does not make loans to bidders only to consignors in the form of an advance and avoids making guarantees "our general philosophy is to try to keep more of an arms length and not to have a financial interest in the artworks up for sale because that can get ethically sticky " economists who have studied the art market find little to like about secrecy or "information asymmetry " "the loans and guarantees and overall secrecy are a form of manipulation by the auction houses to increase their profits " said william baumol a professor of economics at new york university "secrecy keeps you from knowing youre paying too much " said rachel campbell an economics professor at the university of maastricht holland and an adviser to londons fine art fund the premier hedge fund in the art investment field george akerlof who won the nobel prize for economics in for his research into asymmetric information called the buying and selling of art "a rather open market " but for those unaware of available information and where to obtain reliable advice the art market may be "bad capitalism " he said "capitalism is great at producing what people want however many buyers may not know what they want or are willing to pay for something if buyers are willing to pay more than a picture is worth then capitalism will create institutions that take advantage of them " artificially high prices also make artworks less accessible "many of my clients have watched the prices go up and up to the point that they are unable to compete for a number of works " said neil meltzer an art dealer and private art adviser in manhattan for example loans by auction houses to prospective bidders buoy prices at high levels and generally elevate sales for other similar lots this famously happened in when sothebys sold vincent van goghs "irises" to alan bond for &# million based on a &# million loan it secretly made to the australian tycoon that he was ultimately unable to repay the sale set a benchmark for post impressionist works guarantees are another price maintenance system helpful in reducing a consignors risk and potentially increasing profits for the guarantor of the final sales price which takes a percentage of the earnings over the guaranteed price robert mnuchin owner of new yorks l&amp m arts says that he has been a partner with auction houses in guaranteeing artworks and that "on balance its been successful " he added that such partnerships take place all the time in other investment realms "think of underwriters and mortgage bankers " third party participation in a sale is not revealed to bidders "a dealer who has an interest in a certain lot might promote it to another dealer or a collector hey you should go after this work its really a great piece " said roland augustine director of manhattans luhring augustine gallery and president of the art dealers association of america because of that potential for manipulation mr augustine advocated making any third party guarantors identity public mr mnuchin however objected strongly to that suggestion claiming that he did not know of any dealers who have been third party guarantors and have promoted to potential buyers an auction lot in which they had a financial interest in classical economic theory the efficiency of the market requires all rational consumers to have full knowledge of the products they are looking to buy and what others in the market are doing consumers presumably will reward the sellers of better merchandise with higher prices economists often theorize that more information leads to higher prices overall as consumers will pay more when they have greater confidence borne of more knowledge the auction process is also supposed to work with a strong measure of transparency so that the middlemen are seen as disinterested brokers rather than self interested stakeholders theoretically one doesnt need middlemen and auction houses justify their commissions on the basis of expertise research and ability to attract those willing to buy and sell artificially pushing up prices and commissions through secretive measures should undercut consumer trust and the auction houses reason to be the art market may not respond to traditional economic theory because many buyers do not see artwork primarily as a financial investment collectors retain art for an average of years far longer than their other assets according to several studies and the main reasons for selling are what auctioneers call the "three ds" death debt and divorce not pure profit taking anders petterson a former investment banker and now managing director of the london based arttactic art market research and advisory firm stated that "a better theoretical framework would be to look at the theories around behavioral finance such as herd behavior market anchors greater fools theory overconfidence etc " secrecy and the preferential treatment of certain consignors and buyers help create "something exclusive something which makes even the most wealthy beg for it particularly in times when people have a lot of disposable income " of course the very wealthy usually think of themselves as very smart and studies and indexes indicate that art over the long term is a good investment karl schweizer head of art banking at the swiss based financial services firm ubs says the correlation between burgeoning global wealth creation and the expanding art market has also led to a growing number of art advisory services for wealthy collectors "no one wants to be the stupid one being seen as spending too much money for nothing " twenty years ago the new york department of consumer affairs promulgated rules about art galleries revealing their prices in a public manner which it promptly chose not to enforce now a bill requiring auction houses to reveal their reserve prices is awaiting action in the state legislature a more transparent landscape is one picture the art trade doesnt want to see mr grant is the author of "the business of being an artist" allworth see
