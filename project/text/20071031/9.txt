alliant techsystems aims high midsize firm seeks bigger nasa role despite budget pressures alliant techsystems inc was for years a staid supplier of rocket motors content to ride along as aerospace giants like boeing co and lockheed martin corp guided prestigious multibillion dollar space projects but as the u s embarks on a new push for manned exploration of space the midsize edina minn company hopes to play a central role in charting the course alliant techsystems beat out its bigger competitors to snare high profile contracts valued at more than &# billion over the next few years and probably billions more down the road to build big chunks of the proposed ares rocket the rocket set to replace the current space shuttles booster system will blast astronauts into orbit and provide the backbone for a manned return to the moon creation of a lunar base and trips to mars alliant is the u s national aeronautics and space administrations fourth largest contractor by annual revenue providing everything from solar arrays to crew evacuation systems but hopes to move higher its new business is expected to more than make up for declining work as the space shuttle is gradually retired resulting in expected space exploration revenue from nasa of nearly &# million by versus about &# million currently "were really just stretching out and expanding beyond" the traditional subcontractor says ron dittemore who runs the companys launch systems group the company captured a growing role by posting advances in its systems engineering capabilities in part by making niche acquisitions to fill out its portfolio it also hired a cadre of former government managers and former astronauts to give it a leg up in navigating nasas bureaucracy a company marketing campaign evoking the sense of adventure of manned space flight also has helped promote its efforts the companys lobbying efforts and advertisements tout the prestige and long term educational benefits of manned nasa missions sometimes featuring photos of wide eyed elementary school students alliant executives have "worked very hard to promote their concept of future launch vehicles " says elliot pulham president of the space foundation an industry supported space advocacy group the companys management seems adamant he adds "to carve out as large a niche as possible in manned space exploration " manned space work carries more than glamor leading major contracts involving a number of suppliers offer fat profit margins space work also lets companies develop products for other uses alliant hopes to turn the gains with nasa into a broader strategic shift aggressively pursuing commercial and defense businesses that so far have been ignored or underemphasized by larger rivals already some alliant executives are raising the notion that ares rockets eventually could be used by commercial and perhaps even u s military customers yet manned space flight projects can also take contractors on budgetary roller coaster rides president bush has made a return to the moon and a manned mission to mars a priority but the space program has historically been targeted when spending priorities turn to defense or social issues roger krone a senior boeing space official worries "space is losing its footing as a national priority " without firm white house leadership on space issues adds john douglass president of the aerospace industries association a space trade group "were going to see a period of extreme drift " alliant whose market capitalization of about &# billion makes it less than one tenth the size of lockheed martin will be much more dependent on nasa than bigger broader rivals about of annual revenue is slated to come from nasa work by the end of this fiscal year which ends in march space launch systems and advanced weapons systems revenue together are projected to grow by more than a year nearly twice as fast as its munitions and its other legacy businesses lockheed martin was tapped to build the spacecraft intended to eventually return americans to the moon but nasa business still is expected to account for only a slice of the bethesda md companys overall roughly &# billion annual revenue from satellites rocket and other space ventures alliant officials believe the industry and nasa have fostered enough support from lawmakers to fund the next generation of space travel they also cite the new programs use of older existing technology and savings from retiring the space shuttle three years ago its traditional simpler nasa business "was flat to declining" and the companys stock took a hit says chairman and chief executive daniel murphy a retired navy admiral "now it represents a robust growth opportunity " he says in the future alliants management envisions being a more integral part of nasa providing composite parts for space vehicles and participating in designing a lunar base and planning manned missions to mars to further that aim mr murphy earlier this month said he was willing to spend as much as &# billion on acquisitions intended to increase the companys international profile beef up its civilian businesses or boost capabilities to manufacture ceramics and other aerospace materials alliant recently hired former high ranking nasa official michael bloomfield to set up its first houston office located near the agencys manned space hub alliants tactics have helped boost its share price nearly over the past year yesterday shares were down &# to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading for fiscal alliant is on track to report double digit jumps in sales and per share earnings for the fourth straight year excluding special items it is expected to report a profit of more than &# million or more than &# a share on revenue of nearly &# billion alliant hopes its gains at nasa also will help win pentagon orders defense spending while also coming under pressure is more protected than space programs when congress looks for budget cuts building on its manufacturing track record and growing technical skill alliant has received initial funding from the military to pursue cost saving proposals to adapt its existing family of different sized rocket motors for use in various missiles and precision guided weapons the goal according to the launch groups mr dittemore a former senior nasa manager is "to position ourselves with the skills the talents and our inventory" of existing rocket motors to be able to "mix and match fairly quickly" in devising smaller more flexible launchers
