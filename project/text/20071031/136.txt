todays gdp figures at nomura securities analysts wrote that "the surprising gdp strength could be enough to persuade the fomc to defer any decision about the need for another rate cut until a clearer picture of the fourth quarter has formed " and analysts with bear stearns wrapped up their gdp commentary by noting refound strength in an employment report from payroll processing giant adp "with the evidence from this mornings adp report suggesting that private payrolls grew around in october and with back to back quarters of near real gdp growth the economic argument for a further rate cut at
