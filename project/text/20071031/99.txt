office space market shows signs of slowing a volume indicator rises for first time in years businesses play it safe the amount of sublease office space available to tenants increased nationally for the first time in five years an indication that commercial leasing is slowing in many markets across the u s the increase demonstrates that many businesses related to home mortgage lending have returned space to the market it also shows that many industries are nervous in light of the credit market turmoil and want to keep costs down as much as possible until they see whether the economy will slump further in coming months sublease space in which tenants lease their rented space to other tenants usually at below market prices increased to million square feet in the third quarter from million square feet nationwide in the second quarter according to data provided by grubb &amp ellis co a real estate services firm based in chicago that marked the first national increase since the third quarter of when the economy was in recession after the dot com bust and the terrorist attacks of in the third quarter last year available space was million square feet the amount of sublease space in a market can affect the extent to which landlords can push up rents because their "direct" space is competing with short term sublease space that is often much cheaper and tenants have more bargaining power a total of million square feet is only about half the amount that was available in the so called shadow market at the bottom of the cycle in the first quarter of and shouldnt be reason for office landlords to despair yet the increase in sublease space combined with a national vacancy rate that remained flat or barely budged downward over the quarter depending whose data are used indicates the market could be softening says bob bach senior vice president of research for grubb &amp ellis even so rents continue to climb average effective rents the amount tenants pay after concessions increased nationwide over the third quarter according to reis inc a real estate research firm yet soaring rents over the past few quarters could be one reason that sublease space is on the rise as costs increase businesses may look to downsize or even move out of a market to save money even as they must still pay on their previous lease "some of it is part and parcel of a market when rents have been rising rapidly and suddenly theres more uncertainty and caution " mr bach says such uncertainty is related to the continuing fallout from the home mortgage industry many troubled lenders are closing branch offices and home builders have scaled back their operations indeed countrywide financial corp the nations biggest home mortgage lender is putting as much as square feet of office space in the dallas suburb of richardson texas on the shadow market and another square feet in nearby arlington according to tim terrell of stream realty partners lp who represents countrywide sublease space increased over the third quarter in of the markets that grubb &amp ellis monitors while shadow space continued to drop in the strongest office markets such as new york boston and san francisco mr bach predicts that even those markets will start to see an increase in coming quarters in south florida one of the areas hardest hit by the housing crisis sublease space in miami dade county increased over the past four quarters and increased in fort lauderdale broward county over that time moreover rising rents in florida have been compounded by escalating insurance premiums for storm coverage and higher real estate taxes because of the run up in property valuations forcing some tenants to look for cheaper space san diego where sublease space has increased over the past four quarters also has been hit hard by the housing crisis as well as an increase in office supply developers have added four million square feet of office space in the past few years thus in some case tenants are getting good deals on new space and subletting their older offices "for the most part in san diego county there are a fair amount of opportunities in the marketplace today to leverage a transaction " says brian ffrench a san diego based senior executive with studley inc a tenant representation firm studley represented one law firm mintz levin cohn ferris glovsky &amp popeo pc in taking more than a floor of sublease space in the northern part of the county that was vacated by an investment firm that decided against maintaining so large an office in san diego that allowed mintz levin to get palatial offices at below market rate in orange county calif where many of the mortgage brokers are based the amount of sublease space on the market hasnt changed since this time last year about million square feet that is because many of those lenders "threw in the keys " mr bach says and filed for bankruptcy so the space is being marketed by landlords as direct space instead of sublease the vacancy rate there ticked up percentage point over the past quarter reis found
