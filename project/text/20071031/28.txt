business is there a second act for oneal after merrill america is supposed to be a great country for second chances historians relish the roller coaster careers of abraham lincoln and richard nixon both written off as hopeless losers only to rise to the presidency a few years later recent corporate comebacks are just as startling wasnt robert nardelli portrayed as a pariah for life after losing the top job at home depot inc in january guess again in august he resurfaced with a dazzling new job running chrysler llc all of which invites outsiders to keep a keen eye on the eventual destiny of stan oneal who stepped aside yesterday as chairman and chief executive of merrill lynch &amp co during the final weeks of his tenure merrill posted a &# billion third quarter loss fueled by an &# billion charge for problem loans mr oneal fared somewhat better his retirement package totals &# million merrills dismal performance means that even mr oneals defenders dont expect him to attract new ceo offers right away the banking and brokerage companys stock has skidded this year while its credit ratings have been downgraded it may take years to mend the firm whats more mr oneal became known at merrill for his tough brittle style and the rapid turnover among his lieutenants firms that want a charming boss are likely to look elsewhere yet with the passage of time wall street tends to forgive high achievers with one dreadful year blighting their resumes consider larry fink the well regarded ceo of blackrock inc a leading money management firm who has been mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed mr oneal back in the second quarter of mr finks mortgage desk at first boston corp ran up &# million of trading losses "i should have been fired " mr fink later told a magazine interviewer mr fink wasnt and that early misstep hardly figures into current evaluations of his skills on paper mr oneal someday might be able to portray himself in a similar light he took command as merrills ceo in december and for the first few years on the job the companys stock and earnings surged he was seen as a hard edged boss who could push merrill out of complacency mr oneals life story also attracted admirers he is the first african american to run a major wall street firm he picked cotton in alabama as a child and worked on the general motors corp assembly line as a young man he went on to earn a harvard mba and arrived on wall street at age later than many of his contemporaries where he relied on hard work and ambition to make up for lost time but recent experience suggests that the high level job market isnt always friendly to outsiders women minorities and foreign born executives who have stumbled once they may be encouraged to aim high the first time when their records are unblemished if something goes wrong though its much harder for them to get a fresh chance franklin raines was an oft lauded african american executive when he was ceo of fannie mae he left that position in late after scrapping with regulators about the mortgage concerns accounting no big public company has hired him since he didnt return calls seeking an update on his career plans carly fiorina the former ceo of hewlett packard co left in february after a clash with her board she has been active on various commissions and corporate boards but also hasnt returned to big company leadership ousted ceos who have bounced back like chryslers mr nardelli benefited greatly from continued support by their friends and mentors networking cant rescue everyone if fraud or personal misconduct led to a ceos firing thats almost always the end of the story but in many cases recruiters say its white male executives who mingle on the golf course work their college networks and benefit from apprenticeships at giant companies such as general electric co who are most likely to have strong booster networks whats more companies looking for a new ceo generally want someone with star appeal who could send their stock soaring merely by announcing that he or she was about to take the top job some recruiters say that even if they want to widen the candidate pool to include outsiders on the rebound they have a hard time convincing boards that such candidates would work magic on the stock price several people who talked to mr oneal say it wouldnt surprise them if he signed on at some point with a leading private equity firm that would enable him to analyze deals make investments and perhaps take charge of a nonpublic portfolio company if he wanted the scope of operations would be smaller than merrill but his ownership stakes might be much bigger "private equity is a very forgiving environment" for onetime corporate bosses looking to restart their careers says one leading recruiter among executives going this route are kevin rollins the former ceo of dell inc and jacques nasser the former chief of ford motor co mr oneals merrill lynch payout is big enough that he neednt ever work again yet at age he is young enough to tackle another big project and its a good bet that he will look for a way to vindicate himself who knows he may even write a book
