european imperialism microsoft waved the white flag this month by dropping all appeals of the european unions ruling against the software giant the episode shows that europe now writes the rules for global business across the board unapologetically to the benefit of its own industry american companies are learning they have little choice but to obey for the past half century europe was supposed to be building a free market but old habits die hard and many continental politicians think more and better regulation is the route to prosperity their control over access to a consumer market of million lets them try to force the rest of the world to play by its cumbersome rules the result is a quiet but concerted war on non european commerce and especially on u s companies antitrust policy in brussels is a battlefield particularly for high tech firms mario monti the former eu competition czar who issued the ruling against microsofts software "bundling " told an italian newspaper last month that putting such u s giants in their place was "the true strength of a united europe " his successor neelie kroes celebrated a court decision upholding that decision by musing about how low shed like microsofts market share to fall next in her sights are intel qualcomm apple and google among others older industries arent immune consider a small but revealing dispute over american poultry since the eu has banned chicken meat rinsed in such antimicrobial treatments as chlorine in europe poultry meat can be "washed" only in potable water the eu said the chemicals used in the u s were dangerous then changed its mind two years ago when its own food safety authority declared them harmless but the ban remains in place while europes environmental barons hunt for fresh reasons to justify it the latest mooted by eu officials the potential harm to the environment if the chemical rinse were used in europe but washington isnt asking the eu to allow the cleansing practice there only that it allow cleansed american chicken into europe u s poultry farmers in the meantime are losing a significant market u s chicken exports to romania were &# million in but they stopped cold when bucharest joined the eu this year european poultry farmers love this absence of american competition but the larger eu motive is to force its environmental standards on the u s in another example brussels wants to force any airline flying to or from europe to participate in its carbon cap and trade scheme by never mind that the rest of the world wants airline emissions to be dealt with in a single global system listening to the world would hurt european carriers which are mandated to join the eus cap and trade regime in so much for europes love of multilateralism then theres the new "reach" law that expands european purview over the global chemicals industry substances safely used for decades all over the world now have to be retested and recertified eu lawmakers saw an opening to impose tough standards on other countries if foreign companies want their products sold in europe but they didnt stop there and slapped additional burdens on non european firms foreign cosmetic companies for instance are required to register all chemicals in their products by june the deadline for their european rivals is at least three years away at stake for u s makers is their &# billion in annual exports to europe american companies are scrambling to meet this deadline even as they wait for brussels to approve new alternatives to animal testing which is banned for products sold in the eu starting in or consider financial regulation earlier this year the u s securities and exchange commission agreed to let companies submit some financial statements using new international accounting standards rather than u s gaap principles the european parliament responded to this goodwill gesture for which brussels had lobbied hard by insisting that the sec accept a special version of the accounting rules tailored to the eu the larger theme here is that unelected officials in brussels and protectionist politicians in eu capitals are using their regulatory power as a tool of economic nationalism under the cover of some nice sounding social goals they are harming u s companies and reducing commercial freedom this is a growing threat to u s prosperity and american politicians and regulators had better wake up to it
