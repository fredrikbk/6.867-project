the daily fix lakers fans let boos rain before opening night loss online edition after hearing that kobe bryant wants to leave them and that the front office is working to make that happen los angeles lakers fans ushered in the new nba season last night by greeting their three time champ and th year veteran last night with boos "here were the laker lovers the worshippers of all things purple and gold the people who really know jack summoning venom for one of their own the most beloved of their own even " jeff miller writes in the orange county register "this was a breakthrough for the present sporting era in l a an east coast moment in the most west coast of venues on opening night with the franchise celebrating its th season with a few of the usual stars aligned courtside the on court star indeed was maligned if only by a vocal minority " then bryant turned those boos into full gamut of fan reaction noises by excelling in the lakers loss to the houston rockets "true to form bryant was as brilliant as he often is when the chips are down especially when hes the one who has overturned them scoring points " mark heisler writes in the los angeles times "the noticeable boos in the mixed reception he received before the game turned into hopeful chants of ko be ko be in the second half and screams and gasps at the end these days lakers fans dont know whether to cheer or boo hope or mourn " if they want help deciding they can play with espn coms nifty nba trade machine and see which potential kobe deals would be allowed under league rules the lakers roared back from points down with points remaining to tie the game and the rockets needed a shane battier three pointer with seconds left to win to build that lead houston relied on its newly balanced offensive attack "in some ways this is the kind of game the rockets had in mind last summer when they began adding scorers " richard justice writes in the houston chronicle "theyd lost too many games like this and wanted to see if they could rewrite the ending " during their recent run of nba near dominance the san antonio spurs have always chosen to take off at least a year between championships they opened this years title defense in a game of contrasts pitting their aging roster against the young portland trail blazers with a median age of the oregonians john canzano calls them trail blazers u "what we have here is not only the beginning of a season but an opportunity to see brandon roy and lamarcus aldridge as sophomores " mr canzano writes "and to see if tbu really is committed to the principles of free expression pioneering research and a collaborative environment like the unofficial university mission statement says " tony parker at age is one of the youngest spurs yet older than most blazers junes nba finals mvp declares himself a "veteran " complete with ankle tape but hes also far from his peak buck harvey writes in the san antonio express news "he said last spring during the playoffs that hes years away from his prime and becoming the finals mvp didnt change his projection " mr harvey writes "steve nash jason kidd they got better as they got older for parker this has been step by step progress he arrived as a boy among men starting as a teenager gregg popovich played the role of dad albeit an often red faced and angry dad " the golden state warriors lost in the second round of the playoffs last year to the utah jazz who lost to the spurs in the conference finals but you might have thought golden state was launching a title defense from the giddy pregame intros last night perhaps not befitting a team that barely qualified for the playoffs with the eighth seed the jazz watched it all then romped "ten minutes devoted solely to warriors player introductions can be very confusing and distracting especially when the opponents happen to be the guys who ended the warriors dizzy run last season " tim kawakami writes in the san jose mercury news "throw in the earthquake that rumbled through the arena as andris biedrins shot free throws in the first quarter already a shaky proposition and you can understand the general tilt and stumble of this contest unfortunately for the warriors on this night they could summon little of the wild energy and mph wallop that fueled their home romps last season and got them into the playoffs for the first time in years unfortunately for the warriors utah remains bigger stronger and more determined than the great eighth seed " its appropriate that the nba season began out west since the conference had the leagues four winningest teams last season and its champs swept the finals but kevin garnett the new arrival in boston from minnesota is a top reason to hope that the east will balance things this year the boston globes shira springer recounts mr garnetts evolution into a high school phenom when he moved to chicago from south carolina the subtext "the first big move garnett made from mauldin south carolina to chicago showed the kind of transformation that can take place within one year with a change of scenery " ms springer writes its hard not to root for mr garnett when he earnestly declares his love for his job "when im done in these next four or five years i will still have my basketball " he tells ms springer "i will still have my court ill still go to it when i need to figure something out or im going through a little something ill still go to the court and just get lost it will always be my book basketball is my spine its my heart its my blood its my makeup " no words written about the trinity university tigers last second play to win a football game saturday can match the video which if you havent seen you can watch here whew now that youre back and have caught your breath heres a chart from the san antonio express news diagramming those laterals several of them coming just before a sure tackle or just inches from the sidelines the tigers kept running at full tilt on the play while their opponents the millsaps college majors "had five or six guys just quit on the play " their coach mike dubose told the jackson clarion ledgers mike christensen "if we play as hard as we can until the final whistle blows and we still get beat on a play like that im ok with it " he says "that type of thing just shouldnt happen sure we were tired but so was trinity you have to finish the play we stopped " therein lies a teaching tool for other coaches tim griffin writes in the express news several big coaches tell him theyll use the video to remind their team that it aint over etc next spring trey hillman will manage the kansas city royals today hes the lame duck manager of the nippon ham fighters who are down in the japan series last night in japan with the fighters down kansas city star columnist joe posnanski considered the skippers predicament with everyone doubting his commitment to the games at hand as he secretly must be thinking ahead to kc "he keeps it hidden " mr posnanski writes "he knows though that many people in japan simply would not understand no matter how carefully he explained and he loves japan he loves these players he loves the fans here these five years have been a special time in his life and he wants people here to know how grateful he is for them " jan silva is five years old yikes "at an age when most boys are still picking the scabs on their knees in the primary school playground silva is famous around the tennis globe " mark hodgkinson writes in the daily telegraph "true andre agassi and tracy austin were both billed as wonder kids not long after they had taken up the game but the interest in those two was nothing next to the buzz around silva who has been training at the mouratoglou tennis academy outside paris since he was four after his parents sold their american home and everything in it to finance his sporting education just take a look at the welcome page on his website jansilvatennis com which declares a star has been born as did mozart on the piano so does jan silva on the tennis court tracy austin and andy murrays former coach are among those who are impressed with jans game you can form
