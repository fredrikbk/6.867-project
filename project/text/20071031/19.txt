bernanke in first crisis rewrites fed playbook chief taps brain trust to ease credit crunch life after greenspan washington on the afternoon of thursday aug with a panic driving up short term interest rates in europe and the u s federal reserve chairman ben bernankes office became a war room his closest advisers took seats in the burgundy leather chairs around a coffee table or telephoned in from their now aborted vacations mr bernanke a former academic vaulted months earlier to the worlds most powerful economic job was seeking counsel from colleagues of all stripes from a thirtysomething former investment banker to a federal reserve veteran of nearly four decades who had participated in almost every important fed decision of the past years he pushed them to spit out as much information as possible about the days events what he asked do we know what must we learn and what are our options the roots of the crisis had been apparent for months in rising numbers homeowners with subprime mortgages those made to the least credit worthy home buyers were delinquent on payments hedge funds and other institutions had bought opaque securities backed by these mortgages but they were difficult to value and potentially hard to trade that morning it became clear that european banks had more exposure than previously thought sparking a scramble for cash by some banks and a reluctance to lend that instantly jumped the atlantic the aug meeting in mr bernankes office kicked off weeks of brainstorming over ways to restore calm to credit markets the wide ranging tone of the subsequent discussions was encapsulated in subject lines of some emails mr bernanke and his aides exchanged "blue sky " one fed governor spent hours on the phone grilling contacts on wall street another official helped broker a deal to help mortgage lender countrywide financial corp through a financing squeeze aiming to avert a disruptive unwinding of complex loan agreements in those next hours and days the fed insiders would determine the u s response to the looming financial crisis they would also help define the reign of mr bernanke who faced his first major test since taking over as fed chief from the larger than life alan greenspan mr bernankes preparations and his handling of the scare were described by current and former fed insiders private sector officials who deal with the fed and public documents the resulting portrait offers the clearest demonstration so far of how he differs from his predecessor though an introvert like mr greenspan mr bernanke has cultivated a more open and collaborative process striving to draw out all sides of a debate and forcing participants to test their assumptions mr bernanke is also creative in seeking ways to stabilize the financial system beyond the rate cut weapon that mr greenspan wielded more readily "theres more of the economic seminar room of exchanging views and thinking out loud " says vincent reinhart who was an adviser to both men before leaving the fed in september whether mr bernanke made the right calls in the most severe shock to u s financial markets since sept will be clear only in hindsight critics charge that he and his colleagues prior to august underestimated the housing busts magnitude and its potential spillover to markets they say the fed team should have shifted its focus from inflation to the slowing economy far sooner its efforts to restore order through the feds little used discount window have shown limited results today mr bernanke faces another delicate decision on whether to cut interest rates for the second time since credit markets began gyrating markets place high odds on a quarter point cut nonetheless he has dispelled some doubts about the ability of a former academic to run the worlds most powerful central bank in time of crisis should that hold this could have a calming effect on markets that could work to his advantage during future turmoil "i was concerned that his academic strength did not give him the market savvy he needed " says stephen roach asia chairman of morgan stanley "his performance has allayed my concerns " as markets deteriorated in early august mr bernanke kept a low public profile but he canceled plans for a family vacation to charlotte n c and myrtle beach s c and began leaving his home near the u s capitol to arrive at the fed building by a m staying hours or more there was no time to play basketball with the staff as he did in calmer times but occasionally he would exchange his suit for a t shirt and gym shorts to shoot baskets or lift weights alone at the fed gym mr bernanke had been preparing for the crisis for much of his adult life he grew up in a small south carolina town the son of the local drugstore owner he received his ph d in economics from the massachusetts institute of technology in and spent the next years in academia most of it at princeton university he has long taken exception to suggestions that he lacks mr greenspans feel for the markets much of his career he has studied how the financial system and the economy interact in particular during the great depression he told a fed conference in that one of the key mistakes the fed made during the depression was "to allow the financial system to collapse " when he took office he had spent three years as a fed governor under mr greenspan and seven months as chairman of president george w bushs council of economic advisers and was comfortable with his grasp of the economy and monetary policy but he set out systematically to learn the nitty gritty of the feds operations such as its oversight of the financial plumbing that the central bank maintains so banks can move large sums to each other with less time to peruse cutting edge academic papers he tasked a staffer with sending him a selection that he spends a few hours each week reading mr bernanke was no stranger to central bankers but he was a neophyte to the schmoozing of washington and wall street to help him make connections timothy geithner president of the federal reserve bank of new york and a veteran of the clinton treasury arranged breakfasts and lunches at the new york fed between mr bernanke and financial "wise men " guests included citigroup executive and former treasury secretary robert rubin and former j p morgan &amp co chairman dennis weatherstone the talk ranged from the gaping u s trade deficit to the "enormous amount of capital sloshing around the world in perhaps not fully understood instruments " one participant recalled mr bernanke listened carefully but gave away nothing mr bernanke asked an existing fed staff task force to prepare twice a year "financial stability reports " similar to those mr geithner had ordered up from his own staff at the new york fed he also asked for a "crisis manual " which runs several hundred pages and includes details on the feds response to crises such as the penn central railroad collapse an accompanying internal fed web site allows officials to view contact information for counterparts around the world or see how credit derivatives of major banks are behaving the reports and crisis manual contemplated numerous scenarios the failure of a major bank a surge in defaults of a major banks mortgage portfolio the standard recommendation provide lots of cash to the financial system the federal open market committee is the feds key decision making body comprising the feds five current governors in washington and presidents of the regional fed banks the fomc meets about every six weeks to decide on and announce interest rate adjustments when its members gathered around the massive oval table in the boardroom adjacent to mr bernankes office on aug the staff detailed the growing tension in financial markets subprime losses had sunk several hedge funds and forced the german government to bail out a bank investors were shunning all but the safest mortgage backed securities yet several members reported that the economy was still growing moderately despite the housing slump and tight labor markets were putting upward pressure on some wages at the meetings end the committee publicly reiterated its view the main risk to the economy remained inflation that disappointed wall street questions about mr bernankes market savvy resurfaced "it is a credit collapse that is the far greater risk here " brian barish a denver fund manager told the wall street journal at the time "academics look at historical statistics and are rearward looking " on aug mr rubin called mr bernanke the citigroup executive said he suspected a lot of people were telling mr bernanke he should have cut rates yet mr rubin said he thought the fed had done the right thing say people familiar with the call the world changed before markets opened in the u s the next day aug a french bank suspended redemptions in some investment funds citing an inability to value them driving up the demand for cash the european central bank acted fast offering unlimited funds at its target interest rate of it ultimately lent a staggering &lt euro&gt billion that day or &# billion the bernanke brain trust was taken aback by the scale of the ecbs actions and they assembled in his office that thursday afternoon on the phone were mr geithner in cape cod where his vacation had been interrupted and william dudley a former goldman sachs economist who had become the new york feds markets chief eight months earlier also on the line was fed vice chairman donald kohn a year fed veteran mr kohn was mr greenspans closest adviser and is steeped in the history of fed policy making he keeps a binder on his desk of every fomc statement since the first in he gave the first hint a federal funds rate cut was on the table on aug at a conference on housing at a lodge at the foot of the teton mountains in jackson hole wyo speaking to a hall crowded with central bankers and economists he said it is not the feds job to protect investors from their mistakes but market developments "can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account " he said the experience of when a quarter point cut failed to restore confidence and had to be followed with two more argued for a bigger rate cut now mr bernanke and mr kohn called members of the fomc to garner support for a half point cut several regional bank presidents preferred a quarter point cut some members worried about encouraging more speculation later but ultimately all those with a vote all regional bank presidents participate in interest rate deliberations but only five vote supported a half point cut the vote and announcement came on sept wall street expecting a quarter point cut was thrilled the dow jones industrial average soared points and hit a new record days later a week later mr bernanke met representatives of the hedge fund trade association the managed funds association in a session he had requested months earlier to bone up on hedge funds now his focus had changed he zeroed in on the potential for hedge funds to add to market stress were investors asking for big redemptions how were funds valuing their illiquid holdings were brokers asking for more collateral the group participants say assured him that hedge funds had seen nothing unusual and were not making matters worse as the meeting ended an attendee recalled one of the hedge fund representatives said "see you again next year " in an apparent reference to the still fragile state of markets mr bernanke replied "if not sooner " james r hagerty and robin sidel contributed to this article
