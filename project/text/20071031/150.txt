winn dixie faces fight in tough florida market winn dixie stores inc has successfully weathered a bankruptcy and the disaster of new orleans but the grocer may yet face a bigger threat in florida two years after hurricane katrina left dozens of its new orleans supermarkets storm beaten looted and flooded winn dixie has aggressively reopened most of those stores while competitors reeled the chain last year even as it reorganized under bankruptcy protection and closed hundreds of stores elsewhere netted big sales gains in neighborhoods that remained sparsely served having reopened three stores in new orleans in the past month alone winn dixie has replaced wal mart stores inc as the no grocer inside the city limits "we think were gaining momentum in the new orleans area " chief executive peter lynch said mr lynch concedes new orleans accounts for a small fraction of winn dixies business two thirds of the jacksonville fla chains more than stores spanning the southeast are in its home state having closed of its middle market grocery stores under a reorganization completed in november winn dixie is now in third place in florida behind wal mart and publix super markets inc an employee owned chain based in lakeland fla in addition to a fierce pair of competitors winn dixies florida stores are grappling with one of the most troubled consumer markets in the u s where a subprime mortgage mess has ground the local housing market to a halt critics have praised winn dixies nascent turnaround under mr lynch a former albertsons top executive who has cleaned up stores improved service and begun a multiyear store remodeling effort winn dixie shareholders have had a bumpy ride this year having sunk to a week low of &# in november the shares shot up in may on better than expected quarterly margins hitting a week high of &# in early june most of those gains were erased in late august when winn dixie said it expected a loss for the fiscal year ending june this week the company reported a narrower quarterly loss from a year ago showing signs that its turnaround plan is on track yesterday the stock was down cents to &# in p m nasdaq stock market trading aside from store remodeling costs that are expected to erase profit for at least another year much of the anxiety weighing on the shares stemmed from comments on an august conference call when mr lynch noted heightened promotions at wal mart and publix those comments coupled with a lackluster forecast for margins this fall helped to ignite fears that a price war on groceries had begun in florida the fears are misplaced mr lynch says "a lot of construction was going on in florida things started to slow down and weve seen a little bit of softening in sales " he says "all i alluded to in that call is that some competitors overreacted to that this is not a price war and im not seeing that at all " bolstering the argument that competition has slowed in florida and other important markets mr lynch notes that about of winn dixies planned store remodelings over the next year will be "offensive" rather than "defensive " meaning they wont be done in response to a competitors opening a store nearby a remodeled winn dixie store typically generates a sales increase of to during its first year and more modest comparable gains during subsequent years he says stores many of which under previous management had become run down and understaffed after years of cost cuts are being upgraded to be "clean friendly fresh and local " doing a better job of catering to the tastes of their neighborhoods mr lynch says meanwhile he is making the best of the vast majority of stores still waiting to be remodeled improving their meat and produce keeping shelves better stocked and targeting promotions more effectively while the upgrades have helped to raise average transaction sizes store traffic is still down the problem mr lynch says is that shoppers unaware of recent improvements are still driving past winn dixie locations to get to competitors like publix and wal mart which have done a good job of stealing away customers from winn dixie over the past years "we dont have to take half of publixs business back we just have to take a piece of it " mr lynch says "theres plenty of room for winn dixie to exist "
