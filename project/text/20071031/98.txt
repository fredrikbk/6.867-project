news corp tunes asia tv plans after stumble hong kong news corp is hitting the reset button on its strategy in asia the regions largest international television company with channels in more than a dozen countries has been slipping in the ratings in the indian market it once dominated in china efforts to expand its tv business have fallen flat operating profit at the companys asian unit star group ltd dropped nearly in its latest fiscal year analysts estimate news corp chairman rupert murdoch tapped paul aiello chief executive at star group since march to revamp the media giants strategy in the crucial asia market "my goal is to create a new star " says the year old mr aiello who will lay out his plans at an annual industry conference here this week the former investment banker in an interview in his office overlooking hong kongs victoria harbor said he doesnt plan acquisitions or a separate stock market listing for star as had been rumored when he took the post instead he said "our content needed to be refreshed across the board and a lot of the ways that we monetize that content needed to be updated too we have to go local and deep " global media companies see asia as a must chinas advertising market across all media is valued at about &# billion this year while ad spending in india is at nearly &# billion the ad spending in both markets is growing at roughly annually china also has as many as million internet users second only to the u s yet stars recent performance hasnt lived up to this promise "ad revenue still grew but not as strongly as we hoped for " mr aiello said the company doesnt release financial data but media partners asia in hong kong estimates stars operating profit dropped to &# million in its fiscal year from &# million a year earlier a major problem was that the price of producing programming rose faster than stars ad revenue particularly in india mr aiello said a key mistake he said is that star was resting on its laurels in developing markets where it had taken an early lead "you can go for a while without reinvesting in your business and it doesnt show up in your ratings or quarterly results " he said but "the minute you get into harvest mode you are setting yourself up for a big fall " nonetheless star is still profitable in a region where other international tv companies have struggled aside from selling shows to local broadcasters many global media companies have tried to tap the growth in asia by setting up cable or satellite channels often as subsets of u s brands such as viacom inc s mtv asia or time warner inc s cnn international however local tv channels filled with domestic soap operas and talk shows and often protected by local regulators still dominate the ratings in most countries star helped redefine broadcasting in asia after news corp acquired the hong kong based satellite broadcaster for &# million in the s while many other multinationals focused on region wide programming mr murdochs son james who took stars reins in invested in creating local content and raising production standards in india and greater china going head to head with domestic broadcasters star came to dominate indias tv industry with hits such as a hindi language remake of "who wants to be a millionaire " in after years of wooing the chinese government the company won the rights to broadcast its chinese language channel to hotels and parts of southern china but recently stars shine has faded in china in the company attempted to take over the programming of a local chinese broadcaster with national reach regulators halted the move in an ideological crackdown last year news corp sold half its share in phoenix satellite television a chinese language news broadcaster launched as a joint venture with news corp a decade ago to cellphone company china mobile amid what mr murdoch described as general frustration with the market mr aiello an american who has lived in asia for years came to star as president in from morgan stanley where he headed the asian pacific telecom media and technology group he has a doctorate in chinese economic history from the university of cambridge and speaks "enough chinese to get in trouble " he says his plans address very different management challenges in china and india in india the smaller market but by far the larger source of stars revenue mr aiello is hiring and figuring out how to hold on to a host of new talent as well as investing in new programs and local language channels to deepen its reach into a country with dozens of languages star must compete with a growing number of local tv channels as well as other international cable channels through next year indian broadcasters are expected to launch about new channels some run by former executives of star india mr aiello plans new programming for stars indian general entertainment channels including dramas designed to appeal to younger viewers and updates of long running soap operas while most of stars programming is in hindi much of the ad spending on cable tv goes to channels in other languages so in the next months star plans to launch five or six new channels in local languages he said in china the company is waiting for the government to open its doors to foreign tv content mr aiello said no multinational tv company has been able to establish a significant presence in china and many dont even have the limited rights star won in while china wants to turn media into a profitable and globally influential industry beijing doesnt want to give up the communist partys tight grip on the messages contained in the media chinese television regulators didnt respond to a request for comment "channels are probably the most regulated part of the media business in china for the foreseeable future " mr aiello said he plans to push further original production for stars existing chinese channel xing kong but doesnt yet have new programs to announce saying "we have great hopes but we plan according to certain realities " meanwhile news corp is looking beyond tv to new media and mr aiello said he wants star to focus on producing content more broadly the company is still discussing ways to develop content partnerships with china mobile he said in april news corp launched a big online push without star investing in social networking joint venture myspace china it has several local partners but faces a crowded market and a relatively immature online advertising market wendi murdoch rupert murdochs chinese born wife is on the joint ventures board mrs murdochs office declined a request for an interview news corp has agreed to acquire dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal
