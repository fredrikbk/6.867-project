latest ad challenge must record tv time slot battles drew top dollar but dvrs threaten the strategy for decades broadcast networks have pitted their most popular shows against each other scheduling them in the same few time slots in the middle of the week because they can charge much higher ad rates on those days but the age old practice is backfiring in at least one big way observers say that judging by the latest viewership figures from nielsen that programming strategy is fueling the use of digital video recorders which represent a significant threat to networks ad revenue broadcast networks run most of their hottest shows on wednesday and thursday evenings because film companies among others are willing to pay a significant premium for ads that reach viewers before they do their weekend spending but it is those very shows that viewers are increasingly opting to record rather than watch live according to nielsen media research that trend could ultimately force television programmers to rethink how they schedule shows opting to move hit programs into less congested time slots to catch a larger live audience some of the viewing audience now have dvrs that allows them to skip through commercials "we have the most popular shows and we put them against each other by putting them against each other were decreasing their potential commercial audience " says david poltrack executive vice president of research and planning for the cbs network the latest nielsen figures have been eagerly anticipated they represent the first look at how many people actually watch the commercials during the fall primetime season when advertisers spend the most on ads previous nielsen data looked only at viewership of the shows six of the top most recorded shows during the first three weeks of the fall season air on thursday night according to michael mellon senior vice president of research for walt disneys abc one example is abcs hit "greys anatomy " which airs at p m on thursdays some of its audience this season has watched a recording of the show played back on a dvr within a few days the live audience for the premiere of "greys anatomy" dropped by nearly three million viewers compared to last year this year "survivor " which airs on cbs on thursdays at p m dropped more than two million viewers in the to year old demographic for its premiere it had million viewers vs million last year not all shows in those time slots suffered a hit in live viewership take cbss "csi " the main competitor to "greys anatomy" in the p m thursday slot while of "csi" viewers watched it on dvr playback the shows live audience grew by half a million people traditionally advertisers have paid rates based on live viewership of programs but more recently with the rise of dvrs networks and media buyers have called for ratings that also take into account viewership of ads after much back and forth the two sides recently reached a compromise whereby ad rates are based on the number of people that viewed the commercial live plus the number that saw it on dvr in the three days after the show aired that formula is known in the industry as c so far the move away from live viewership and toward playback hasnt affected ad rates for particular shows but many analysts say thats just a matter of time while broadcast network executives privately acknowledge that rising dvr use is a big concern because of its potential to erode ad revenues publicly they point out that when the live and playback numbers for some of these shows are added up the bottom line is that more people are watching the networks say they will find a way to create new revenue sources from those higher numbers "if you look at the greys anatomy live number by itself you go oh my god its a terrible number " says mr mellon of abc "but if you look at the dvr numbers too its the highest rated show on television " for the major broadcast networks live viewership when according to nielsen about of the audience watches commercials is down from last fall in the to age group the demographic advertisers care most about industry analysts predict that trend will only continue dvr penetration has doubled in the past year and for shows on broadcast networks dvr use has nearly tripled only of the audience viewing shows on dvr watches the ads according to nielsen another potential issue for the broadcast networks the most recorded broadcast shows are also the ones with the most upscale viewers those are the programs that are among the most attractive to advertisers the dvr trend also appears to be affecting interest in some of the new shows that the networks had the highest hopes for among the most recorded shows in the first few weeks of the fall season are abcs "private practice" and nbcs "bionic woman " both of which air on wednesday at p m nbc is a unit of general electric "one of the things youve seen this year is there are really no breakouts of new programs in part because people capture the shows they already know they like on dvr and theyre leaving live shows to watch dvr shows " says michael nathanson a senior analyst at sanford bernstein mr nathanson calls this a "logjam" effect stephanie kang contributed to this article
