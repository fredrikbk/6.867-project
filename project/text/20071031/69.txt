in baghdad neighborhood a tale of shifting fortunes baghdad in many neighborhoods across the iraqi capital shiite muslims have defeated their sunni cousins in the civil war thats raged here over the past two years shiites marginalized under saddam hussein have been able to seize real estate businesses and municipal services from sunnis a mafia like network of shiite militias has engineered the takeover of entire neighborhoods of the members on baghdads city council only one is sunni the police are almost entirely shia the central government here says the violence is winding down and the u s military points out that civilian deaths have declined recently but a new quieter chapter of the civil war is unfolding shiite groups are trying to consolidate their on the ground gains and push into neighborhoods that have so far eluded their control the sunnis pressed into a corner are looking for new ways to fight back in some cases theyve joined their former american enemies as allies nowhere is this dynamic more evident than in the citys sayidia section a majority sunni enclave where sunnis and shiites had lived in relative peace while other pockets of sunni resistance remain this district of has emerged as the biggest theater in the battle against shiite militants in february a white sedan swerved and flipped over in front of riyad obaidis home in sayidia the passengers clambered out and ran hearing a tapping sound mr obaidi approached the car and opened the trunk a hog tied and terrified elderly sunni man tumbled out shiite gunmen had just killed the mans son the captive said and packed the father off for a bumpy ride to an almost certain death mr obaidi a sunni himself had just fled to sayidia after shiite militias overran his old neighborhood shocked by the mans story he decided to join a local band of sunni fighters "when sunnis were displaced from other areas sayidia became the most important place for us " he says shiite forces now control more than half of baghdads neighborhoods shiite arabs comprise roughly of iraqs total population the remaining are split between sunni arabs and kurds plus a few smaller minority groups under saddam hussein sayidia almost sunni was home to many ranking military officers and educated elite well off professionals lived here too its shopping streets were among the best in the capital "you used to see castles not just houses with swimming pools it was a very rich area " says abu ibrahim a dentist who used to live there karim obaidi riyad obaidis brother and a colonel in mr husseins air force remembers the fall of baghdad with remorse "it was the first time in my life that i cried " karim recalls the americans disbanded the iraqi army and the veteran fighter pilot took off his uniform came back home to sayidia and joined the anti american resistance other unemployed military officers from the area joined the insurgency but the neighborhood itself remained relatively peaceful sayidia still held traces of its old affluence as late as last october shops were open people were trimming hedges in front of their homes and trash was collected on time but all around the district other neighborhoods were falling under the sway of shiite militants the broader municipal area that includes sayidia known as west rashid is home to some residents or about one fifth of baghdads total population american officers stationed here have watched as shiite militias made steady inroads "within west rashid the shia have gained a lot of neighborhoods that werent shia in " says u s army maj john cross reconciliation is crucial to making iraq a functioning state and a key condition for the eventual withdrawal of u s troops but as baghdads few mixed areas yield to shiite forces that goal becomes harder to achieve "if communities and their leaders can come together in mixed neighborhoods and hammer out some understandings thats critical " says ryan crocker the u s ambassador to iraq riyad obaidi used to manage some small shops in a mixed neighborhood next to sayidia shopkeepers paid him rent but when his leases came up for renewal local shiite militants muscled him out and told him to leave the area he says around the same time another obaidi brother who ran a parking lot nearby was strangled with a rubber cord mr obaidi got the message and fled to sayidia where his brother the colonel lived it was fast becoming the only safe haven for sunnis in west rashid things werent that way for long shiite militants started infiltrating sayidia from adjacent areas under their control according to u s military officials their movements were often aided by the shiite dominated iraqi police "we were surrounded " says omar mohammed a local sunni resident late last year the iraqi police started setting up a maze of checkpoints throughout sayidia shiite militants would often be lurking nearby reports of kidnappings of sunnis in the vicinity of checkpoints started piling up in the spring according to u s officers and local sunni activists in one recent incident plainclothes gunmen ambushed a car carrying two sunni political activists after police pulled them over at a checkpoint the gunmen shot at the ground and then aimed their fire at the two sunnis according to an american account of the incident the two men managed to get away with minor gunshot wounds gen abdul karim khalaf a spokesman for the interior ministry says the accusations that the police are working with shiite militants are unsubstantiated "the police forces represent the government and the government doesnt support one side against the other " he says shiite forces also targeted basic services in the neighborhood according to u s military officials electricity lines were cut water delivery became erratic trash collectors were murdered sunni shop owners were ordered to close down shiite gunmen raided sunni mosques last month only one of mosques remained open sunnis started to leave sayidia house rents once among the highest in baghdad plummeted but some sunni residents also started fighting back mr obaidi the air force colonel joined a ragtag sunni militia that started challenging shiite gunmen battling it out with them in the streets his brother riyad shocked by the man he found in the trunk of the car joined him "almost every night we fought " says riyad gunfire became so frequent and indiscriminate that local resident abu hassan observed that fronds of a palm tree in front of his house had become shredded by bullets still shiite militants gained ground and a new band of combatants entered the fray early this year extremist fighters from al qaeda in iraq a fundamentalist sunni group known for slaughtering shiites al qaeda fighters trickled into sayidia through a neighboring enclave called dora just east of sayidia dora is one of the last exclusively sunni parts of baghdad and it opens out onto sunni controlled belts that wind along the outskirts of the iraqi capital dora is home to battle hardened sunni militants and gunfire aimed at american patrols crackles throughout the sprawling district sayidias desperate sunnis were initially happy to see the new fighters hoping they would help fend off the shiite onslaught "the sunnis had no choice but to receive al qaeda because nobody else was protecting them" says mr ibrahim the sayidia dentist instead the sunni extremists embarked on a simple but brutal strategy kill any shiite they could get their hands on a peaceful shiite population had always resided in the neighborhood they were now targets ali al ameri a shiite lost two brothers in sayidias increasingly chaotic clashes one worked as a carpenter and was gunned down in his shop the other went to check on a malfunctioning electricity generator and disappeared the murder rate in sayidia went through the roof sayidias sunnis who initially tolerated al qaeda soon realized the group had no interest in protecting them only a desire to kill shiites far from being any sort of ally al qaeda was living up to its reputation for inciting violence sayidias sunni residents regrouped recruited by a major sunni political party some sunni fighters joined an ad hoc police unit that would provide a counterweight to the neighborhoods shiite dominated cops the americans patrolling sayidia desperate for a solution went along with the plan they screened applicants and helped finance the unit paying between &# to &# a month to each volunteer both obaidi brothers passed muster and joined the force one morning last month a dozen sunni volunteers including the obaidi brothers shared a checkpoint with a regular police unit the joint watch was tense with the shiite police heckling the sunni outfit "make sure you shave your beards so you look like soldiers not like men from a mosque " a shiite officer teased a huddle of sunni volunteers most of whom were clean shaven local sunnis who had grown so terrified of the checkpoints that many procured fake ids with shia sounding names were happy to see sunni volunteers on the streets the new sunni presence enraged nahil al musawi a prominent shiite cleric and a member of the baghdad city council hes not originally from sayidia but chose to rent a house in the neighborhood and he started leading prayers at a local shiite mosque mr al musawi and his supporters accused the sunni volunteers of burning shia shops and houses and complained to the central government the americans who closely monitor the new force say they have no evidence the sunni guards have done anything improper early this month the iraqi government issued an order banning the sunni battalion from the streets "it was like a punch in the gut to get that order " says maj cross shiite militants with their sophisticated roadside bombs pose as much of a threat to american lives as the most battle hardened sunni insurgents under pressure from the iraqi government the u s is now trying to recruit some shia volunteers into the force so that it can be allowed back on the streets mr al musawi is insisting that the group include shiites not just sunnis but the americans scored their own small victory theyve repeatedly complained to the iraqi government that sayidias official shia dominated police unit has been harassing local sunnis last month the government replaced the unit with an iraqi army battalion though also almost exclusively shia it is far less sectarian than the old guard according to local residents and u s troops in the area mr al musawi the shiite cleric has pushed the transformation of sayidia in other ways in early september he convened a meeting of what he said were displaced sayidia residents at the local police headquarters he told american military officials that his meeting was an attempt at reconciliation between sunnis and shiites the room that day was filled with over a hundred people but american officers who attended noticed there were almost no sunnis in the room a fact mr al musawi doesnt deny a few days later workmen lifted concrete barriers from an approach road to a residential block in the neighborhood and two dozen shiite families who had attended the meeting drove through the breach panic spread among sunni residents as plainclothes gunmen went door to door ordering sunnis to vacate their houses u s officers rushed to the scene most of the new shia arrivals couldnt produce titles to homes they claimed were theirs so the americans turned them back fingering red prayer beads on a recent day the black turbaned mr al musawi says that sayidia had always been a majority shia area "most people who suffered in sayidia are shia " he says
