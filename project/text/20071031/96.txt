mukasey declines to say if waterboarding is illegal justice nominee refers to practice as repugnant washington though the support of several important senators is on the line attorney general nominee michael mukasey declined to say if he considers an interrogation technique that simulates drowning to be torture and therefore illegal though he called the procedure "repugnant " in a letter responding to questions from democrats on the senate judiciary committee mr mukasey promised to review the interrogation methods used by the government to ensure they comply with the law adding that if he finds anything illegal he would "rescind or correct any legal opinion of the department of justice that supports use of the technique " a white house official defended the response provided by mr mukasey because "he has not been briefed on classified programs hes a judge and as any good judge knows you need to have facts to make determinations " the response appears to fall short of demands by prominent democrats and republicans who have said the technique known as waterboarding is torture and called for mr mukasey a former federal judge to repudiate the practice as illegal some including sens lindsay graham r s c and patrick leahy d vt chairman of the judiciary panel suggested their support for his nomination depended on his response to the waterboarding question "if he does not believe that waterboarding is illegal then that would really put doubts in my own mind because i dont think you have to have a lot of knowledge about the law to understand this technique violates" laws against torture sen graham said in a broadcast interview on sunday yesterday after reviewing mr mukaseys letter sen graham was quoted by the associated press as saying that he wanted to raise more issues with mr mukasey in private but that "im favorably inclined to support him " mr leahy who has been criticized by republicans for delaying a vote on mr mukasey said he would consult with colleagues before deciding what to do next "i remain very concerned that judge mukasey finds himself unable to state unequivocally that waterboarding is illegal and below the standards and values of the united states i await his response to other written questions and letters from republican and democratic senators that were sent to him last week " he said mr mukasey a former federal judge from new york initially thought to be a shoo in for confirmation has gotten tougher treatment from some democrats and republicans chiefly because of his answers to questions about torture and government surveillance programs he likely still has enough support to win confirmation in a wider senate vote though he first has to win approval in the senate judiciary panel where support is shakier at issue in the dispute over torture are legal opinions written by the justice department after the sept attacks that underpinned the bush administrations strategies in response to terrorism the legal opinions allowed "enhanced" interrogation techniques and gave justification for the president to withhold protections guaranteed by the geneva convention from some terror suspects under pressure from congress and the courts mr bush backed off his claims to broad powers and promised geneva convention protections for all terror detainees some critics of the administration have claimed that the earlier legal opinions allowed tactics including waterboarding deemed by some to constitute torture the white house has said it doesnt allow torture but has refused to provide details of techniques used now or in the past the administration claims such information would harm national security mr mukasey in his letter reiterated that presidents are bound by constitutional and statutory restrictions that dont allow them to order exceptions to laws banning torture but he expressed concern that any "uninformed" answer he gives to questions from congress during confirmation could present interrogators "with a perceived threat that any conduct of theirs past or present that was based on authorizations supported by the department of justice could place them in personal legal jeopardy " john d mckinnon contributed to this article
