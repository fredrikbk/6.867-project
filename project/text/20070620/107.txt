russian opening a chess champion unites disparate critics of putin kasparov tries to turn kremlins crackdowns to political advantage as president vladimir putin gathered with european leaders for a summit in the southern russia city of samara last month garry kasparov prepared to lead a march of his opposition group nearby the former world chess champion got no farther than the check in counter at a moscow airport two blue uniformed security agents confiscated his passport saying they suspected his ticket to samara was a fake detained he shifted strategy pacing between the duty free shop and an irish pub he used his cellphone to call reporters reports of his plight trickled down to samara at the summit meeting news conference german chancellor angela merkel chastised mr putin for restricting demonstrators visibly agitated mr putin dismissed mr kasparov and his allies as "marginals " russian state television largely blacks out mr kasparovs movement harshly criticizing the putin government yet thanks in part to his deft handling of the kremlins violent crackdowns on rallies the onetime chess champion has improbably reinvented himself as mr putins pre eminent opposition hes done so by exploiting a crack in mr putins controlled political system the kremlin channels dissent into parties that limit their criticism to lower level officials and hounds any party that tries to run without kremlin approval there remains a reservoir of angry but muffled voices mr kasparov as a celebrity who refuses to shut up has managed to unify them to some degree "kasparov was the first to understand that its impossible to work within the political system it only helps the kremlin " says viktor shenderovich a satirist and writer who has joined his anti putin coalition "thats why they call him an extremist " whether mr kasparov can parlay russians unhappiness over government crackdowns on dissent into a political career is another matter mr kasparov who was once honored by a think tank tied to the top of the u s security establishment plays into dark kremlin warnings about supposed american plans to mount a ukraine style democratic revolution in russia his crazy quilt coalition underlines how hard it will be for critics to mount a serious challenge when russia picks a new president next year mr kasparov is one of four leaders of the opposition coalition called the other russia some members complain he is pushing too fast toward a collision with the authorities and fractures are forming over whom to run for president the coalition includes nationalists communists human rights activists free market liberals and anarchist bibliophiles groups whose main thing in common is that the regime shunts them aside they pose little apparent threat to a president who has approval ratings after eight years of economic recovery and relative political stability but mr putin isnt eligible to run again in the coalition has better luck getting attention outside russia than in mr kasparov met with president bush early this month at a democracy conference in prague within russia organizers must rely on word of mouth and the internet to spread news of their political rallies married three times the year old has lately shuttled between moscow and new york his spokesman says mr kasparovs wife for security reasons has been living in new york since october when she gave birth to their daughter in moscow mr kasparov lives on a back street with his mother who schedules his appointments and coaches him in interviews long before entering politics mr kasparov tangled with soviet sports authorities as an upstart chess player born in soviet azerbaijan to an armenian mother and a jewish father he never found a comfortable place in the communist establishment born garry weinstein he took his mothers armenian sounding last name kasparyan after his father died later he changed it to the more russian form kasparov prodded by his mother mr kasparov rose to become a chess grandmaster at by after trouncing opponents at home and abroad he was the challenger to anatoly karpov then the world champion and a revered figure in the soviet union they were a contrast one chess writer gabriel schoenfeld likened mr kasparov to dancer mikhail baryshnikov calling his game "defiantly romantic" and full of bold forays and risk taking the writer said mr karpov years older played an apparatchik like game of positional warfare mr kasparov lost the first few games of their match but then dug in and began to stalemate mr karpov who became exhausted after months of playing the world chess federations chief canceled the match at a new one the next year mr kasparov won and became the youngest world champion at the age of previously silent on politics he began to lash out at the soviet system which he called rotten beyond redemption his critique made him a darling of anti communists in the u s the center for security policy a think tank advocating world peace through u s strength gave mr kasparov its keeper of the flame award in and put him on its advisory board many members of which were former pentagon officials mr kasparov says he accepted the award but nobody ever told him he was a member of the board and he never attended any meetings he says he had his name removed from the think tanks web site when political foes began to raise the issue mr kasparovs anti communist views put him in sync with what came to be called neo conservatism in the u s he became a contributing editor to the wall street journals editorial page after the first gulf war in he bemoaned washingtons failure to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq nato intervention against ethnic cleansing in kosovo denounced in russia as u s aggression won his praise after the sept terrorist attacks mr kasparov wrote that the u s should pursue its enemies around the middle east besides baghdad "we must also have plans for tehran and damascus not to mention riyadh " in russia mr kasparov initially welcomed mr putins ascent to power in predicting he would bring to power a new generation of pragmatic politicians but a year later saying he had been mistaken mr kasparov decried the new presidents revival of the soviet national anthem invasion of chechnya and crackdown on a tv network that criticized the chechen war throughout he continued his chess writing books giving speeches and winning tournaments that made him rich he retired from chess in having "done all i wanted to do" in the game he says politics in russia where the kremlin had all but silenced critics was more of a challenge for two years mr kasparov wandered the political wilderness touring the provinces to deliver speeches few heard in southern russia he was spattered by pro kremlin youths throwing ketchup covered eggs in moscow a young man hit him on the head with a chess board the most prominent opposition figure at the time was mikhail kasyanov a former prime minister fired by mr putin in mr kasyanov was stymied in his efforts to work within the system his speeches muffled by hecklers and unexplained microphone blackouts mr kasparov took a gamble and reached out to more radical critics he struck an alliance early last year with an avant garde writer eduard limonov head of something called the national bolshevik party known for occupying federal buildings and throwing food at officials it has a flag combining soviet and nazi symbols the alliance alarmed veterans of the liberal opposition "kasparov is a very brave man but a naive man and what he is doing now is very dangerous " says grigory yavlinsky leader of yabloko a party long in opposition to the kremlin the other russia held its first demonstration at a moscow square in december police arrested hundreds who tried to reach the site from outside moscow organizers had to cancel plans to march down a thoroughfare to the kremlin after thousands of police in riot gear cornered the protesters with metal barriers trucks and water cannons in other cities authorities denied mr kasparovs group permits and beat protesters at a moscow rally in april police beat and arrested dozens of demonstrators they pulled mr kasparov from a cafe but he escaped arrest when his bodyguards wrestled him free the violence covered in the western media and shown in russia as well cemented mr kasparovs status as the most visible leader of the opposition polls showed widespread disapproval by russians of the violent suppression of rallies recent crackdowns have been less brutal as authorities have turned to detaining and intimidating organizers before the marches instead of beating participants after they hit the streets in the runup to this decembers parliamentary voting and next marchs presidential vote fractures are opening in the coalition one strain involves whom to back for president mr kasyanov the fired former prime minister has declared he will run but at least for now mr kasparov is backing viktor gerashchenko a former chairman of the central bank some kasparov allies fear mr gerashchenko has neither the charisma nor energy to challenge mr putins still unnamed choice as successor in the west mr gerashchenko was blamed for a ruble crash but mr kasparov believes the former soviet official can help lure the votes of communists mr kasparov says he wont declare himself as a candidate because doing so would spoil his role as mediator of the delicate coalition "they need someone to bring people together " he says "and i am a well known man who cannot be easily shut up " the coalition has drawn in elements of other political parties a former top putin economic adviser andrei illarionov has joined as has a left wing economist mikhail delyagin the st petersburg branch of the yabloko opposition party has joined coalition demonstrations rejecting orders of their leader mr yavlinsky mr kasparovs most active ally lately appears to be with mr limonov whose followers have been a hard bitten core for the street demonstrations earlier this year mr limonovs party was banned under a new anti extremism law more than three dozen members are in jail on various charges before the planned demonstration at the samara summit conference last month messrs limonov and kasparov planned to take the same flight to samara mr limonov arrived at the moscow airport at the same time as mr kasparov dressed in black and with a handful of burly party members with buzz cuts as he and mr kasparov stepped to the ticket counter a major from russias security service took their passports and said there was a problem with their tickets he told them to sit in an upstairs waiting lounge as the hours ticked by it became clear the officers were going to keep them waiting until all flights to samara had left mr kasparov argued with the guards then started talking to reporters on his cellphone "the europeans must stop being buddies with putin " he told one reporter "they must recognize that he is head of an authoritarian state " mr limonov paced pulled at his goatee and scowled "i used to yell and get angry but i have been in politics for years now and i got sick of it " he said "i like traveling with garry because he does all the yelling and explains to the stupid foreign reporters the same things over and over " after the last flight to samara left the security officers let the two go mr kasparov held another impromptu news conference then rode home with his bodyguards his mother had a late lunch waiting a traditional armenian meal of dolma soup and vegetables mr kasparov ate little as he took more calls from reporters his mother interrupted him for an urgent interview on a local radio station "garry come over here " she said holding up the phone in a corner of the living room "youre on in seconds " mr kasparov walked over and took the phone "now dont speak too fast and speak simply " his mother said the interview started and she said "slow down garry dont get excited "
