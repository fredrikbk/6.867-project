the evening wrap rewriting the books online edition esperanto never really caught on as an international language but regulators in washington may haven taken steps that will move the world closer to adopting international accounting standards the securities and exchange commission voted today to proceed with a plan to allow foreign companies to use international accounting standards when reporting financial results in the u s eliminating the need for overseas firms to convert their results to comply with generally accepted accounting principles known by the rhymes with nap acronym gaap regulators opened the proposal to public comment for a period of days and after that window is shut they will gather for another vote on whether the shift should take effect the move seems certain to win applause from overseas companies forced to fork over a bundle to make their income statements fit for u s consumption tossing out the need to maintain twin sets of books will make it cheaper for foreign companies to list their shares on american stock markets the rules changes wouldnt be a free lunch many non u s firms currently file only semiannual reports to regulators and investors but under this proposal they would have to spend to roll out their numbers every quarter as american companies must still amid fear that heavy regulatory burdens are leeching business from u s markets the agency believes the shift will be welcomed sec commissioner paul atkins said "eliminating reconciliation could help to make u s markets more attractive to foreign companies " right now the proposal isnt a two way street companies in the u s will still be required to report their results under those old generally accepted accounting guidelines but todays developments may set the stage for gaap to fall into a gap the sec is expected later this summer to raise the question of whether to let u s companies use international accounting standards by issuing a so called concept release which is often a prelude to a change in the rules and that may yet lead to even more dramatic changes to the financial statements that analysts and investors scrutinize well sometimes when deciding whether they should buy a companys shares one possible result is that net income the holy bottom line would become a vestige of the past with companies urged to break out results from various corporate activities that could befuddle those investors who automatically skip down to the net income line but the keepers of the rules believe the changes being chewed over will provide investors with more illuminating information into a companys health as the world inches down the road to eventually adopting a global set of accounting conventions the secs move comes amid a broader push toward so called principles based financial regulations there has been an enormous backlash against the requirements thrust on companies by the post enron sarbanes oxley corporate reforms and those who would like to see some of the laws more burdensome rules rolled back say it has made american markets a less desirable destination for foreign companies looking to raise money in the capital markets treasury secretary henry paulson has been leading the charge toward a more principles based regime but so far the push on competitiveness has been more of an exercise in appointing committees than in actually changing rules and with financial markets in america apparently in rather good shape the dow jones industrial average has risen almost on the year and blackstone group is preparing one of the

isolationism this is not the time to retreat from the principles which have made america so strong and competitive " mr paulson said he said that reforms adopted by the imf to its economic
