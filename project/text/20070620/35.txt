emerging market debt dance j p morgan index loses dominance other gauges rise as the world of emerging market debt rapidly expands and risk premiums run at record tight levels investors in the asset class are shifting among benchmark indexes to better track changing dimensions as a result the traditional benchmark for emerging market sovereign debt j p morgans emerging markets bond index plus has seen its influence wane as outstanding sovereign dollar denominated debt has shriveled in the past three years the bank said in a recent report the embi plus has been overtaken in popularity by the embi global diversified index which includes a broader range of issuers risk premiums on this index widened percentage point yesterday to percentage points over treasurys but even that index may not stand a chance against the most rapidly growing gauge of emerging market debt issuance the banks local currency indexes known as the global bond index emerging markets series according to joyce chang global head of emerging markets research at j p morgan chase &amp co the debt stock for the embi whether global or global diversified amounts to &# billion whereas the local currency bond index launched just two years ago is now worth more than &# billion and is growing to a year "the amount of money benchmarked against it has tripled over the last year to &# billion " she noted as j p morgan highlighted in its report investors are seeking benchmarks that represent a fast growing and maturing world of emerging market debt the asset class has expanded far beyond the brady bonds that used to be the bulk of the category which are now virtually extinct ms chang says "the traditional index has outlasted its usefulness given the changes in the field more generally " said gary kleiman a senior partner at kleiman international consultants an emerging markets consulting firm based in washington ms chang noted the embi plus is still the most frequently quoted "because it has the most longstanding following " and as some people still benchmark off it it is unlikely to be phased out still the local currency index "is capturing the trend in the market " she said that is because of limited emerging market sovereign dollar debt issuance governments foreign debt repurchases and their interest in developing local capital markets moreover record amounts of investor cash has been pouring into the asset class with half of that going into local markets investors exposure to emerging market corporate debt has also grown sharply from in march to in april this year and is expected to hit by the end of the year half of all allocations to emerging market debt are going into local currencies ms chang said abigail mckenna a portfolio manager at morgan stanley investment management which has &# billion in emerging market debt said her firm defers to client preferences on which benchmark they would like to use but she too has noted a shift toward the local currency index "its evolving as more managers and clients have local currency denominated emerging market debt mandates " ms mckenna said treasurys rise again on soft economic data treasury bond prices enjoyed their
