the prison poets of guantanamo find a publisher military security clears after checking for code whats lost in translation inmates at the u s military prison at guantanamo bay cuba used pebbles to scratch messages into the foam cups they got with their meals when the guards werent looking they passed the cups from cell to cell it was a crude but effective way of communicating the prisoners werent passing along escape plans or information about future terrorist attacks they were sending one another poems for years the u s military refused to declassify the poems arguing that inmates could use the works to pass coded messages to other militants outside but the military relaxed the ban recently and cleared poems by prisoners for public release an page anthology titled "poems from guantanamo the detainees speak" will be published in august by the university of iowa press giving readers an unusual glimpse into the emotional lives of the largely nameless and faceless prisoners there "when i heard pigeons cooing in the trees hot tears covered my face " sami al haj wrote in one poem the al jazeera cameraman has been held at guantanamo bay since on suspicion of aiding islamic militants "when the lark chirped my thoughts composed a message for my son " he went on the collection translated from arabic was compiled by marc falkoff a defense lawyer with a literary bent mr falkoff who got a ph d in english before he went to law school represents yemeni prisoners at guantanamo bay and he dedicated the book to his clients describing them in the inscription as "my friends inside the wire " the approximately prisoners at guantanamo are being held indefinitely just two have been charged with crimes military officials are dismissive of the inmates poetry which they say is aimed at garnering public sympathy "while a few detainees at guantanamo bay have made efforts to author what they claim to be poetry given the nature of their writings they have seemingly not done so for the sake of art " says cmdr j d gordon a defense department spokesman "they have attempted to use this medium as merely another tool in their battle of ideas against western democracies " mr falkoffs involvement with guantanamo bay began in june shortly after the landmark supreme court decision in the case of rasul v bush gave guantanamo bay inmates the right to challenge their detentions in federal courts he has since made visits to the prison he has also traveled to yemen to interview his clients relatives and friends in the summer of he received a poem with a religious theme from one of his clients abdulsalam ali abdulrahman al hela a few weeks later a second client adnan farhan abdul latif sent him a poem called "the shout of death " both men are accused of belonging to al qaeda the two had included the poems in their regular letters to mr falkoff which are by military regulation first sent to a government facility near washington to be reviewed by security officials the two poems remain classified intrigued mr falkoff emailed other guantanamo bay lawyers to ask whether any of them had clients who wrote poems they did mr falkoff began putting together his collection writing poetry was both difficult and dangerous for the prisoners who werent given pens or paper until some former inmates say they used dabs of toothpaste as ink other inmates including moazzem begg a british citizen held at guantanamo bay until say they scratched their poems into foam cups with spoons or small stones like most of the approximately inmates freed so far mr begg was never charged with a crime any poem found by the american prison guards was confiscated and usually destroyed the former prisoners say according to mr falkoff most of the poetry he is aware of was written by prisoners who had not written poetry before being arrested the obstacles meant that prisoners like mr begg composed their poems without any real hope that they would ever have an audience outside the prison "i never thought my words would leave guantanamo but i wrote them anyway " mr begg said in an email "like a message in a bottle " martin mubanga a british citizen who was released from guantanamo bay in says writing the poetry was a helpful release "you had all of this anger and frustration that would build up and poetry was a way of getting it out of you " says mr mubanga who had been accused of plotting attacks on jewish targets in new york "it was a way of staying sane " many of the poems are explicitly religious beseeching allah to free their authors or relieve the authors loneliness "oh god " writes abdulla thani faris al anazi a double amputee who has been imprisoned since "grant serenity to a heart that beats with oppression and release this prisoner from the tight bonds of confinement " he is accused of being an islamic militant others are sentimental the poetry of osama abu kabir a jordanian relief worker arrested in afghanistan and accused of belonging to al qaeda expresses his dreams of being reunited with his family "to be with my children each a part of me to be with my wife and the ones i love to be with my parents my worlds tenderest hearts " he writes "i dream to be home to be free from this cage " most of the poems carry political messages denouncing the bush administration "america you ride on backs of orphans and terrorize them daily " writes mr haj the al jazeera cameraman accused of supporting al qaeda "i am a captive but the crimes are my captors " u s authorities explained why the military has been slow to declassify the poems in a june letter to one of mr falkoffs colleagues "poetry presents a special risk and dod standards are not to approve the release of any poetry in its original form or language " it said the military says poetry is harder to vet than conventional letters because allusions and imagery in poetry that seem innocent can be used to convey coded messages to other militants the letter told defense lawyers to translate any works they wanted to release publicly into english and then submit the translations to the government for review the strict security arrangements governing anything written by guantanamo bay inmates meant that mr falkoff had to use linguists with secret level security clearances rather than translators who specialize in poetry the resulting translations mr falkoff writes in the book "cannot do justice to the subtlety and cadences of the originals " for the military even some of the translations appeared to go too far mr falkoff says it rejected three of the five translated poems he submitted along with a dozen others submitted by his colleagues cmdr gordon says he doesnt know how many poems were rejected but adds that the military "absolutely" remains concerned that poetry could be used to pass coded messages to other militants
