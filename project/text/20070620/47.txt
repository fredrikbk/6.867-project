happy for the work it is vacation season once again giving occasion for the usual homilies about how europeans are having a much better and healthier time of it than we are when it comes to work youve heard it a thousand times americans "live to work " while europeans "work to live " by almost every measure europeans do work less and relax more than americans according to data from the organization for economic co operation and development americans work more hours each year than the norwegians or the dutch the average retirement age for european men is and its even lower for european women our vacations are pathetically short by comparison the average u s worker takes days of vacation each year less than half that typically taken by the germans days the french days or the italians days why these differences there are two standard explanations neither of which casts americans in a particularly good light first we are emotionally stunted according to time magazine "in the puritanical version of christianity that has always appealed to americans religion comes packaged with the stern message that hard work is good for the soul modern europe has avoided so melancholy a lesson " second we are under the yoke of hard bitten capitalism the london telegraph reports that the heavy u s work effort does not result from a special affinity americans have for work rather it is because we are "terrified of losing our jobs" in a labor environment in which workers have few of the protections europeans enjoy according to either explanation of the high american work effort we would be a lot happier if we could somehow throw off our chains both emotionally and legally and demand shorter work weeks longer vacations and bulletproof tenure until our early retirements a tidy hypothesis to be sure until we look at the facts the truth is that most americans dont feel particularly shackled to begin with an amazingly high percentage of us like our jobs among adults who worked hours a week or more in the general social survey gss found that said they were very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their jobs only said they were not too satisfied or not at all satisfied of course some would argue this statistic must be hiding big differences between people with "good" jobs and those with "bad" jobs presidential candidate john edwards in an argument fit for the french tells us that we are two nations "one america that does the work another america that reaps the reward " no doubt there is great job dissatisfaction among people with low incomes and little education the folks working in factories and on farms the people who sell you socks and serve you lunch right wrong there is no difference at all between those with above and below average incomes nine in are satisfied as are people without college degrees of people who call themselves "working class" are satisfied but even if we are satisfied with our jobs might we still be happier at the beach imagine asking people something like this "if you were to get enough money to live as comfortably as you would like for the rest of your life would you continue to work or would you stop working " certainly a high percentage would answer in the affirmative wrong again in the gss found that number to be less than a third of all workers and once again there is no difference between those at different levels of income or education of working class folks say they would keep working even if they didnt have to for most americans work is a rock solid source of life happiness happy people work more hours each week than unhappy people and work more in their free time as well even more tellingly people with more hours per day to relax outside their jobs are not any happier than those who have less non work time in short the idea that our heavy workloads are lowering our happiness is twaddle obviously there is a point beyond which work is excessive and lowers life quality but within reasonable bounds if happiness is our goal the american formula of hard work appears to function pretty well this may be one reason why americans tend to score better than europeans on most happiness surveys for example according to the international social survey programme across countries of americans are "completely happy" or "very happy" with their lives versus of danes often cited in surveys as the happiest europeans of the french and of germans those sweet five week vacations and hour workweeks dont seem to be stimulating all that much felicite a good old fashioned hour week might be a better option the bottom line is that this year i will not flinch at any mocking european glance as i write emails from the beach or skip the beach entirely for i am happy mr brooks a professor at syracuse universitys maxwell school of public affairs and a visiting scholar at the american enterprise institute is the author of "who really cares" basic books
