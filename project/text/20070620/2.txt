a streetcar named aspire lines aim to revive cities tampa fla as a transportation system this citys &# million streetcar line is a dud since the project opened in its financial losses have exceeded expectations last year ridership declined to its lowest level yet and the vintage system spans only miles between the edge of downtown and a historic district called ybor city "it goes from no place to nowhere " says hillsborough county commissioner brian blair an opponent of the project but proponents say tampas teco line streetcar system has delivered on another front helping to spur development some &# million in residential and retail space is complete along the route most of it in the channel district a once languishing maritime neighborhood with another &# million in development underway and &# billion in the planning stages local officials expect the district to be home to as many as residents within the next decade like stadiums convention centers and aquariums streetcars have emerged as a popular tool in the effort to revitalize downtowns in the u s about a dozen cities from madison wis to miami are planning lines but while research shows that big ticket projects such as ballparks largely fail to spawn economic development evidence is mounting that streetcars are indeed a magnet streetcar systems are slower less expensive and smaller than light rail with cars that carry a maximum of people and the average line miles long the cars are powered by electricity and run on tracks which developers tend to favor because they suggest a sense of permanence unlike bus routes which can be changed overnight in kenosha wis city officials say a two mile line helped generate new residential units and the redevelopment of a acre industrial site into a waterfront park the streetcar line in little rock ark has sparked revitalization of the citys river market and warehouse district in seattle a new &# million streetcar line is scheduled to open in december that will shuttle riders between downtown and south lake union a formerly industrial area that is being redeveloped by microsoft corp billionaire paul allen and in portland ore the poster child for such development officials say the streetcar system has helped bring &# billion in investment within two blocks of its mile line much of it in the hour hub known as the pearl district "its one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city " says richard brandman deputy planning director for metro the portland areas regional government still streetcars face considerable odds because they vie for the same money as transportation projects designed to serve the suburbs this has been particularly true at the federal level where funding has long depended on how quickly projects can move people from one point to another streetcars which average under ten miles per hour are at a distinct disadvantage by contrast light rail moves at to miles per hour congress sought to change the odds in with the creation of small starts a federal transit administration program designed to fund small scale transportation systems including streetcars but streetcar proponents have been largely reluctant to pursue funding under the program saying the fta still favors high speed transit such as buses paul griffo a spokesman for the fta says that both mobility and development factor into the funding of transportation projects but so far small starts has recommended four projects all of them bus rapid transit an emerging transportation alternative in which a bus operates in a designated lane much like subway or light rail with stops about every half mile in the meantime cities have relied on a patchwork of public and private money to help fund their streetcar systems hoping to tap into a demographic shift in which young professional and empty nesters are moving downtown streetcars are especially popular among urban planners because they encourage the sort of density that allows for offices to be developed alongside homes shops and restaurants "streetcars are not designed to save time " says mr blumenauer "theyre designed to change the way neighborhoods are built " while streetcars lack speed and mobility proponents say the role they play in urban development makes them a worthy transportation choice they argue that by helping to draw development to urban areas such as downtowns and by providing a transportation link in those areas streetcars reduce the need for extra lanes of highways to the suburbs and limit the need for cars in and around downtowns in several cities such as san francisco and new orleans streetcars have never gone out of style as transportation systems but many more were shut down following world war ii in favor of buses that was the case in tampa the city once had one of the largest electric streetcar systems in the southeast with well over cars and more than miles of track in the mid s prompted in large part by nostalgia a group calling itself the tampa and ybor city street railway society set about to restore one of tampas derelict streetcars out of that effort evolved a broader downtown redevelopment campaign in which a new streetcar system was proposed linking the citys convention center and the former cigar manufacturing hub of ybor city but county officials saw the focus on downtown as trivial compared with the needs of the larger tampa st petersburg metropolitan area where the majority of million people rely heavily on their cars to get to and from work county leaders such as mr blair formerly a hillsborough area regional transit authority board member ridiculed the &# replica streetcars as costly toys "the concern was the use of public money " says steven polzin a former regional transit authority board member who is a director of public transit research at the university of south floridas center for urban transportation research "tampa area roads are wanting for resources " but the controversy did little to deter development in the channel district a acre stretch of land where the city has agreed to grant tax breaks for developers developers say they were also drawn by the streetcar line fida sirdar president of key developers group llc for example is spending several hundred thousand dollars to build a pedestrian walkway connecting the york station streetcar stop to his place at channelside a &# million unit condominium "its a big plus " he says in may the tampa city council voted to extend the streetcar line by about a third of a mile into downtown using federal money already in hand by linking downtown and the burgeoning channel district officials hope they can transform the streetcar line into more of a commuter system expanding the hours of operation and raising revenue still tampas streetcar line is still largely a tourist attraction drawing riders last year more than half of them out of town visitors a &# million endowment set up to operate the streetcar system for years is losing about &# million a year and tampa mayor pam iorio says she doesnt intend to put more money into the line which the city owns jointly with tampas regional transit authority "somebody is going to have to step up " says ed crawford a spokesman for the regional transit authority "its clear we cant go on this way " jennifer s forsyth contributed to this article
