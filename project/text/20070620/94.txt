powerpoint turns as its creators ponder a dark side to success one of the most elegant most influential and most groaned about pieces of software in the history of computers is years old there wont be a lot of birthday celebrations for powerpoint the program is one the world loves to mock almost as much as it loves to use while powerpoint has served as the metronome for countless crisp presentations it has also allowed an endless expanse of dimwit ideas to be dressed up with graphical respectability and not just in conference rooms but also in the likes of sixth grade book reports and at powerpointsermons com as it happens what might be called the downside of the culture of powerpoint is something that bemuses concerns and occasionally appalls powerpoints two creators as much as it does everyone else robert gaskins was the visionary entrepreneur who in the mid s realized that the huge but largely invisible market for preparing business slides was a perfect match for the coming generation of graphics oriented computers scores of venture capitalists disagreed insisting that text based dos machines would never go away with major programming done by dennis austin an old chum powerpoint for macs came out in later that year microsoft bought the company for &# million its first acquisition and three years later a windows version followed mr gaskins and mr austin now and respectively reflected on powerpoints creation and its current omnipresence in an interview last week they are intensely proud of their technical and strategic successes but to a striking degree they arent the least bit defensive about the criticisms routinely heard of powerpoint in fact the best single source of powerpoint commentary both pro and con including a rich vein of dilbert cartoons can be found at robertgaskins com his personal home page perhaps the most scathing criticism comes from the yale graphics guru edward tufte who says the software "elevates format over content betraying an attitude of commercialism that turns everything into a sales pitch " he even suggested powerpoint played a role in the columbia shuttle disaster as some vital technical news was buried in an otherwise upbeat slide no quarrel from mr gaskins "all the things tufte says are absolutely true people often make very bad use of powerpoint " mr gaskins reminds his questioner that a powerpoint presentation was never supposed to be the entire proposal just a quick summary of something longer and better thought out he cites as an example his original business plan for the program densely argued pages long the dozen or so slides that accompanied it were but the highlights since then he complains "a lot of people in business have given up writing the documents they just write the presentations which are summaries without the detail without the backup a lot of people dont like the intellectual rigor of actually doing the work " one of the problems the men say is that with powerpoint now bundled with office vastly more people have access to the program than the relatively small group of salespeople for which is was intended when video projectors became small and cheap just about every room on earth became powerpoint ready now grade school children turn in book reports via powerpoint the men call that an abomination children they emphatically agree need to think and write in complete paragraphs still the men dont appreciate powerpoint being blamed for crimes it didnt commit mr gaskins studied a vast collection of presentations before designing the program bullet points he says existed long before powerpoint while the two certainly know how to use powerpoint neither consider themselves true power users they dont even know many of the advanced features it has come to sport they also have no patience with cubicle warriors who in the guise of doing actual work spend endless hours fiddling with fonts and they like telling the joke that the best way to paralyze an opposition army is to ship it powerpoint and thus contaminate its decision making something some analysts say has happened at the pentagon both left microsoft in the s and now pursue personal projects mr austin attended every day of last weeks apple developer conference keeping up with the kids while the two agree there is probably room for a powerpoint like program for building high end web sites neither has any desire to create it not being the self promoting type neither of the men are particularly bothered about being much less famous than their creation whenever they do tell a stranger what they did in life they usually hear how much the person cant live without the program if they have a lament its that complaints about powerpoint are usually not about the software but about bad presentations "its just like the printing press " says mr austin "it enabled all sorts of garbage to be printed " as mr gaskins puts it "if they do an inadequate job with powerpoint they would do just as bad using something else " email me at lee gomes wsj com
