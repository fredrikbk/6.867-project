military is urged to build small cheaper satellites washington the u s needs to step up development of small cheap satellites so its forces wont be crippled by a space attack current and former pentagon officials say the defense department opened an office at new mexicos kirtland air force base last month to focus on so called operationally responsive space air force undersecretary ronald sega said the new unit will work with pentagon planners the intelligence community and the air forces space acquisition unit so that space technology can respond quickly as battlefield needs emerge u s officials have worried for years about the militarys dependence on big ticket satellite systems for a wide range of communications and surveillance missions to augment these systems the pentagon has invested in high flying drones such as northrop grumman corp s global hawk along with balloon borne radio relays and other aircraft that carry flying command centers but these backups have neither the world wide coverage of a satellite nor can they fly freely over foreign territory said raytheon co executive brian arnold a retired air force general and former space system weapons buyer "if you start flying a balloon over sovereign territory during peacetime i would argue to you that would be extremely provocative " mr arnold said raytheon has developed a number of demonstration projects intended to show the possibilities of quick response space systems built on a shoe string budget for example the company is designing an imaging sensor called artemis for a coming defense department tactical satellite project general dynamics corp also has technology demonstrators in the works last month the company announced it had completed launch and early orbit checkout for a program called the near field infrared experiment or nfire intended to collect research data for missile defense development efforts mr arnold says small satellites such as these cant completely replace big ticket satellite systems but if the technology can move beyond experimental status it could offer an affordable way to launch upgrades and also provide emergency capabilities if the big spacecraft are disabled by an accident or an attack such worries intensified recently after the chinese tested an antisatellite weapon by destroying one of their older orbiting spacecraft mr arnold says the appeal of antisatellite weapons might decrease if quick replacements were available but for quick response space to take hold the u s may need to increase funding the air forces six year budget plan included just &# million for operationally responsive space with long term funding hovering around &# million per year that means interested companies will have to consider internal investment mr arnold said
