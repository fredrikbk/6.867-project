a cultural conversation with bill james he is the boston red soxs sultan of statistical analysis boston after years on the outside bill james was invited to take a seat at the center of the baseball universe since his hiring by the boston red sox in mr james the statistical oracle and author of the bill james baseball abstracts the team has broken the curse of the bambino won the world series and is currently tearing up the american league as mr james raised on the kansas city athletics is a yankee hater from way back he might be expected to take even more pleasure in the new york teams faltering start to the season but sitting in a restaurant a long fly ball from his bare office in fenway park mr james refuses to revel "who was it who wrote the book they only look dead " mr james asks he also refuses to take credit for the red sox rise "nothing i do leads directly to consequence and if it did i wouldnt tell you " mr james says indirectly its a different story starting in with his first baseball abstract mr james transformed a centurys worth of conventional wisdom and forever altered the way ballplayers are judged applying the scientific method to the game he and a band of amateur analysts who mr james termed sabermetricians for the society for american baseball research attempted to answer through objective statistical analysis what factors led to scoring runs and winning games and which players contributed most to those goals mr james for instance has long held that the ability to get on base was underrated and that the sacrifice bunt was overrated after gaining a wide following among fans his work started to influence at least a few baseball general managers a process chronicled in "moneyball " the best seller by michael lewis about the oakland athletics and general manager billy beane now more than books of his own later mr james has a desk in fenway park and a title senior baseball operations adviser so what does he do for the team "i see it as being my job to ensure as much as i can that we act on the basis of actual evidence " of course if it werent for hope and blind faith interest in the red sox might have dried up years ago as it is the team with its current eight game lead over the yankees has never been more popular and fenway is sold out almost every night as for the curse of the bambino mr james says "i didnt even believe in it before " mr james a rationalist in a church of red blooded true believers takes the long view "in any given season there is an immense amount of luck in who wins the division even if its a lopsided race " he says "people are made very uncomfortable by the notion that our lives are random but there are huge random parts in everything that happens its uncomfortable because its our job to drive the randomness out and make the system work " since mr james was hired by red sox owner john henry in the team has yet to win the division it did however win the world series in beating the yankees in seven games to win the pennant a year earlier the sox lost to the yankees in seven games two years later they had fallen to third place in the american league east what accounts for this years dominance "we think we have a good organization and we thought we had a good organization last august when we couldnt win a game to save our soul " mr james says with "moneyball " mr jamess style of analysis has become associated with relatively poor teams the red sox however are one of the richest "there is a certain backwardness to it yes " he concedes but he adds that boston is "committed to the challenge to figuring out the best way to do things nobody in the organization is traditional " that would include mr james who started writing his abstracts while working as a night watchman at a pork and beans factory in lawrence kan even as his fame grew as a writer mr james says he never imagined working in baseball management unlike theo epstein who interned for major league clubs in college and was hired as the red sox general manager at age mr james says he was never the type to put together a resume and go find a job even today he allows that "there are very good reasons why theo is the gm and i am not " now age mr james says he does better working in an organization than he suspected still even after moving to boston two years ago he spends a lot of time alone "a lot of my friends think that i dont like people the reality is i do like people i just need time to myself to work so i tend to turn off my cellphone " he says with the success of the athletics and of "moneyball " baseball analysts like mr james were given more credit for helping teams draft and trade players more intelligently in time magazine named mr james one of the most influential people in the world inexplicably time dropped him from this years list even as the red sox moved from third place to first go figure mr james is known for claiming that some statistics such as runs batted in are less important than was commonly believed while others like on base percentage are more important both are now conventional wisdom is there some wrongheadedness still in vogue "i do have an answer but i cant tell you what it is i do think we know at least some small things that not everybody in the world knows " even if the analytical tools he helped create are now widely employed mr james says that just as some teams stay richer others can stay smarter "in reality knowledge is a very dynamic universe and what is most valuable is not the body of knowledge but the leading edge of it " mr james does allow that "when a team has resources there is a powerful tendency to solve problems by spending money it is less attractive to experiment " the yankees recent signing of pitcher roger clemens for &# million a season is "probably" an illustration of the idea he says "i have a lot of oddball ideas i always have " mr james says even if some of his ideas once considered odd are now popular his theory on baseball and steroids may or may not be odd but it is certainly not in vogue "i dont know " he says when asked if steroids account for the surge in home runs in the late s "speaking globally the reality is that there are many changes in the game which could cause batting numbers to jump and no one really knows to what extent the increase is a consequence of steroids i strongly suspect that the influence of steroids on hitting numbers is greatly overstated by the public " other factors include ballpark dimensions and bat design "ive never understood why nobody writes about it but the bats are very different now than they were years ago " mr james says with different woods and finishes "barry bondss bats are still different from everybody elses " he notes "people think they understand how to win in baseball much more than they really do " mr james says this is true of the statisticians as much as it is of traditional scouts while "moneyball" treats scouts and analysts as at odds mr james says he learns from the scouts all the time "the scouts see a lot of things that i cant see and some of the things they see i have learned to see but some of the things they see i cant see at all and im not suggesting its not real its just that i cant see it " he says "there is no reason for there to be a conflict the conflict exists only when people think they know more than they do " after a lifetime of studying the game mr james reckons he still has plenty to learn the internationalization of the game is one source of new wisdom he says "one of the great things about the cubans and the japanese is that they develop their own traditions and a lot of the things we think they know they dont necessarily buy into incorporating those other traditions is a source of wealth for baseball and if were smart well do more of it " ichiro suzuki the seattle mariners centerfielder and perennial hits leader is one example "hes a great player while violating rules about how everybody is taught to hit " mr james says orlando "el duque" hernandez the wily cuban born new york mets pitcher is another case in point "we have a set pitching pattern and then you get a guy like el duque doing everything wrong and he beats you its a wonderful object lesson for all of us " mr ackman writes for the journal about sports culture and law
