business too hot for congress to handle the real answer on the blackstone tax rate it may seem strange that congress is making an issue out of stephen schwarzmans tax rate compared with other problems on the national plate this one isnt big even if mr schwarzman and all his private equity colleagues paid taxes like everyone else the increased revenue by my back of the envelope calculations wouldnt pay for a months worth of the iraq war or a weeks worth of medicare still the blackstone group ceos paycheck has become a stunning symbol of our times stunning because most people can scarcely comprehend how a man can earn a half billion dollars a year much less have rod stewart and patti labelle perform at his birthday party stunning because the indiscriminate flood of capital that makes mr schwarzmans riches possible shows no signs of abating and stunning because at for most of his earnings mr schwarzmans tax rate could be less than his chauffeurs but making tax law based on personal anecdote is never a good idea its best to step back and ask do the tax laws governing mr schwarzman make sense lets start with the issue on the table should mr schwarzmans firm be allowed to sell shares to the public without paying corporate tax tax experts tell me that to do this blackstone and fortress before it are taking advantage of a provision in the tax law that permits partnerships to be publicly traded but only if they engage primarily in "passive" activities a sop given two decades ago to oil gas and timber partnerships blackstone claims it qualifies because its investments in the companies it buys are largely passive trouble is thats the exact opposite of the argument blackstone has made to the securities and exchange commission at the sec blackstone argues it is an "active" manager of its portfolio companies because otherwise it would fall under the investment company act which governs mutual funds and imposes various regulatory constraints this sort of regulatory double talk is dubious still as a matter of public policy its fair to ask why should the tax laws discourage private equity firms from going public to do so seems to favor fat cats and big pension funds at the expense of ordinary investors that gets to the underlying issue and the one that has an army of washington lobbyists and law firms billing overtime hours should the "carried interest" typically earned by general partners in private equity funds be taxed as capital gains at a low rate or at the top ordinary income tax rate of again the argument hinges on whether the investment is "passive" or "active " most independent tax experts i spoke with argue that some of mr schwarzmans haul is being paid to him by outside investors as a fee for actively managing their money and therefore should be taxed as ordinary income victor fleischer at the university of illinois college of law argues that mr schwarzmans interest in the funds is in effect a no interest "loan" from outside investors so in addition to the capital gains tax on any appreciation mr schwarzman should also pay ordinary income tax on the interest forgone by those investors the dilemma for congress is that private equity firms arent the only ones caught in this maze all sorts of partnerships including real estate and oil and gas rely on the same tax trick changing the rules makes sense but its effects would reach far beyond private equity if all this seems hopelessly complex there is a simpler solution abolish the lower tax rate on capital gains altogether that would eliminate the carried interest problem ensure that even the fattest of cats pay their fair share and also eliminate the lions share of complexity in todays tax code with the world awash in investment capital legislators could argue theres no need for a tax incentive to encourage more but thats a hornets nest that legislators wont want to touch in the end mr schwarzmans best defense isnt that his current tax treatment makes sense because it doesnt its that any effort to fix the problem will arouse a poisonous swarm of special interests alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
