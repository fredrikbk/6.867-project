ajaxs security software the product made by spectorsoft corp a florida company essentially records everything employees do on their computers what web sites they have visited how long they looked at a site what emails they have sent and more nowadays the greatest risk to company security comes from within security analysts say in the past the threat had been mostly from spammers and hackers these new threats are prompting companies to take their security measures up a notch employers are increasingly relying on advanced software to protect their systems indeed experts see the market for such security systems growing to &# billion by from &# million in even well meaning employees can cause data security problems according to the privacy rights clearinghouse earlier this year the personal information of households including names addresses birthdays and family income ranges were posted on a public internet site several times over a five month period when employees at the u s census

american management association polled companies about their monitoring practices said they monitor web connections up from in and said they also look at email compared with in "monitoring is becoming more prevalent now than it has been " said gartner analyst peter firstbrook adding that both the insider threat and compliance issues are driving the growth "people sending things to themselves or stealing intellectual property is a real concern " there will always be people who try to beat the system that is why analysts say that it is important for businesses to keep up with what is new and pick technology that can monitor filter block access to inappropriate web sites and purge emails and instant messaging systems "you want to monitor your existing technology but you need to stay up on whats new especially if you have a young work force " said nancy flynn executive director of the epolicy institute software supplier clearswift with about &# million in revenue a year sells products that monitor email and internet connections some applications can detect credit card and social security numbers in an email message a spreadsheet or an attached word document others limit accessibility of certain documents to a specific number or group of people "we can help stop the outbound threat " said alyn hockey director of product management at clearswift "the real key thing about our product is that we can actually create policy rules that let people do their job without making security an inhibitor we can encrypt mail according to policy and have different roles and responsibilities for managing the system such as by limiting access to business managers and compliance officers " websense inc with &# million in annual revenue has a leak prevention suite of software that discovers monitors and prevents sensitive data from leaking out of the organization either accidentally or maliciously through common platforms including email instant messages web mail and network printers another vendor californias rpost offers registered email the company with four million enabled users provides a service sponsored by bar associations nationwide that gives legal proof that a message was received and also provides proof of the contents of the message including attachments as an email message is sent from one user to another rpost provides the sender with a registered receipt confirming delivery status and original content sent in the email in addition after a recipient reads an email an "open receipt" is returned to the sender indicating at what time the message was opened this protects the company from litigation because the receipts legally document the content and reception of each message casting aside doubts about who is sending and receiving what important or sensitive information and when "its for correspondence of consequence that the service increases accountability by alerting the receiver that the sender knows that they got the email " said rpost chief executive zafar khan as monitoring technology becomes increasingly sophisticated and widespread some argue that employers should respect their workers privacy "businesses have their concerns and theyre legitimate " said jeremy gruber legal director at the national workrights institute "but what we need is regulation we need to see companies balance their concerns with their employees privacy "
