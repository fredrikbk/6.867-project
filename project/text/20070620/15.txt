business world pork the new green meat al gore among many others deserves a hand for conjuring up the present mood of public acquiescence to legislative proposals aimed at global warming over to you congress whether we face a climate crisis we certainly now face a climate pork crisis we already are paying thrice for washingtons love affair with corn based fuel in the form of higher taxes higher gasoline prices and higher food prices yet because of the prodigious amounts of energy and fertilizer used in its cultivation corn based ethanol provides little or no net reduction in co over the gasoline it displaces big surprise congress is taking advice from farm lobbyists and archer daniels midland not climate scientists and donor groups have plenty more ideas for how congress can shovel money at "alternative energy" and justify it by citing global warming an even bigger pinata are the competing bills to award various companies lucrative "emissions rights " many a candlelit dinner will undoubtedly be held with lobbyists to haggle over which industries to include in this "solution " by now whatever their disagreements about the reality and risks of man made climate change all parties to the climate debate ought to be able to lay down their cudgels long enough to agree on one thing congress needs external help to avoid committing dumb useless costly policy the public says it fears global warming but the public will also make sure nothing done in the name of global warming damages voters lifestyle in a way voters can notice thank heaven for small favors the u s accounts for of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions before the year is over china will become the worlds biggest outputter anything congress does will be at best a gesture and an experiment at worst a special interest blowout and theres every reason to expect the worst a spasm of subsidies mandates and prohibitions better calculated to win campaign donations and snooker voters than to deal rationally with a possible human role in climate change congress after all is a machine for matching pronouncements with policy actions in a way that will get members re elected any relation to desirable policy ends is largely incidental global warming meanwhile is a true conundrum nothing is known with any certainty about the risks we face or whether we can do anything to avoid them whatever we think we understand about climate change is likely to be revised radically in the years ahead worse the finger one day will be pointed at science itself perhaps unfairly for all the political mobilization done in its name given much evidence of earthly cooling and warming in recent millennia all too pat is the intuition that the current trend can be rounded down to a single variable human fossil fuel consumption dont be surprised though the public surely will be when an awkward new trend inevitably appears in the temperature record cooling this wont prove or disprove a warming effect from human co only that many variables feedbacks and chaotic wildcards shape our climate not for the first time washington faces a dangerous meeting of legislative incompetence public simplemindedness and the opportunity for extreme mischief not for the first time it makes sense to appoint a blue ribbon commission to lift policy above everyday horse trading we realize were tempting fate here but such a commission could hardly do worse than congress which brings us to al gore this little pigovian no we dont refer to his new plus size physical presence but to his recent pronouncements suggesting he has become a follower of the late british economist arthur pigou who said tax bads and not goods mr gore advises not only adopting a carbon tax but using it to offset payroll and income taxes we should be taxing carbon not work he says never mind that mr gore just as enthusiastically endorses tradable emissions permits apparently unaware the two proposals are redundant here he revives a valuable idea from the serious environmental literature of the s that of the "double dividend " let this idea frame a new climate commissions marching orders to wit in addressing the speculative and uncertain risks of man made climate change lets make sure we also do some good for the economy that means using a carbon tax to reduce existing distortions in the tax code as resources for the futures richard morgenstern enumerated in a paper "taxes on labor discourage work effort those on savings reduce the pool of capital available for investment and those on investment discourage risk taking " this path is infinitely preferable to the kyoto path not to mention the successor path recently unveiled by president bush of trying to negotiate a climate policy with other major nations a formula more likely to produce connivery in empty gestures and political favor trading than good policy by shifting the tax burden away from work saving and investment the u s would offer other nations an example they could follow out of economic self interest rather than a common vision of sackcloth and ashes such an approach would put consumers and businesses in charge of finding the most efficient ways to reduce carbon output rather than relying on washington to exercise an improbable clairvoyance and probable corruption in picking winning technologies most of all by reducing the dead weight of taxes on labor and capital it would speed the accumulation of wealth and knowledge in society which can only help humanity adapt to whatever challenges it faces in the future
