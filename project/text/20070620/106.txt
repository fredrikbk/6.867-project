rooms and offering professional fitting services other companies including chicos fas inc american eagle outfitters inc and charming shoppes inc s lane bryant have created stand alone lingerie stores the retailers are hoping to steal some thunder from the limited brands inc s victorias secret chain which has dominated fashion lingerie in the u s for many years "lingerie is second to handbags as the fastest growing apparel category so everyone in retail is trying to capitalize on that growth " says marshal cohen chief research analyst with npd group a market research firm based in port washington n y u s retail sales of intimate apparel last year rose to reach &# billion more than double the growth rate in according to npd driving that growth are new technologies and fabrics that allow for such innovations as laser cut seamless bras and the growing fashion appeal of lingerie particularly among young women many younger women today have no compunction about "wearing inner wear as outerwear " npds mr cohen notes for instance allowing colorful bra straps to show without embarrassment that creates a market for lingerie to change with the seasons instead of just being bought as "replenishment " he says the intimate apparel category is appealing to retailers because it has higher profit margins than regular apparel drives store traffic and boosts customer loyalty "if you solve a womans bra needs you have a customer for life " says adrianne shapira an analyst at goldman sachs victorias secret largely created the market for fashionable lingerie in the u s emulating the lingerie market in europe in the columbus ohio limited bought a handful of victorias secret stores and a catalog at a time when most women in the u s owned a few sets of underwear in beige black and white chief executive les wexner envisioned women buying underwear more like they purchased clothing buying more frequently and choosing among a range of colors and styles he improved the quality of victorias secret and toned down racy styles so that they would appeal to mainstream shoppers for much of the last years victorias secret had the market for fashionable lingerie to itself brands sold in department stores such as maidenform vanity fair and bali have typically appealed to different shoppers loyal consumers with more conservative tastes says monica tang retail strategist at kurt salmon associates "the younger more fickle customer has been lured away by victorias secret whose pieces have a fashion component " she says but in the fiscal first quarter ended may limited reported its overall net income fell hurt by profit eroding markdowns and said it expects continued weak sales in its victorias secret division net sales at the lingerie unit rose while same store sales a closely watched measure of revenue from stores open at least a year increased the problems at victorias secret stem in part from recent product launches that didnt make as much of a splash as last

tested three stand alone stores and the results were so good a spokesman says that it plans new stores this year aerie will roll out different lingerie collections throughout the year limited spokesman tom katzenmeyer says the recent sales weakness is "largely self inflicted " during the spring season customers wanted a greater proportion of colorful styles than they had in past years and victorias secret didnt have the right inventory he says in addition weak mall traffic has hurt the brand he says all the new competition certainly isnt helping in february j c penney launched its ambrielle lingerie collection with a series of smoldering ads during the academy awards the company predicts it could become one of the stores private label "power brands " sharen turney chief

brunt penneys vice president and director of brand management "our positioning is totally different from victorias secret " she says "you cant look at anything that they do and say thats not sexy but
