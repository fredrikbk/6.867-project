court against morgan stanley and wachovia securities a unit of wachovia corp allege that the two firms helped fishers former employees use confidential client information to solicit business "the allegations are without merit and we intend to contest them " a morgan stanley spokesman said wachovia declined to comment fisher also wanted brokerage house ubs securities to commit to not hiring former employees or else the firm would pull its trading related business according to people familiar with the matter fisher investments declined to comment about the ubs ag unit in late fisher investments sought damages and a restraining order against william carlson an illinois based former salesman who worked for the firm for more than six years fisher alleged that mr carlson violated his employment contract by soliciting fisher clients and that he stole trade secrets specifically contact information for existing and prospective clients in court documents mr carlson acknowledged contacting fisher clients but said there was nothing improper about doing so in november a federal judge in the u s district court for the northern district of illinois wrote an opinion denying the restraining order against mr carlson saying that portions of fishers employment contract appeared to be unenforceable and that fisher was unlikely to be able to show that its list of clients constituted a trade secret that dispute was settled out of court the fisher spokesman said mr carlson made a payment to the company "for violating his contractual obligation to keep fisher client information confidential " the firm argues that the judges opinion doesnt set a precedent for other disputes in an interview mr carlsons attorney declined to comment on the settlement saying it was subject to a confidentiality agreement he also questioned whether it was appropriate for fisher investments to comment on the settlements terms in light of the confidentiality agreement in court documents filed before the settlement mr carlson had denied that his actions violated his contract last year fisher filed suit against mr casper and his current employer wachovia for allegedly soliciting fisher clients in violation of his employment contract mr casper left fisher after more than five years for a job at citigroup inc s smith barney in october fisher threatened to pull

work elsewhere a spokesman for smith barney declined to comment in early april of this year mr fisher sent letters to an unknown number of individuals in the fisher database who may have come into contact with mr casper including current and former fisher clients as well as people who have never been fisher clients mr caspers attorney says the one page letters say mr casper had broken his employment contract mr fisher "is trying to tar tom casper " says mr caspers attorney robert peterson virtually identical letters were sent regarding at least five former employees in total according to people who have seen the letters the letters were signed by mr fisher according to copies of the letters reviewed by the journal the letter regarding mr casper read in part "the basic issue is would you trust your familys financial future in any regard to someone who could be proven to not live up to his word " it also said "if a person will not live up to his written word to us do you think he will live up to his word written or verbal to you " mr caspers libel suit contends that the allegations are false and that mr fisher sent the letters with the intent that they would "damage caspers reputation " fisher investments didnt respond to a question about the letters or about the allegations in mr caspers countersuit
