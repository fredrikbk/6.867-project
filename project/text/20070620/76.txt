online worlds draw in chinese on any given evening the imaginary land in "fantasy westward journey" has a larger population than the state of maine the million players inhabiting the online game at peak times are building virtual communities complete with markets currencies and even street protests in the picturesque setting of a classic chinese novel netease com inc s "fantasy westward journey " is part of what is fast becoming a national pastime online roleplaying games about million chinese play these games regularly according to estimates from san diego market research firm dfc intelligence in the online gaming business excluding piracy generated about &# billion in revenue in china said dfc which expects that annual take to double by so prevalent is the craze that the chinese government inserted "antiaddiction" restrictions into games to discourage underage players from disappearing wholly into the fantasy worlds u s investors are hooked too as borne out by active trade in american depositary shares of game providers such as netease sohu com the and shanda interactive the latter two which both have market caps of less than &# billion have returns of more than for the year to date most of these issues hardly flinched during the two major selloffs in shanghai this may yet some analysts and companies see further investment opportunities as the companies make the transition to a new revenue gathering model joining other prominent stakeholders in the sector such as cisco systems inc videogame pioneer electronic arts inc recently agreed to pay &# million for a roughly stake in the most observers expect the popularity of the games to endure because they combine socializing and entertainment in a society with limited options for both "in china there are not as many means of entertainment as here in the u s " said c ming zhao a chinese analyst at susquehanna financial group most young chinese people dont own cars or have a lot of expendable income to spend around town mr zhao said "so people use online games to do a lot of social networking for dating people and chatting with friends " he said one u s player of vivendi sas "world of warcraft " licensed in china by the said the game became an obsession for him as he played six hours a day for about years filling as he put it "thousands of hours " "each online world is like a foreign country they have their own currency they have their own culture they have their own social hierarchy " said richard huang who is now a statistics analyst at a risk management company in new york on "wow " mr huang befriended fellow "guild" members with whom he cooperated on complex "raids" where they had to play to one anothers strengths and constantly communicate given the shared responsibilities some guilds were exclusive and vetted applicants as thoroughly as if they were job seekers in the real world he said indeed dfc estimates about chinese people make a living from gathering virtual items and selling them for real money while connections weakened after he quit playing mr huang remains in sporadic touch with some guild buddies all a player needs to enter these worlds is a computer or proximity to one of the myriad internet cafes in china to play chinese buy subscription cards similar to pay phone cards to most games through news agents and other outlets nationwide the cost is about five cents an hour other companies are experimenting with first providing free access to the games then charging players when they buy clothes and other equipment for the characters they create shanda interactive entertainment ltd s successful switch from a subscription model to a "free to play pay for merchandise" model has made it one of the fastest growing and most appealing game companies said mr zhao similarly cdc corp made a dramatic entry to the gaming market with a free to play martial arts game in said ryan jacob founder and portfolio manager of the jacob internet fund where cdc is a "midsize" holding of somewhat less than "its funny you end up getting more players and even if just a small percentage buy items the economics are pretty good " mr jacob said of the free to play model among the most popular items in cdcs game recently were virtual bridal gowns sold on valentines day that attests to both the popularity of this pastime with women and its unique position in the social fabric said cdc spokesman monish bahl in the second half of this year cdc a software and internet portal developer plans to spin off its games unit which licenses titles from other markets and adapts them for china due for release later this year are a free "shoot em up" and a subscription based chinese version of "lord of the rings " shanda was one of the jacob internet funds top holdings in but fears about that companys transition to free gaming a "crowded" marketplace and valuation prompted sale of the position mr jacob said the field will become more cluttered as more gaming start ups go public and share performance becomes "hit driven " for that reason and because of valuations mr jacob prefers internet companies that operate a range of web sites such as those run by sina corp and sohu com inc while sohu com for example stands to gain while when its online roleplaying games are hits its advertising and other businesses would cushion the effects of a flop from his perspective mr zhao says companies that have active research and development arms which invent rather than license games will eventually emerge victorious the chinese gaming market is such a draw that it attracts companies from around the world recently swedish company mindark said it would build a virtual world for the market to accommodate seven million concurrent users only two million shy of the population of sweden itself
