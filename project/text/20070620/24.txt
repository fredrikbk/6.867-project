chip makers recycling becomes side business not long ago used microchip wafers were considered all but worthless sent to landfills or recycling centers but semiconductor makers have found a new home for the millions of wafers they exhaust each year the emerging solar industry amid tight supplies of polysilicon the practice has become a worthwhile side business for chip manufacturers such as texas instruments inc national semiconductor corp freescale semiconductor inc and intel corp these wafers "have been like gold" for the makers of chips over the past couple years said pat callinan president of silicon valley microelectronics inc a firm that buys and sells wafers whereas the chip producers "used to get very little for their wafers " its lately become "a very lucrative business " mr callinan said it doesnt necessarily matter whether the material in question is a broken wafer silicon powder or "pot scrap " it just needs to contain polysilicon the key raw material used to make microchips in electronic devices and solar cells its been an eye opening experience for industry veterans whove seen a radical transformation in their business where until used wafers were little more than a nuisance the catalyst has been the voracious appetite of the solar energy panel manufacturers mike hayden the chief silicon buyer at texas instruments the worlds largest maker of cellphone chips suddenly found himself slammed with offers a few years ago "people started bombarding me to find out where our scrap was going " he said "thats when i realized the stuff was getting valuable " ti no longer stuffs used test wafers into gallon drums for transfer to a recycling center in the dallas area paying waste removal fees in the process there were occasions when as mr hayden recalled scrap collectors were willing to ante up &# per drum today the company sells almost all of its wafers to solar companies in germany japan hong kong and elsewhere this year such sales will generate &# million in revenue according to the companys forecast freescale used to grind up test wafers selling the crushed silicon for cents a pound to metals firms said spokesman glaston ford it had largely halted that practice by in the face of demand from solar firms freescale has been selling inch wafers for &# apiece and inch wafers for &# mr ford said the appetite for the wafers stems from a supply crunch in the global polysilicon market spurred by the growth of the solar energy industry which uses polysilicon in the manufacture of cells for panels that convert sunlight to electricity "we have a stable of people in line to buy the used wafers " said jim kritzer a purchasing manager at national semiconductor "we bid the stuff "
