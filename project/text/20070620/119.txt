two big funds at bear stearns face shutdown as rescue plan falters amid subprime woes merrill asserts claims two big hedge funds at bear stearns cos were close to being shut down last night as a rescue plan developed over several days fell apart in a drama that could have wide ranging consequences for wall street and investors merrill lynch &amp co one of the hedge funds lenders said it would move to seize collateral much of it mortgage backed debt from the two funds and sell it according to documents reviewed by the wall street journal at the same time the funds managers worked with a handful of other key lenders including goldman sachs group inc and bank of america corp to pay off the funds &# billion in loans according to a person familiar with the matter as of a few weeks ago the two bear stearns hedge funds held more than &# billion of investments mostly in complex securities made up of bonds backed by subprime mortgages the relatively risky home loans made to borrowers with troubled credit histories in recent weeks however the firms high grade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage fund and high grade structured credit strategies fund have been besieged by investors and lenders trying to recover their money as the value of the funds underlying bonds fell sharply the bear stearns hedge funds problems are emblematic of the widening fallout from the nations housing downturn which just a few weeks ago seemed to be stabilizing during the housing boom in the first half of the decade lenders issued record volumes of mortgages often on very generous terms then packaged those mortgages into bonds and sold them off reducing their exposure to any loans that went bad since wall street has created more than &# trillion of securities backed by subprime mortgages according to industry newsletter inside mortgage finance now the housing market slump is causing a spike in mortgage delinquencies and defaults which hurts the value of those bonds worried investors in turn are further driving down the bonds prices on wall street the bear stearns hedge funds problems point to another sensitive issue markets for exotic investments like derivatives linked to subprime mortgages have exploded in size in the past few years but it is often hard to attach an accurate value to those assets last month enhanced leverage reported that its value fell in april after the funds bets on the mortgage market went wrong two weeks later it put the loss at spooking already nervous investors and creditors and sending many of them running for the exits the huge revision at least in part reflected conversations bear stearns hedge fund managers had with bond dealers three of which told them in late april that some of the funds assets were worth less than the values stated on the funds books according to a person familiar with the matter so far the turmoil doesnt seem to be significantly hurting the broader bond markets but as the bear stearns funds unwind positions investors and traders could reassess the value of other debt securities as a result investors far beyond the reach of the funds could find their holdings of similar debt worth less than they thought the housing downturn has already claimed some high profile casualties among investors and traders in mortgage backed securities in may swiss investment bank ubs ag shut down its hedge fund dillon read capital management after bad trades in subprime mortgage loans led to a &# million loss unlike stocks and treasury bonds whose prices are continually quoted and easily obtained many of these derivative instruments trade infrequently and dont have clear market prices to come up with market values for these investments a process known as "marking" their positions to market investment funds often rely on their own valuation models they might also ask the dealers who sell them the bonds to update them on changes in the bonds underlying value when there are no sales to base prices on dealers come up with prices based on their own statistical models and an array of assumptions about whats happening in the market or the assets that back the securities "theres some real concern about how realistic dealer quotes are " said andrew lo a finance professor at the massachusetts institute of technology who is also a principal in alphasimplex group llc an asset management company that also runs a hedge fund "youre talking about quotes during normal times that are very different from quotes during stress times " there is no indication that bear stearnss fund managers sought to mislead lenders or investors about the value of the funds indeed the firms approach to valuing its securities seems to be in line with guidelines set up by moodys investors service which evaluates hedge fund practices but the crisis does point to the kinds of valuation problems hedge funds and their investors or lenders can run into even when they follow sound practices a forced sale of the bear stearns funds assets now could trigger a broader repricing of mortgage backed bonds and lead to losses and margin calls demands for additional cash or collateral at other funds that prospect might have given some of bear stearnss lenders which include merrill citigroup inc and barclays plc of britain an incentive to help out the funds but merrill and others decided to bail out of the funds yesterday the first two lenders to exit their positions goldman and bank of america agreed to unwind complicated transactions directly with bear stearns without dumping lots of bonds on the broader market merrill on the other hand moved toward seizing assets though its plans still could change it has indicated it intends to sell off at least &# million worth of collateral assets mostly mortgage related securities this afternoon according to documents reviewed by the wall street journal those plans come despite efforts by the bear stearns fund managers to stave off liquidation by lining up &# billion in new credit from parent company bear stearns and an additional &# million in new equity capital bear stearns and some of its executives had invested only &# million in the two hedge funds raising more than &# million of additional investments from outsiders including wealthy individuals and a breed of money managers known as "funds of funds " which spread their money around a collection of hedge funds in addition to the cash raised from investors bear stearnss enhanced leverage and credit strategies funds have invested billions of dollars borrowed from lenders as of march the enhanced leverage fund had &# million in investor capital and at least &# billion in borrowings it used the money to make &# billion in bullish bets and &# billion in bearish bets according to documents reviewed by the wall street journal its sister fund had &# million in investor money and made &# billion in bullish bets and &# billion in bearish bets a high level of "leverage " or use of borrowed money magnifies returns for a fund if everything works as planned if the security drops in value that same leverage can amplify losses consider the impact of an investment in a &# security with &# of a funds own money and &# of borrowed money annual interest of or &# on that security could be amplified to returns of for the fund however if the value of the security dropped by just to &# the loss would translate into a drop in the funds own money that in turn could trigger a margin call by the funds lenders prominent in the bear stearns funds portfolio were investments in collateralized debt obligations or cdos which are pools of securities that can include mortgage backed bonds corporate bonds or leveraged loans among other things many of the cdos the bear stearns funds invested in were pools of mortgage backed bonds wall street sells pieces of cdos to investors all over the world with some taking risky pieces that are more prone to losses but that promise high returns while other investors take safer lower yielding pieces they are complicated investments to value because they are effectively giant bundles of securities that have been put together and taken apart again and changes in the mortgage market for example can be glacial the default and recovery process in the housing market takes months to sort out meaning that the impact can take time before it is felt in a cdo annual issuance of cdos has soared to slightly more than &# billion last year from about &# billion in according to morgan stanley until recently the returns on these investments were high and investors felt protected by safeguards in the way they were structured in the first five months of this year alone about &# billion of cdos were issued morgan stanley says many of these investments have included securities based on subprime mortgages which have tumbled in value in recent months meanwhile the issuance of derivatives meant to mimic cdos which are known as synthetic products probably hit about &# trillion last year morgan stanley said the issue of pricing has plagued the hedge fund industry for several years in the securities and exchange commission accused four men involved in running beacon hill asset management llc of intentionally shading the value of their own investment in mortgage backed bonds to inflate the value of their portfolio when reporting returns to investors the men settled with the sec for &# million and were banned from the industry for hedge funds the incentives to abuse the murkiness of the market can be huge because they are compensated by fees based on the values of their portfolios "hedge funds have the incentive to mark their positions more favorably because their compensation is tied to those marks " says one senior federal reserve official "no one in the subprime business wants to ask the question of whether they need to re mark all the assets that would open the floodgates " said janet tavakoli president of tavakoli structured finance a consulting firm in chicago "everyone is trying to stop the problem but they should face up to it the assets may all be mispriced " the problems can be exacerbated because many hedge funds invest in cdos with the help of borrowed money to buy a triple a rated cdo note for &# it is common for a hedge fund to put down only &# of its own money and borrow the other &# from a bank to finance the purchase
