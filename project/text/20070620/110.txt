the many costs of bolivian tin huanuni bolivia "say hello to the devil " said a mine worker as he gestured to a colorful altar with a horned figure draped with coca leaves "if we keep uncle content hell protect us in the mine " the worker said through a golf ball sized wad of coca leaves in his cheek a few drops of homemade liquor were spilled as an offering at the feet of the sinister figure before the miner took a swig and passed it on to his co workers taking a break deep within the mine shaft the huanuni tin mine high in the bolivian altiplano is the site of deadly conflicts and harsh working conditions it is also seen as a test ground for the governments efforts to increase its control over the mining industry through higher taxes for international mining operations majority control of all new projects and direct management of the mine and the vinto smelter that refines the ore into tin ingots but huanuni has posed sharp challenges for president evo morales with worker strikes and battles with miners marring the project despite the benefits of sky high tin prices that have boosted government revenue last october up to people were killed and injured at the site when workers at the mine cooperative and government employees waged street battles throwing dynamite at each other following the clashes president morales stepped in and banned cooperative mining at the site offering the co op workers jobs with the state mining company comibol about accepted swelling the ranks of government workers to more than "things have calmed down there are no more cooperative workers at the site now " mine manager carlos bravo said in broken english he learned studying mine engineering at harvard years ago the move seemed to quell the violence although a supervisor at the mine had dynamite thrown at his house last week which only damaged the structure and left his family unharmed tin thieves were blamed for the attack high prices for tin have spurred illegal mining higher up on the mountain with thieves drilling their own shafts and stealing &# of tin a month according to the company all vehicles leaving huanuni are searched by mine workers supported by soldiers toting machine guns to ensure that no tin is smuggled out workers complain of poor ventilation at the far reaches of the mine almost two miles from the entrance lung diseases are common with miners often removing the masks theyre issued because saying the filters make it hard to breathe no food is allowed in the mine and workers instead chew coca to stem hunger through their eight hour shifts the government pledged to modernize the plant and mine following the takeover but workers gripe that the processing machinery is outdated a quick look at the facility gives their complaints credibility a series of tattered buildings roll down the hill from the mine mouth many marked with stenciled images of che guevara each lower level spits out a finer grind of stone until the final shack where the tin powder is chemically separated from impurities and sent for drying and bagging walkways are often wood planks and the machinery bears the marks of more than years of ceaseless operation despite the conflict and harsh conditions workers flock to the mine for the bolivianos or about &# a day that a starting worker makes a sum well more than common nationwide salaries the security offered by a regular paycheck is probably an even bigger draw in a country where more than live below the poverty line at the entrance to the mine site a sign reads "there isnt a single vacancy in any sector of the company please dont insist " yet despite the rough edges the mine continues to spill forth tin bags of the heavy metal are loaded on trucks that ramble down the dry valley past adobe huts and old women herding llamas and sheep the destination is the empresa metalurgica vinto tin smelter seized by the government in february from glencore international ag amid government accusations of an illegal transfer of the plant to the company and failure to comply with contractual updating requirements labor strife and repeated strikes have stunted production at the mine as well as at the vinto smelter that depends on huanuni for supplies workers shut down the smelter for three days in may and threaten similar measures this month in a dispute over bonuses however the vinto smelter has resumed exports after the nationalization froze sales in may the company sold tons of tin to glencore and cooper trading inc and plans to accept offers for a second lot this month sales director rush garcia said despite its domination of tin industry operations the government has said that it isnt considering expropriating other existing mines last year president morales issued a decree nationalizing the oil and gas industry but foreign oil companies were allowed to remain in the country after ceding a larger share of revenue and giving control of their bolivian operations to the state the government appears to be taking a similar tack with the mining sector bolivia intends to raise taxes on existing mines to from under a plan proposed last week by mr morales "we are not contemplating further nationalizations as long as the companies comply with all laws and do not hide information " mining minister luis alberto echazu said however those that fail to comply may be targeted for expropriation he cautioned in addition future projects will have to be undertaken in partnership with the state mining company he said local mine cooperatives which have fiercely resisted efforts to raise fees will be exempt from the increased taxes under the plan the government appears to be avoiding further confrontation with the co op mines after its successful takeover of huanuni as mr morales is well aware the miners have access to dynamite and arent afraid to use it
