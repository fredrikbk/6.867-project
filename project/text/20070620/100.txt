rebranding at&amp t cingulars demise and iphones rise questions for wendy clark title senior vice president for advertising company at&amp t inc apple isnt the only company with a lot at stake from this months heavily publicized launch of the iphone at&amp t the telecommunications giant that negotiated a deal to be the sole carrier of the phone is hoping the alliance will help re establish its name as a wireless brand earlier this year at&amp t renamed its cingular wireless service with the at&amp t brand a couple of years after cingular itself took over the at&amp t wireless name for months the san antonio company has run a heavy marketing campaign to remind consumers that at&amp t inc has taken over bellsouth and has full control of cingular wireless the latest step in that marketing effort was launched monday with a new television print and online campaign the new ad series keeps elements of cingular advertising including the color orange but does away with other elements such as cingulars x shaped "jack" logo in addition the company is removing the cingular name from signs at the companys wireless provider stores and from its voice recordings new customer handsets cellphone screen displays and billing statements at&amp t expects to completely phase out the cingular name by the end of this year at&amp ts senior vice president of advertising wendy clark says the company did extensive research with consumers and learned that they trusted the at&amp t name when it came to services such as telephone landlines television broadband and wireless "its an iconic brand " she says ms clark talks below about getting consumers to understand the new at&amp t and how to harness the buzz from apples iphone the wall street journal how exactly does this latest round of ads help the rebranding effort wendy clark what we want to do is be very clear that at&amp t is in the wireless business so we were very discreet with that message we havent hung a lot else off it and that was really deliberate we dont want anything to get in the way of that specific communication that at&amp t is in the wireless business wsj cingular wireless advertising had a particular look that appealed to young customers how do you keep those young users and how do you keep that cool factor that had been attached to that brand ms clark we have every intention of doing that the youth market is fairly brand fickle they just dont attach to brands the way we might have seen other audiences do in the past and literally in these focus groups you can hold up a great mp player or some cool gadget that they really like and say ok so set aside your thoughts on who the brand is say at&amp t brought you this mp player or brought you this great gaming system what would you think of the brand at&amp t and you know the response is well i would love it so that is very indicative of the youth audience today its about what you bring them and that will increase your relevance and their usage of your brand and by the way if you brought them something great yesterday that doesnt matter anymore it has to be this progressive and constant innovation thats very relevant that will earn your space for you in the youth market and were keenly aware of that wsj why keep the orange color in the campaign ms clark were going to wring every drop of equity out of cingular and part of that equity and part of their success was their deep association with orange we thought it was compelling as we started to play with it we liked how it worked in our communications we liked how the globe looked with orange wsj will the orange eventually go away ms clark nope there are no plans to get rid of the orange the orange is going to be very evocative of at&amp t from here on out wsj how do you market a product like the iphone thats already got so much buzz and is made by a partner company known for its own distinctive advertising style how do you get the at&amp t name out there when it comes to the iphone ms clark at&amp ts name is out there when it comes to the iphone weve had more than one million people go to our web site and sign up to be the first to learn more about the iphone launch as youve seen the new at&amp t name is prominently included in the current tv advertising all the news stories running daily directly connect the new at&amp t and the iphone and people will come to our at&amp t wireless stores to see and buy the iphone wsj part of the deal with apple means that at&amp t name wont be on the iphone how do you market a product that doesnt carry your company name ms clark specifically at&amp ts name is on the phone in the network identifier but more importantly the exclusivity of the relationship provides at&amp t a unique opportunity in the wireless marketplace to bring only our customers a next generation product that the market is clamoring for fulfilling a market need with a compelling product that only you can deliver is about as good as marketing gets wsj everyones tinkering with their ad offerings and experimenting with different forms of advertising from viral marketing to program integrations what do you think has the most potential ms clark i dont know if there is any one we are doing all of that weve got viral programs web based programs nontraditional outdoor print i think that we are all looking for the way to capture a very fragmented markets attention and quite honestly different things can work for different products for us measurement is going to be king where media is concerned the more measurable a medium can be for us the higher priority and more attention it gets from us around here
