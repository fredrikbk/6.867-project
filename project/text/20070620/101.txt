the afternoon report no dice online edition kirk kerkorian scrapped his offer to buy two of mgm mirages most treasured assets and as a result investors picked up the chips they had plunked down on the company in hopes of a deal and beat a path to the buffet last month mr kerkorians tracinda investment vehicle which holds of the casino giant signaled its interested in buying the glamorous bellagio hotel and casino and project citycenter a sprawling development in las vegas that includes private homes hotels a resort casino and tons of shopping expected to open in investors sensed that tracindas interest had opened the door for some deep pocketed private equity player to happen along and snap up mgm mirage in its entirety and the piling in ahead of a possible deal sent the companys stock on a furious rally in the past month or so but tracinda decided to step back after mgm agreed to a joint venture with kerzner international and stock markets figured that the news sapped the probability of a buyout j p morgan analyst harry c curtis wrote that todays developments imply "that an outright sale of mgm in the near term is now off the table " their dreams of a massive payday thwarted speculators left to hunt for a new gamble and mgm mirage shares tumbled as much as in early trading but as the morning wore on the shares perked up as many investors apparently came around to the idea that the days news was good even if visions of a buyout turned out to be well a mirage mr kerkorians decision was cast as a vote of confidence in the long term tracinda said that joint ventures such as the deal with kerzner show theres "significant potential to unlock value for the companys shareholders through a variety of strategic transactions involving the companys assets " analysts agreed mr curtis wrote that pursuing more joint ventures would allow the company to collect a bundle in management fees and that any cash mgm rakes in on that front could be pushed back to shareholders through stock buybacks lehman brothers analyst felicia r hendrix said that instant gratification had taken a backseat to long term value not an everyday sentiment in las vegas and told clients that the news
