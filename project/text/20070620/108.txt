collecting social security benefits many people who prepare their own tax returns make mistakes figuring how much of their social security benefits are taxable according to a recent report by the treasury inspector general for tax administration www tigta gov even tax experts agree the rules are surprisingly complicated "its taken me years to figure it out and im still not sure" of all the details says len burman a former treasury department official and now director of the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution the treasury report was designed to identify people who repeatedly received the same math error notices from the internal revenue service and whether the agency could "better address the issues" causing the notices for tax year the irs sent out notices to people saying they had miscalculated the taxable amounts of social security benefits the report says more than or got that notice a second time the report estimates more than taxpayers received it for a third time about million individual income tax returns reported taxable social security benefits for up nearly from the prior year according to irs estimates the treasury report also says the irs spotted numerous taxpayer errors in other areas for example taxpayers made errors calculating or reporting their self employment tax many got the tax right but carried the wrong amounts forward to form from a separate schedule others calculated the tax wrong separately many older taxpayers claimed the wrong amount for the standard deduction the report notes taxpayers who are or over are blind or both qualify for a higher standard deduction the report urges the irs to do a better job helping people calculate taxability of social security benefits and other issues for example the authors urge the irs to "modify" error notices in order to provide a "clearer and more informative explanation" of the mistakes people routinely make the report also recommends changes to various forms and instructions associated with those errors and urges the irs to continue studying ways to simplify tax preparation for older people the irs in its response to the report agreed with some of the recommendations and agreed to continue researching ways to simplify tax preparation for older taxpayers one way to reduce the chance of mistakes is to buy tax
