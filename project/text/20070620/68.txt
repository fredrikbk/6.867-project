long term rate rise prompts strategy shift as yield curve returns to normal investors start to ditch short term bonds while home buyers reconsider options the recent bond market rout is prompting some fixed income investors and mortgage shoppers to rethink their strategies some investors have begun buying bonds with longer maturity dates taking advantage of yields that moved higher as bond prices fell meanwhile as rates on year mortgages also jumped some borrowers have begun taking another look at adjustable rate mortgages bank of america corp for instance says its seeing increased interest in hybrid arms that carry a fixed rate for the first three five seven or years and then adjust annually the new consumer strategies reflect a significant shift in the yield curve or the difference between the yields on short term and long term bonds for the first time in about a year long term bonds are returning more than short term instruments that represents a more normal state of affairs because investors expect to reap greater rewards for locking up their money for a longer period of time mike bangs a houston retiree says he started buying longer term municipal bonds in the past two weeks as yields rose on the long end "until recently i wasnt getting good prices in the to year range " says the year old who has typically bought bonds with terms ranging from to years "recently its gotten" to where the longer dated issues are attractive of course rising rates are generally bad news for investors existing bond holdings because newer issues make the older lower yielding bonds less attractive indeed bond mutual funds which had seen record inflows through may saw two of the biggest single day outflows in the past two weeks in over two years according to trimtabs an independent research firm that tracks fund flows whats more some money managers expect long term interest rates will continue to move higher amid concerns over global inflation and other factors and some investors are keeping their powder dry "fair value yes but i think they can get cheaper before the green light to buy bonds is turned on " says dan shackelford portfolio manager of t rowe price group inc s new income fund and inflation protected bond fund the yield on year treasury notes a benchmark that influences many long term interest rates including home mortgages was at yesterday after hitting a recent end of day peak of last week thats nearly half a percentage point above three month treasury bills which yielded at yesterdays close about a month ago the roles were reversed with the yield on the three month bill topping that of the year note the steepening of the yield curve creates new planning opportunities for income oriented investors who have gravitated to cash and other short term investments in recent years retail investors are likely to start slowly in coming weeks by rolling over their short term cds into intermediate term bonds with three to five year maturities or longer says tom ricketts president and chief executive of incapital llc a chicago investment bank that specializes in underwriting bonds for retail investors municipal bonds are looking increasingly attractive marilyn cohen president of envision capital management inc a los angeles investment firm has been buying more intermediate term municipal bonds with four to eight year maturities now paying more than previously investors would have had to buy bonds that mature in to years to get the same level of yields she says one investing strategy that is expected to get a boost is "laddering " where investors buy bonds scheduled to come due at several different dates in the future rather than all in the same year the idea is that if interest rates rise investors may be able to take advantage of higher rates by buying new bonds with money coming from maturing issues and even if rates fall investors will have some protection because their overall portfolio return is going to be higher than the market rates "it makes sense that bond investors are finally starting to play the curve finally something is happening " says james bianco president of bianco research llc a market research firm in chicago the rise in long term rates is unwelcome news for most borrowers looking to refinance a mortgage or buy a home the rate on year fixed rate loans climbed to last week according to hsh associates though still low by historical standards thats well above the recent low of in december and the highest rate in nearly a year mortgage rates fell slightly yesterday to an average of according to hsh fixed rate loans remain the mortgage of choice for many borrowers in the current environment dan arrigoni president of u s bank home mortgage a unit of u s bancorp says more than of the banks borrowers are opting for a fixed rate loan nationwide arms accounted for just of loan applications in may down from nearly last year according to the mortgage bankers association but as rates move higher some borrowers are taking another look at adjustables peter foley an insurance underwriter was considering both a fixed rate loan and an arm to finance his purchase of a square foot home in canton conn but after rates moved higher mr foley opted for a &# arm that carries a rate for the first four years "as we got closer to closing time the fixed rate option has pretty much come off the table " says mr foley who believes the arms four year fixed rate period provides sufficient protection against future rate increases michael menatian the mortgage banker who arranged for the loan says he has seen a jump in the number of borrowers taking such loans the benefits of taking out a hybrid arm have increased recently although the spread between rates on hybrids and fixed rate loans is small by historical standards borrowers can cut the rate on their loan by about percentage point by opting for a hybrid arm thats fixed for five years instead of a year fixed rate mortgage that spread is the widest since october but well below the percentage point average over the past years according to hsh associates for now hybrid arms are likely to get more attention from borrowers with larger loan balances "the jumbo category loans above &# is where youre probably going to see the most movement " says brad blackwell a national sales manager for wells fargo &amp co in part because borrowers with larger loan amounts tend to be more sophisticated the potential savings from switching to an arm can be greater too for borrowers with larger loans as mortgage rates moved upward many borrowers rushed to lock in a loan ahead of future increases "when interest rates go up traditionally the fence sitters kind of scamper to do something " says mr arrigoni he says u s banks loan volume climbed the day after year treasury rates jumped for borrowers facing a rate increase on their adjustable rate mortgage "theres still some benefit to refinancing " says keith gumbinger a mortgage analyst with hsh associates "but its not nearly the compelling sort of move it was a few weeks ago " some borrowers considering a cash out refinancing might decide to postpone that move because of higher rates although theres no assurance that rates will fall substantially says greg mcbride a senior financial analyst with bankrate com on a &# loan the recent half percentage point increase in rates will cost borrowers about &# a month he says mitch ohlbaum a mortgage broker in los angeles says hes counseling clients looking to refinance to wait until rates fall or if they need to pull out cash to take out a fixed rate home equity loan particularly if they have a low rate on their current mortgage rates on fixed rate home equity loans currently average according to hsh the rate game with long term rates now higher than short term rates investors and home buyers should consider new strategies fixed income investors may want to consider buying longer term bonds and cds building ladders of investments that come due at different dates can hedge against interest rate risk some borrowers are taking another look at hybrid arms mortgages that carry a fixed rate for several years
