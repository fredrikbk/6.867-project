tv station sales are clicking new york local television has been the darling of the media sector and an increasing number of companies are hoping to cash in on what could be the peak of the market nexstar broadcasting group inc and lin tv corp announced last month they are considering potential sales of their companies last week news corp said it plans to sell nine tv stations affiliated with its fox network and insurer lincoln national corp is considering options for its media assets which include three tv stations some believe the sudden flood of nearly tv stations on the auction block could dampen what have been sizzling sales prices in recent deals most industry participants however believe sellers will continue to reap windfalls as they rush to take advantage of favorable sentiment for the local television industry and sunny financing markets for buyers if recent rich sales multiples continue more sellers could jump in as cash fueled private equity firms prove to be hungry acquirers during the recent local tv binge deal making already has been heavy this year for local tv stations that air programming from cbs abc and other broadcast networks in recent months private equity firms have spent roughly &# billion collectively to scoop up the tv portfolios of new york times co and clear channel communications inc as well as seven stations deemed non strategic to cbs corp in recent deals the private investors have paid an estimated to times the stations cash flow a few years ago investor sentiment had soured on tv stations and sales were fetching only times cash flow stations were slow to sell if they sold at all bankers asset brokers and analysts say the recent rich valuations can hold up even with so many tv assets up for sale at once "multiples are not seeing pressure at this point " said david bank an analyst at rbc capital "there are only so many assets the market can digest that said there is such a deep pocket of private equity money out there " buyers may not be able to keep a lid on prices as stocks of most public tv broadcasters have climbed on takeover hopes even before the sales announcement nexstar shares had more than doubled since the end of last year and lin had soared the recent flurry of deals follows several years of doldrums for local tv investors fretted that cable television and the internet were stealing viewers and that stations would have to spend mightily to meet regulatory requirements for digital broadcasts the dour climate affected both stock prices of public companies and the market for asset sales worries about the industry havent been erased but the sectors upsides are gaining renewed attention millions of people still tune into their local tv stations each night to watch "american idol" or "csi " profits from local news operations make stations less dependent than ever on network programming there are also hopes for robust ad revenue from the election year political races wall street is optimistic about a new revenue stream as cable satellite and other pay tv companies begin paying to carry local tv channels the recent turn in sentiment is a relief for station owners and many have been looking to pounce on the renewed optimism "there are a pent up amount of sellers that are now looking to take advantage of the favorable market " said robin flynn associate director with research firm snl kagan public market valuations are also on the upswing but the sentiment turn is showing up most starkly in the asset sales there were &# billion in tv assets sold last year after a two year trough when there were &# billion worth of deals in and &# billion in according to snl kagan perhaps more than any other factor its the appetite of private equity firms flush with cash and willing to lard up companies with debt that has driven the favorable markets for local tv for the growing pools of private capital local tv is a mouth watering target the businesses generate huge amounts of cash and operating margins for network affiliated tv stations can be as high as even for companies that werent expected to be sellers the money thrown around by private equity can be too rich to resist nexstar which had been hoping to acquire more stations to add to its station group instead found itself among losing bidders for clear channels television stations providence equity partners won a well attended auction in april with a &# billion bid or an estimated to times multiple the lost prey and the hefty price tag spurred nexstar to consider a sale the company has said private equity firms also are considered likely acquirers of the latest assets wachovia analyst marci ryvicker said lin tv and nexstar could be snatched up by a single private equity firm publicly traded television groups could look to pick up a station or two but it will be hard to justify rich deals to wall street unless the acquired stations provide strategic benefits such as giving an operator two stations in one city more public operators of local tv stations could also look to add themselves to the sales pool family run young broadcasting inc which operates television stations has been cited as one potential company next on the auction block young broadcasting declined to comment a potential downturn in financing markets could dampen enthusiasm from private equity though its unlikely banks will turn off the debt spigot to television deals "every six months we say to ourselves weve never seen a debt market like this " said brian pryor vice president at media venture partners an investment bank focused on the broadcasting industry mr pryor expects deal making to continue and said local tv remains a sellers market "frankly there is all the demand we can hope for to suck up that supply "
