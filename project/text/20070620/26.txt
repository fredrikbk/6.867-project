common sense with yield curve back to normal cds still shine smartmoney guess what the yield curve is "normal" again youd think that would get investors excited after all when the yield curve inverted more than two years ago there was plenty of hand wringing about the likelihood of an imminent recession but after last weeks sharp rise in long term interest rates pushed year u s treasury rates to and short term rates remained more than basis points lower the yield curve now slopes upward at all maturity levels a basis point is one one hundredth of a percentage point this kind of "normal" yield curve is usually just what investors want its traditionally a harbinger of steady if unspectacular growth bond investors get paid more for lending their money for longer periods which only seems fair the stock market responded by resuming the rally that had been derailed initially by the steep increase in rates the problem is that the conventional wisdom about yield curves and the economy has been stood on its head in recent years and no one has yet offered a convincing explanation why the inverted yield curve didnt result in a recession or anything close to it on the contrary global economic growth has been so strong that the biggest worry in the credit markets remains inflation indeed it was inflation fears that sparked last weeks interest rate spike as best as anyone can tell no less an authority than former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan called the recent inverted yield curve a "conundrum " thats because the feds campaign to raise short term rates led to lower rather than higher long term rates do we now have the makings of a new conundrum higher long term rates that remain so in the face of slower growth or even fed cuts time will tell but after the past few years nothing would surprise me i dont think investors should underestimate the significance of a sustained rise in long term rates to an economy that has become gorged on easy credit financial institutions are likely to bear the brunt especially those that have cashed in on the mergers and acquisitions and private equity booms both heavily dependent on low rates and easy borrowing conditions thats one reason i sold covered calls recently against my position in goldman sachs which last week reported some modest tremors from the subprime lending meltdown as did bear stearns sooner or later higher borrowing costs are also going to affect consumers how theyre going to keep paying their gasoline and heating bills while adapting to a wave of adjustable rate mortgage increases remains to be seen but im wary of consumer sectors especially retail for fixed income investors its still an easy call two to five year certificates of deposit as readers of this column know ive been positioned for higher long term rates for years advocating a ladder of two to three year maturities the recent increase in rates has had almost no impact on their value given their short duration and relatively high yields i have a cd maturing this week and i plan to roll it over into another three year cd the good news is that cd rates keep creeping higher when i recently checked six month cds were yielding to nearly for five year cds not bad for low risk federally insured deposits especially when other asset classes look overvalued james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
