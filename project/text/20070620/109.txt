the blackstone tax so lets compare country a takes a &# billion stake like any other investor in a companys initial public offering country b doesnt bother with such capitalist niceties and instead arbitrarily changes its tax law to grab a share of the ipos income stream who would have guessed that country a is communist china and country b is america yet thats exactly whats happening in the case of the blackstone group the big private equity firm that is floating a &# billion ipo as early as this week the chinese are behaving like good capitalist investors while the u s congress is playing the role of confiscatory commissars congressional staffers dont even bother to hide the tax bills arbitrary nature calling it "the blackstone bill" and preparing to pass it without hearings treasury analysis or debate in tax writing committees asked why he is undertaking this exercise montanas democratic senator max baucus candidly explained "because its in the news so much theres an awful lot of money there " maybe blackstone should have floated its ipo in beijing or at least london what has mr baucus and his gop running mate chuck grassley in a lather is that under its proposed "corporate partnership" structure blackstone would pay a tax rate on profits rather than the corporate income tax the basis for this unusual tax treatment dates to a law that exempted partnerships from corporate tax if they derive of their revenues from "passive type income " the senators charge that blackstone is exploiting a tax loophole that "could fundamentally erode the corporate tax base " so they want to hit the company and other private equity firms that go public with the corporate rate the senators do ask a fair question why should private equity partnerships have the advantages of corporate designation most importantly the access to capital markets without having to pay corporate income tax one answer is that the companies owned by these equity funds do pay corporate income tax when they earn income the payments these companies make to the equity partnership are dividend payments and thus should be taxed as such there is a sound rationale for the passive income exclusion it ensures that corporate income tax isnt collected twice on the same income stream under the baucus grassley proposal blackstones investment income would be taxed first at a corporate tax rate on say american widget company when it earned the profits taxed again when those profits are passed on to blackstone at another corporate income tax rate and then taxed a third time at a capital gains tax when blackstone distributes its earnings to partners and shareholders surely senators baucus and grassley dont favor triple taxation by the way some income earned by the corporate partnership such as management fees that blackstone charges its investors for the service of operating the asset portfolios would be subject to the corporate rate so would income earned from companies owned by the fund that do not pay corporate income tax themselves in these cases the income is passed through what is called a "blocker entity" and every penny of the earnings are subject to corporate tax by the partnership so despite protests to the contrary the corporate tax base has not sprung some gigantic new leak well grant however that this blackstone fracas does highlight the mess that is the u s corporate tax code the u s corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the world but the truth is that many if not most companies pay a lower "effective" tax rate some of the largest u s companies shelter as much income overseas as possible to pay lower foreign rates the u s treasury never sees a dime of that money other companies exploit various domestic tax wrinkles "credits" and deductions which are perfectly legal and many of which have sound economic justifications all of them were passed by congress to assuage some corporate lobby or another if congress really wanted to stop this corporate tax "leakage " itd reduce the corporate rate for all companies to or so ireland and other countries have done this to their great economic and fiscal benefit the tax arbitragers would be quickly unemployed and these tax fights with millions of dollars spent on lobbyists and legal expenses would cease the evidence around the world is that a low flat tax rate increases compliance and might yield considerably more income than todays rate with its swiss cheese of exceptions theres another irony here advocates of higher taxes on the rich argue that congress has a duty to inform blackstones prospective shareholders about the potential tax hike before the ipo thats because if taxes are raised on these partnerships the value of their shares will fall and no one wants small investors to take a hit but the same logic should also apply to the tax rate on dividends and capital gains that senator baucus and his fellow democrats want to increase to and by letting the bush tax cuts expire that would also whack small investors by slashing stock values blackstone ceo stephen schwarzman is far from the worlds most sympathetic capitalist his garish th birthday party this year played into the hands of populists looking for a real life gordon gekko to skewer moreover longtime blackstone senior partner pete peterson who stands to become an instant billionaire with the ipo has himself spent decades lobbying for higher taxes but america didnt become prosperous by punishing men because of their lifestyle or previous policy errors thats the sort of thing they do or used to do in beijing see related letter "letters to the editor penalizing the successful could boomerang again" wsj june
