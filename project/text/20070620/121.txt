when retirement experts talk why doesnt anybody listen experts offer all kinds of rock solid retirement advice mostly its ignored over the past decade academics and investment advisers have done a heap of research into retirement issues including how much to save when to claim social security and how best to draw down a portfolio but most folks just arent paying attention and the rest dont seem to like the advice making plans according to experts we should settle on a retirement date save diligently so we retire with or of our preretirement income and cut back on stocks as we age the reality however is a whole lot messier studies have found that older investors dont cut back their stock exposure that only a minority of households bother calculating how much they need to save for a comfortable retirement and that many seniors quit the work force before their target retirement date perhaps as much as three years earlier even more alarming just of workers report that they or their spouse have any retirement savings at all according to a recent study by the employee benefit research institute and mathew greenwald &amp associates the result fidelity investments fidelity research institute calculates that the typical household is on track to retire with only of its preretirement income this figure includes social security and pension income to make matters worse if things go awry you may not even get to that warns guy patton the institutes executive director "people may be derailed by health issues or layoffs " he says indeed retiring earlier than expected can create a slew of financial pressures "now youve got a longer retirement you have a larger reduction in your social security benefit and you tap your k earlier " notes alicia munnell director of boston colleges center for retirement research "it sets you back on every front " collecting checks retirees are often counseled to lock up a healthy stream of guaranteed lifetime income by purchasing immediate annuities and by delaying social security to get a larger benefit but in reality more than half of seniors choose to take social security at age the earliest possible age meanwhile according to insurance researchers limra international last years immediate fixed annuity sales amounted to &# billion a pittance compared with the &# billion that poured into mutual funds "people value the bird in the hand and that stream of income in the future just doesnt seem that significant " prof munnell says "theres a huge preference for piles over flows " drawing down after years of debate theres an emerging consensus among financial advisers that retirees ought to use a or portfolio withdrawal rate this is the percentage of a nest eggs value withdrawn in the first year of retirement in subsequent years retirees are assumed to step up the dollar amount withdrawn at the inflation rate with this approach you can be reasonably confident that your money will last through a year retirement even if you find yourself drawing down your portfolios principal sound like a sensible strategy its also widely ignored instead most seniors seem to follow the old rule that says you can spend your income but you should never touch your capital except maybe for hefty expenses like big medical bills and costly home repairs "people arent interested in spending down their assets " says vanguard group economist john ameriks "theyre interested in spending from their portfolios they spend their dividends and interest they dont regularly spend down their principal " is there anything wrong with any of this you will likely have a more comfortable retirement if you delay social security buy income annuities and follow a well considered portfolio withdrawal strategy but in the end its probably safe to ignore the experts provided you dont ignore their most important recommendation which is to save diligently during your working years rough road ahead americans have high hopes for their retirement but little saved about are very or somewhat confident they will have enough to retire comfortably almost half of those saving for retirement have less than &# salted away source ebri and mathew greenwald
