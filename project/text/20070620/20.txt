capt burke died on at the hands of enemy combatants in response to your june editorial "al qaedas american harbor" it is reassuring to know that under the ruling by the fourth circuit court if a mohammid atta were apprehended today before he could murder several thousand people he would be properly freed and im sure the authorities who seized him appropriately castigated thankfully the fourth circuit is there to protect our civil liberties and protect our right to die at the hands of terrorists who are not "enemy combatants " interestingly the silence from those who for years have lambasted the bush administration over is deafening it makes one wonder if the demand for accountability was to ensure national security or to put a head on a plate the morning of sept my brother fdny capt billy burke of engine co called from his firehouse to his family and friends in new york before the second plane hit to warn them "we are under terrorist attack " to refer to them as "terrorists" was highly politically incorrect in regard to those who flew the planes that "hit" the towers the poor "wretched" and "have nots " as bill clintons assistant secretary of state called them at yale a few days after regrettably he did not have time to consider their "combatant" status well at least he didnt call them "enemy combatants " that sort of designation would be in violation of the spirit of the &# million eight acre "memorial" at the wtc site that wont mention the attacks or "terrorists" so that it will avoid "telling us what to think " an hour later when on the th floor of wtc and aware of the collapse of wtc my brother ordered the successful evacuation of his men and that of engine and the civilians they helped save capt billy burke perished with ed beya a quadriplegic and abe zelmanowitz his friend who would not leave eds side he had an idea of what duty demanded of him not nuance not ambivalence not legal technicalities just like abe zelmanowitz he would follow it or not i suppose my brother would not have made a very good judge or "memorialist " however like his new york fire department brothers and two sisters and the millions who throughout history have given their lives for justice before him it is people like him whom civilization counts on michael burke bronx n y the wall street journal would like to wager that the decision of the fourth circuit in the al marri case will be overturned and that the "administrations legal antiterror architecture will survive past january " you ask "any takers " the survival of legal antiterror architecture strikes me as a bit vague for a wager but im a taker on the survival of the fourth circuit decision what stakes do you have in mind the fourth circuit decision rejecting "enemy combatant" status for a civilian with alleged ties to al qaeda is well reasoned and entirely consistent with the teachings of the supreme court the essential difficulty with the position of the administration and the journal is that your concept of enemy combatant is unmoored to any recognized precedent or principle under the laws of war it is a recipe for authoritarian rule with few if any discernible boundaries equally disturbing is your familiar disdain for our system of criminal justice that system though far from perfect is one of the cornerstones of the liberty of which we are justly proud we denigrate it at our peril douglas m parker south orleans mass the writer held senior positions as a lawyer in the nixon and ford administrations see related letter "letters to the editor ground zero memorial will discuss terrorism" wsj june
