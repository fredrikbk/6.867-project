legal fight delays new york calorie rule associated press new york fast food restaurants in new york are getting a temporary reprieve from a first in the nation rule requiring them to put calorie information on their menus the new regulation covering about city eateries was on track to take effect july until it was challenged in court last week by the new york state restaurant association the restaurants complained that the menu boards that hang above their counters would become a cluttered mess if they have to include a calorie count for every item the regulation requires calories to be listed as prominently as the price lawyers for the city said yesterday that they would delay enforcement until oct to give both sides more time to prepare for the legal fight after that restaurants that fail to comply could fail a health inspection and be subject to fines the practical effect of the change in the enforcement date will be small the city always had planned a three month grace period before it began assessing fines mcdonalds corp had said it wouldnt be able to comply with the ruling by july health department officials said that despite the delay in enforcement the law still will be on the books come july and they hoped restaurants would voluntarily comply the restaurants argue the new york city board of health exceeded its authority and singled out fast food when it crafted the rule last year the new rules apply only mainly to the big fast food chains not the thousands of delicatessens and pizza shops that pack the city restaurants could avoid the rule by yanking nutritional information altogether from public view
