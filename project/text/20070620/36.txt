tales of local heroes triumphing over chechen separatists american crime bosses and underworld hit men but their new gritty thriller "gruz " cargo takes aim at the ussrs twilight years triggering controversy with an unremittingly bleak and violent portrayal of the period as andrew osborn reports the film is named after the zinc lined coffins in which dead soviet soldiers were shipped home from the war in afghanistan director alexei balabanov and producer sergei selyanov say they made the movie as an antidote to rising nostalgia for the soviet period and the resurgence of soviet era symbols and thinking that resurgence is causing unease among russias cultural elite in the past year tv networks have aired major miniseries depicting the horrors of the soviet gulag based on works by alexander solzhenitsyn and other dissidents but "gruz " is far harsher than those works and is set in an era thats more recent read andrew osborns report http online wsj com article sb html foreign affair back in u s securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox endorsed a plan for a single global accounting standard that would let companies all over the world speak the same financial language the sec took a crucial step toward that goal wednesday unanimously voting to advance a proposal that would allow non u s companies to use international accounting standards for reporting financials in the u s regulators hope the move will spur more foreign companies to list shares in the u s accounting experts believe it may also mark the death knell for u s generally accepted accounting principles known as gaap as kara scannell and david reilly report non u s companies that list shares for trading in the u s currently must convert their financial results to conform to gaap thus keeping two sets of books ending the reconciliation requirement is expected to make it much less costly for foreign companies to list shares in the u s though regulators may require non u s firms to file quarterly reports instead of the currently mandated semiannual reports the ability to abandon u s accounting rules will likely save companies millions of dollars a year theres widespread concern about ensuring against extreme variations in accounting from company to company or country to country the sec acknowledges that the proposal raises the question of how to best ensure that u s investors are receiving accurate and consistent information but among many companies investors and analysts such convergence is a good thing the next key step toward a global accounting standard would be to allow u s firms to use international standards which the agency will consider this summer that move too would raise many questions and concerns for ensuring the accuracy of financial statements while gaap is thought of as a rules based approach the international financial reporting standards or ifrs is considered to be more reliant on the proper principles to follow and thus gives firms more leeway in their accounting the sec will seek public reaction on ending the reconciliation requirement for days after which a second vote by the five member commission is required before the rule takes effect read kara scannell and david reillys report on the secs announcement http online wsj com article sb html targeting india while toyota officials worry over how
