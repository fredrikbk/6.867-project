business bookshelf the harpooners harvest leviathan by eric jay dolin w w norton pages &# in the th century whaling became americas first major industry and in the mid th one of its largest today except for some alaska natives who hunt by traditional means it has vanished but the whaling business left behind a singularly rich history one abrim with adventure danger and profit of men who went down to the sea in ships to hunt the mightiest creatures who ever lived that story is told and told very well indeed by eric jay dolins "leviathan the history of whaling in america " before the industrial age and in fact well into it whales were cornucopias of useful products as mr dolin recounts even whale excrement was coveted for the red dye that could be extracted from it but the most important products derived from the giant mammals were whale oil indispensable as both an illuminant and lubricant and baleen the long flexible plates of keratinous material that form a comb hanging from the upper jaws of most whales and are used for filter feeding on small organisms such as krill and plankton before the advent of plastics baleen was employed in corsets buggy whips and countless other products that required strong light and flexible material the sperm whale the largest of the toothed whales might have lacked the baleen sought by whalers but it had other attractions capable of growing to more than feet and weighing up to tons the sperm whale afforded not only a bounty of regular whale oil but also a substance called spermaceti which candlemakers discovered made the best candles occasionally sperm whales were also the source of ambergris a somewhat mysterious and even today extremely valuable substance that serves as a fixative for perfumes an amazingly full account of the whales anatomy and its th century commercial uses alongside the familiar tale of a maimed captains monomania may be found in herman melvilles "moby dick " "drift whaling" harvesting whales that wash up from the depths and "shore whaling" hunting whales along the coast from open boats are practices that date to ancient times but as shipbuilding improved in the age of discovery pursuing whales on the open seas became feasible it was not long after the english began settling in the new world that american whaling began captain john smith in addition to helping found jamestown in tried his hand at whaling seven years later off the coast of the region he named new england but he had no luck and settled for cod as the population in new england increased the ocean inevitably beckoned as a source of food and income thin rocky soil made farming difficult so many new englanders turned to the sea for their livelihoods building ships from plentiful forests along the coast catching cod by the ton engaging in all manner of trade and hunting whales in ever growing numbers whaling could be a remunerative endeavor a single whale brought to shore could provide each of the whaleboats crew profits equal to half a years wages for a landlocked workman shore whaling soon depleted stocks within reach of open boats and many whale species especially the prized sperm whale did not come near shore by the mid th century whales were being hunted from ocean going ships ships that were equipped with brick lined furnaces and huge iron pots for rendering whale blubber for oil at sea obviating the need to return to port with the catch onboard rendering was a crucial development mr dolin tells us when american whalers realized that they could reach around the world they quickly began doing exactly that the revolution and the war of devastated american whaling the british attacked american whale ships and cut off exporters from foreign markets every whaling port in the u s shut down except for nantucket island the industrys capital "even this steadfast whaling community could only muster a handful of voyages " mr dolin writes "and each departure was attended by the fear that the vessels and their crews would never be seen again " but with the return of extended peace american whaling quickly rebounded and came to dominate the industry in of the whaling ships in operation around the world of them had sailed from the u s that was one fifth of the countrys merchant tonnage whaling employed people and in its best year hauled in whales that produced barrels of sperm oil barrels of whale oil and million pounds of baleen whaling was big business it was also as mr dolin makes vividly clear a dirty and dangerous one whaleboats sent out from the mother ship when a whale was spied were built for speed not strength and a single flick of a whales flukes could reduce one to kindling with ships awash in oil and their furnaces roaring onboard fire was a constant danger it was not uncommon for a whaling ship simply to vanish without a trace sunk by fire storm or a vengeful sperm whale "the only type of whale known to have sunk ships deliberately " mr dolin tells us "moby dick had to be a sperm whale" boredom was another problem as voyages grew longer and longer some ships remained at sea for two years or more and weeks could pass between whale sightings at least the boredom had one benefit the production of many fine specimens of scrimshaw carved from whale teeth bones and baleen american whalers ranged farther and farther across the worlds oceans as their prey grew scarce in home waters it was an american whaler who discovered the bounty mutineers on pitcairn island but as the price of whale oil ratcheted up in the face of increasing demand and decreasing supply competition from other sources began to increase when edwin drake demonstrated the practicality of drilling for petroleum in the glory days of american whaling were over mr dolin handles this long complex tale with great skill both as a historian and as a writer the bibliography and illustrations are splendid too thanks to his firm command of the tales narrative drive "leviathan" is thoroughly engaging even as american whaling is becalmed in the th century a ghost of a once great american industry perhaps the most romantic in the countrys business history mr gordon is the author of "empire of wealth the epic history of american economic power" he blogs regularly at americanheritage com
