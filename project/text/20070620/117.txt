small roasters are thought to be picking up some of the slack industry members say beans roasted nationally as tracked by coffee publications inc which doesnt reveal the companies it surveys are down slightly from last year in the latest figures million bags had been roasted from the start of to april compared with million in the same span those numbers are believed however to cover only about of

stores and food clubs with folgers share greater than kraft segafredo zanetti groups massimo zanetti beverage usa owner of chock full onuts hills brothers mjb and chase &amp sanborn is another leader big roasters offer traditional brands along with newer specialty type products lars atorf spokesman for procter &amp gamble said the decline in u s roastings into mid april reflects a slight market contraction for those companies surveyed he said the dip may be related to "sustained green coffee price increases in july december and resulting list price increases that we and competition had to take in october and january " folgers raised ground prices by cents a can or about in early january and raised prices for its gourmet line by maxwell house and chock full o nuts quickly followed with similar increases to explain lower national roastings mr atorf said "relatively high shelf prices of coffee might have played a role " meaning customers may have reduced purchases "but it would be speculation right now to view this as an ongoing trend or something that will continue through the year " he said "we have to closely observe the figures and should have a better understanding of them within the next to months " last year was a banner one for u s roasters hurrying to meet strong demand moreover the new orleans hub home to over roasters had just rebounded from hurricane katrina which struck in august folgers new orleans plant the worlds biggest roasting facility was shut after the storm but was fully operational again in november mr atorf noted ted lingle executive director

the company also operates a large roasting plant in fort worth texas don schoenholt president of gillies coffee co in new york americas oldest roasting firm said that changing consumer tastes have allowed specialty coffee roasters to flourish he said their roastings are undercounted in the coffee publication inc figures the cost of starting a roasting business which begins with expensive machinery has always been very high but the endeavor has become profitable he said attracting new entrepreneurs two decades ago the u s industry consolidated as giant coffee companies gobbled up smaller ones and while buyouts continue hundreds of small roasters who opened this decade have seen good returns on their investments thats because americans are willing to pay up for their favorite cup of joe now in the s it was unheard of to spend more than &# a cup except at an expensive restaurant but todays consumers dont mind shelling out &# to &# for their designer pick me ups mr schoenholt said he was staggered by the may turnout of over attendees at the specialty coffee association conference in california which attracted a number of new entrepreneurs fledgling coffee roasters have been helped by workshops on every aspect of the craft run by the specialty coffee association and the national coffee association he noted in the past years starbucks corp swelled from a regional roaster to the specialty coffee leader while caribou coffee co in minneapolis jumped to the no specialty chain peets coffee &amp tea inc in california and green mountain coffee roasters inc

arabicas the milder variety cultivated in brazil and central america have eased from a year high of &# a pound touched late last year and were recently hovering near &# a pound on the new york board of trade but mr atorf said "continuously strong robusta prices have not caused any unusual blend changes for folgers recent developments in green coffee prices havent caused a shift" at p&amp g folgers isnt allowed to say how much robusta coffee it uses mr schoenholt said if robusta prices continue to rise roasters who normally use them in blends might begin to upgrade to lower end arabicas robustas are still cheaper than arabicas robustas now account for a fourth of the beans consumed in the u s up from about in according to the international trade center a u n agency u s roasters stepped up robusta purchases in the s as vietnams exports of the hardier variety swelled making them inexpensive u s robusta usage however lags many other countries where espresso or instant coffee
