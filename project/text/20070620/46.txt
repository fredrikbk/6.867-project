group warns of free trade backlash globalization may be hurting low skilled workers in the u s and europe enough that politicians in both places may find it increasingly hard to sell voters on the benefits of free trade and open markets says one of the worlds leading economic institutes the organization for economic cooperation and development a paris based institute backed by the governments of leading industrialized countries is a staunch believer in free trade which most economists believe makes all countries richer overall including those with high wages but in its annual labor study the oecd acknowledges growing popular unease about globalization the growing integration of the world economy through trade and cross border investment and frets about a popular backlash if governments fail to ensure that lesser skilled workers share the benefits "millions are benefiting from globalization but at the same time theres a feeling somethings wrong with the process " says oecd secretary general jose angel gurria that is creating political resistance to further moves to free up international trade and investment he says particularly in the u s and france a growing number of economists are expressing concern about the number of losers from globalization despite strong economic growth these economists note many workers in developed countries are struggling to find well paid work amid a combination of cheap imports the relocation of factories and offices to low wage countries and changing technology "the conventional wisdom was that all boats would be lifted by the rising tide that was overly optimistic " says david audretsch director of the max planck institute for economics in germany so far most economists still think rising global competition is a fact of life established economies should adapt to rather than try to block the oecd praises countries such as denmark that have combined flexible labor markets with effective government help for workers who lose their jobs still the oecd argues that globalization is more benign than its public image widespread popular fears about losing jobs to low wage competitors in emerging economies such as china are exaggerated it says it estimates that the scale of offshoring or the shift of business functions overseas is modest so far in service industries although it is more widespread in manufacturing the oecd points out that many developed countries have cut unemployment in recent years the problem says mr gurria is partly about perceptions "without job losses people are fearing job losses " the think tanks report however suggests there are good grounds for some popular fears after much number crunching the employment outlook concludes that "the expansion of trade is a potentially important source of vulnerability for workers " globalization has probably contributed to slow wage growth in the u s and europe in recent years the report finds and is also partly to blame for rising income inequality since the mid s the incomes of the highest paid have grown at a faster rate than those of the lowest paid in out of countries surveyed oecd figures show but trade isnt the main culprit the oecd claims the spread of computer technology even harder to reverse than imports from china is the chief cause of the widening gap between the incomes of low skilled and high skilled workers it argues
