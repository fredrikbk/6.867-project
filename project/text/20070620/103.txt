the daily fix remembering terry hoeppner a coach worth celebrating online edition indiana university football coach terry hoeppner died tuesday morning of cancer at age hours later his family took part in a groundbreaking ceremony for a major upgrade of ius athletic facilities "there were cheerleaders and balloons on the day terry hoeppner passed and somehow it didnt seem inappropriate " bob kravitz writes in the indianapolis star "there were hors doeuvres and musical ensembles ceremonial shovels and glad tidings hardly the trappings one might expect on this most somber day but they didnt seem out of place go ahead with the groundbreaking ceremony jane hoeppner terrys wife told iu athletic director rick greenspan tuesday morning after her husband finally lost an unfair fight with cancer i want this to be a celebration and so it was a tempered celebration a celebration tinged with unspeakable sorrow but a celebration nonetheless " mr kravitz pays tribute to a coach whose life is worth celebrating "he saw his world through a cream and crimson prism the rest of us saw a shambles of a football program he saw a sleeping giant the rest of us saw antiquated facilities where football players stepped over each other to find room to study he saw the kinds of jaw dropping artists renderings we saw during tuesdays ceremony " fittingly he leaves a strong football legacy at a school where basketball has always been king "hoeppner went in two seasons at indiana and rarely does a record mislead as much as that one " ivan maisel writes on espn com "the hoosiers defeated no iowa last season indianas first victory over a top team in years and came within a close final game loss to purdue of qualifying for a bowl game one of the many legacies hoeppner leaves is the pairing of quarterback kellen lewis and wide receiver james hardy together they are one of the most exciting duos in the game " to take the true measure of the coach dayton daily news columnist tom archdeacon goes back to his tenure at miami of ohio "through jim place then chaminade juliennes coach he met dominic bramante an otoe missouria indian whod taken over the beleaguered football team of poverty stricken riverside indian school in anadarko okla at one point the team had lost straight games " mr archdeacon writes "hoeppner would bring bramante and his team to oxford for his weeklong summer camp hed provide room board food and clothes on one visit bramante was close to tears as he talked about hoeppner hes a great supporter of the native american cause but its more than that you can see it in the way he deals with everybody hes just a good good man thats who we lost " a day after tiger woods finished second at the u s open his wife elin gave birth to their first child a daughter named sam alexis woods much of the golf world is fixated on the question how will being sams father affect tigers golf game many commentators agree with the orlando sentinels andrew carter who

register columnist jeff miller says fans need to get used to living with such me first stars if it isnt kobe in l a itll be his replacement "ask yourself whos bigger brett favre or the rest of the green bay packers terrell owens or the some others sentenced to share a locker room with him barry bonds or the collective little giants if the atlanta falcons didnt have michael vick would they have an identity would they have a purpose would they have a franchise " asks mr miller "the crescendo of the recent nba playoffs was sold as lebron james debut in the finals so as commentators all over the country failed to properly pronounce the name varejao it barely was noted that the cavaliers as an organization never had been in the finals either " the sacramento kings hired former king reggie

coach knowing that hell be gone in two years but hey what a two years he would have been a hoot and a hollerer and one incredible upgrade on the sideline " ms voisin writes "who out there didnt imagine the possibilities mike bibby guarding the ball ron artest put in his place in the huddle brad miller badgered into shape francisco garcia kevin martin and quincy douby schooled by the master
