me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q i have to purchase a minivan that can fit three child safety seats chrysler offers significant rebates on town &amp country but i have read more positive reviews on the honda odyssey and toyota sienna is the price premium on the japanese vans worth paying jason sturman indianapolis a if you really enjoy driving the premium may seem paltry after miles at the wheel of a van you find sluggish and boring still the last honda odyssey i drove was easily the most fun to drive of the large vans i have tried it accelerated quickly and smoothly and handled well enough to make me look forward to back road driving id test drive the honda and chrysler for a comparison q my wife is set on buying new mainly because she thinks any used car is a lemon what can i do to convince her that buying used wont leave us stranded scott aronowitz bayside n y a buying used is a great way to avoid the often staggering loss of value from depreciation that accompanies nearly every new car purchase cars now are generally better built and last longer so cars a few years old often are capable of many thousands of miles of additional reliable service perhaps the best way to begin the discussion with your wife is to mention that many used cars are still covered by their original warranties manufacturers and dealers increasingly offer hour roadside assistance which may ease worries of getting a lemon which can also happen with new cars q i own a bmw series with run flat tires the "advantage" is that you have no spare saving weight and space the disadvantage is having a holiday blowout to find no way to replace the tire are you hearing similar complaints john mctavish bonita springs fla a run flat tires are near the top of my list of pet peeves i find them almost as useless as the current generation of "smart" keys that were apparently designed to be misplaced in many regions you must travel more than miles to find a bmw dealership or other tire outlet that might by some miracle actually stock the tire you need and once you are stuck waiting for a back ordered tire during what is supposed to be a vacation an old fashioned spare and its accompanying jack will start looking like a great invention
