company last summer yahoo board members decided that mr yang would succeed mr semel on a temporary basis if the ceo died suddenly according to one acquaintance close to mr yang another person familiar with the matter says that several directors agreed late last week that mr semel needed to move on especially given that the weakness in yahoos traditional display ad business meant the company could

announcement to the board sunday had been under way for a while he now serves as nonexecutive chairman in any case the ceo job may be mr yangs to keep if he proves a great chief executive "he will be ceo for a long time " the longtime acquaintance says a yahoo spokeswoman said mr yang wasnt available to comment for this article but she added that mr yang has "been in an executive leadership role at yahoo since day one its not like a leadership role is new for him " mr yang emigrated to san jose calif from taiwan when he was with his mother a widowed english and drama professor and his younger

founders icons of the modern internet age mr yangs role as chief yahoo wasnt always well understood but as a director and member of the executive committee he helped to shape strategy and assumed responsibility for key projects according to people close to yahoo in the late s when yahoo was lagging in e commerce mr yang immersed himself in developing products and business deals to boost that area in when yahoos top management and directors moved to develop their own web search expertise and reduce their dependence on technology from rival google inc they had mr yang get that effort off the ground mr yang was also instrumental in recruiting mr semel in and has spent years helping to build yahoos international business while mr yang wasnt a permanent ceo "hes been half in that chair almost from the day i met him and now he just gets the full seat " says jeff mallett who was at yahoo from to including as president and chief operating officer and is now chairman of online music

focused on web design innovation grew in part because of such support a person close to the company says over the years mr yang won the loyalty of many employees he and mr filo now yahoos interim chief technology officer have donned big sumo costumes to wrestle before employees on a central lawn at yahoo headquarters hes also an avid golfer known to pace during meetings with a putter in his hands in february mr yang scored a hole in one on the fifth hole of the famed pebble beach course still some staffers have wondered at times whether mr yangs attention was more on his golf game than the company in recent years google has pulled ahead in search and online advertising as yahoo has struggled with its own delayed ad system upgrade amid fretting by some senior executives that yahoo had lost focus "the internal perception of jerry is that hes laid back and not that involved in the day to day operation of the business " says a person close to the company "he still seems a little bit of a gentleman founder " mr yangs "tremendous passion and work ethic has continued throughout his years here " counters the yahoo spokeswoman another person close to the company questions how prepared mr yang will be to make the tough decisions required to right yahoo since he has helped shape its current strategy in a web post on yahoos site titled "my new job " mr yang said he and ms decker share a vision of a yahoo "that executes with speed clarity and discipline " other elements of the vision he cited included differentiating products investing in innovation and better

successfully " says gary e hayes a managing partner at hayes brunswick &amp partners an organizational and management development consultancy in new york but management experts say fixing yahoo could prove a lot tougher for mr yang than launching the enterprise to regain the companys competitive edge he must hit the ground running without relying too much on mr semel "jerry wont be able to do much unless he can bring back that entrepreneurial spirit " says john sullivan a management professor at san francisco state universitys business school the new ceo should take dramatic steps to quickly rebuild yahoos market credibility and restore staff morale other management specialists suggest "mr yangs job will be to figure out how he wants the furniture broken " says kevin coyne a strategy
