ceos words may cook whole foods federal antitrust officials aim to use the words of whole foods market inc chairman and chief executive john mackey as a tool against the company as they move to block the natural food chains purchase of rival wild oats markets inc in its june lawsuit a more detailed version of which became available yesterday the federal trade commission quoted mr mackey as telling fellow directors in internal documents that buying wild oats would enable the company to "avoid nasty price wars" that could "harm whole foods gross margins and profitability" in portland ore nashville tenn boulder colo and other cities the agency in the complaint filed in a federal court in washington d c said mr mackey also told the board that the &# million deal would eliminate the possibility that a major conventional supermarket chain such as kroger co would create a competing national natural foods retailer wild oats "is the only existing company that has the brand and number of stores to be a meaningful springboard for another player " he said according to the suit the agency yesterday released mr mackeys statements which had been redacted from the original complaint the government is highlighting mr mackeys comments which it obtained from the company while reviewing the merger to bolster its contention that the deal would reduce competition and raise prices for consumers among the newly disclosed material is the commissions contention that whole foods intends after acquiring wild oats to close "numerous" wild oats stores sell others and operate the remainder as whole foods outlets last night mr mackey vehemently challenged the ftcs assertions in a voluminous entry on his blog on the companys web site he accused the government of "bullying tactics" and said it was taking internal conversations many of them by email out of context in order to bolster its argument "they arent going to place" internal correspondence "in their proper context " he wrote adding that many statements by executives were merely part of brainstorming sessions or "macho posturing" common to any competitive organization mr mackey blasted the agency for failing to "bother to actually gather any pricing information from whole foods or wild oats" as part of its critique of the merger mr mackey also wrote "if eliminating a competitor is inherently bad or wrong then the ftc should probably never allow any mergers to ever occur " in an interview jim sud executive vice president of growth and development for whole foods said the company is at "a severe disadvantage" in trying to fight the ftcs stance "they have the power to subpoena whatever documents they want " he said "its been very one sided " whole foods which has submitted more than million internal documents to the agency hasnt made any decisions about how many wild oats stores it might close if the deal goes through mr sud added the company lacks financial information about the wild oats stores on which to base such decisions a wild oats spokeswoman declined to comment other companies had worried that the commissions complaint might signal more aggressive antitrust enforcement in washington but that concern could ease with the knowledge that the commissions case appears to be based largely on the companies own words the core of the argument against the deal is that whole foods and wild oats are essentially the two leading competitors in a distinct market for premium organic foods according to this argument conventional food retailers such as wal mart stores inc and kroger dont really count even as they increasingly offer similar products in pursuit of higher profit margins for instance the lawsuit quotes mr mackey as saying that organic foods are "only one part of its highly successful business model " citing as others "superior quality superior service and superior store experience " the lawsuit quotes mr mackey as saying "wal mart doesnt sell high quality perishables" and that is "why wal mart isnt going to hurt whole foods " karen burk a wal mart spokeswoman said the company has "to be doing something right if million customers shop our stores every week " whole foods of austin texas agreed in february to buy wild oats of boulder colo for &# a share whole foods argues the ftc is defining the natural foods sector too narrowly stressing that kroger and other chains have been expanding their selection of such foods and even redesigning stores to look more like whole foods locations whole foods says in a document on its web site that it faces "substantial" competition from conventional stores and smaller natural foods outlets when the government sued it filed its complaint and supporting materials under court seal because they contained proprietary business information the wall street journal owned by dow jones &amp co sent a letter to judge paul l friedman asking him to unseal many documents saying the issues are of public interest june the ftc sought to have the full text of its complaint released and monday whole foods and wild oats said they wouldnt object in p m composite trading yesterday on the nasdaq stock market shares of whole foods were
