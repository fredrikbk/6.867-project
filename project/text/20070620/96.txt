real estate finance healthy asset medical offices niche gains favor as investors discover strong fundamentals reits like the demographics after years of flying under the radar medical office buildings are emerging as an attractive commercial real estate asset thanks to strong fundamentals and sky high prices for other types of properties medical office buildings or mobs represent a tiny niche of the broader office building sector they have often been overlooked not only because they lack the pizazz of gleaming skyscrapers but because their complex operating structures can scare off traditional office investors analysts say now with so much capital chasing all types of commercial real estate "mobs have become more mainstream and a growing number of capital providers are now investing in the sector " says jim sullivan an analyst at green street advisors a real estate research firm in newport beach calif health care real estate investment trusts including many of the nations largest ones have been among the most aggressive buyers last month health care reit inc based in toledo ohio acquired mobs across states healthcare realty trust inc nashville tenn is close to selling the last of its senior housing properties which had a total value of &# million so it can focus exclusively on mobs its original business jerry doctrow an analyst at stifel nicolaus &amp co in baltimore notes that at a recent reit industry conference certain health care reits said they were turning to mobs partly because the price of one of their mainstay holdings private pay senior housing has been bid up by competitors these reits are also uncomfortable with the risks of remaining lesser quality properties available in the marketplace mobs are seen as an attractive alternative in part because health care reits believe the baby boomers eligible for medicare at age will have more time to head to the doctor upon retirement "mobs are where the baby boomers are going to touch the health care system first " says debra cafaro chief executive of ventas inc a health care reit based in louisville ky that is looking to expand its mob holdings another plus rent growth is steadier than in traditional office buildings where imbalances in supply and demand have historically resulted in volatility says green streets mr sullivan tenant retention rates tend to be high particularly in buildings located on hospital campuses "the tenants are doctors who have patients who are being treated at that adjacent hospital and that creates a strong tenant demand we like that " says mark wallace chief financial officer of health care property investors inc the nations biggest health care reit by market value mobs are now of the long beach calif based reits total portfolio up from at the end of shortened hospital stays also work in favor of mobs adds richard anderson a senior reit analyst at bmo capital markets "thats a really good trend that isnt going to reverse " he says mobs also have some risks analysts note they tend to be management intensive "doctors can be difficult tenants because theyve got bigger things to talk about than rent payments " says mr anderson medicare can also cause complications in a mob there can be lots of doctors dealing with different specialties all subject to myriad forms of medicare reimbursement "if for any reason medicare takes a hit that can be an issue in the valuation of the building " says mr anderson and although not as pricey as some other types of commercial real estate mob assets and the reits that own them are becoming more expensive because investors consider them prime takeover candidates the fact that four of the biggest health care reits have signaled their intention to expand into the sector could drive prices up even more in addition certain non reits and traditional office reits have increased their mob holdings some analysts expect increased interest from private equity firms that have snapped up other forms of real estate though the management nuances of running a mob portfolio could make it a more difficult transaction for firms that often quickly sell off rather than manage properties the recent focus on mobs has caused capitalization rates or the return on investment during the first year of ownership to compress just as it has with other property types mr anderson says that mobs have become increasingly expensive relative to historic pricing "the cap rate for a good quality mob is well into the range whereas the cap rate for a good quality traditional office building can be below " adds mr anderson but that of course could soon change some equity analysts are assuming a higher increase in capitalization rates over the next year across all sectors because of higher debt costs and modestly slower growth assumptions married to the mob several big reits have bolstered their holdings of medical office buildings or mobs in may health care reit inc acquired buildings across states and a property management firm for &# million in february duke realty corp closed its acquisition of bremner healthcare real estate to give it a foothold in the sector healthcare realty trust inc is selling senior housing properties to focus exclusively on medical office buildings health care property investors inc has grown its mobs to of its total portfolio from at the end of source the
