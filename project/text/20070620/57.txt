home builders cut output lending support to prices the nations home builders continued to cut production last month as they struggled to pare bloated inventories housing starts fell in may to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of million from million in april the commerce department said starts were down from a year earlier and from their peak rate in january building permits which are required in most localities before construction can begin rose last month but much of the gain was a result of permits for apartment buildings demand for apartments has been growing as rising interest rates and tighter lending standards have encouraged more families to rent a home instead of purchase one building permits overall increased in may but single family home permits fell while permits for apartments gained the slowdown in building activity coupled with reports of rising foreclosures and declining confidence among builders could mean the tumbling housing market has yet to hit a trough "things arent going to get better anytime soon " said drew matus senior u s economist at lehman brothers mr matus said that yesterdays report suggests that builders are trying to rebalance the market by cutting supply instead of prices a decision he said that is better for builders and for the economy as a whole "we economists prefer to see a volume adjustment rather than a price adjustment " he said falling home prices can make homeowners feel less wealthy prompting them to reduce spending that in turn can slow economic growth "what you really want to see happen is a balance between supply and demand in the market " mr matus said other analysts however said further price cuts are inevitable as inventories of unsold homes keep growing partly because of rising foreclosures the inventory of existing homes for sale has risen nearly since last year according to the national association of realtors at the current rate of sales it would take months to sell all the previously owned homes now on the market that was twice as long as the average in and "were going to have to see far more significant price declines to start moving this inventory " said richard moody chief economist at mission residential an austin texas apartment building owner referring to the single family home market "its taking really significant price cuts and incentives to move these units " "i dont call it a recession because theres no official definition of a housing recession but we are in that league in terms of a setback " said david seiders chief economist of the national association of home builders he said that much of the recent weakness reflects tighter lending standards as well as the meltdown in the market for subprime mortgages home loans made to consumers with shaky credit climbing interest rates in the past month have also nudged up mortgage rates mr seiders said the housing market is weaker than he initially thought and he expects housing starts to drop throughout the rest of "the bottom has not yet been reached " he said
