fit for a king a lully opera in period style boston the centerpiece of the biennial boston early music festival is always an opera performed and staged in period style this years project was an outstanding production of jean baptiste lullys "psyche" receiving its north american premiere the boston performances at the cutler majestic theater concluded on sunday but fans of the french baroque should hurry to the berkshires where three more performances can be seen at the mahaiwe performing arts center in great barrington this weekend this "psyche" makes its audience feel like members of a th century french royal court experiencing its art as an immediate living creation there is nothing modern about it which is what makes it special the opera is a sumptuous pageant that deftly combines singing and dance its story is not really a drama but a vehicle for a salute to king louis xiv written in a prologue and five acts the piece which ran hours with one intermission demands that the audience relax into its pacing and formality while enjoying its extravagant visual and musical pleasures "psyche " with a libretto by pierre corneille tells the mythological story of the beautiful mortal who arouses the jealousy of venus venus sends her son cupid to deal with the upstart but cupid himself falls in love furious venus does her best to destroy psyche with tricks and a journey to the underworld but at last jupiter intervenes makes psyche immortal and all is well according to the bemf scholars the opera is a celebration of the king and his famous mistress madame de montespan they are cupid and psyche and the opera is a paean to the power of love before whom all gods and mortals must surrender set designer caleb wertenbaker and lighting designer lenore doxsee made the relatively simple set a blue floor beautifully painted with stars tall green hedges on the sides and an elegant fence across the front that was opened and closed to signal the beginning and the end of each act look rich it was a fine frame for anna watkinss gorgeous th century costumes for the enormous cast of singers and dancers in this context the flying effects venus descends in a "machine " cupid via wires and psyche is whisked into the flies were a charming surprise and one forgot to be jaded by the more elaborate wonders of modern stage technology director gilbert blin choreographer lucy graham and musical directors paul odette and stephen stubbs balanced text singing dancing and staging to create an unusually organic and vivid performance the engine was the large and splendid period instrument orchestra led by violinist robert mealy it sat in two rows facing each other just below the stage apron with basses and percussion on the left and the six member continuo group on the right the continuo players including mr odette and mr stubbs playing theorbos large lutes and guitars had the majority of the work as they accompanied all the arias and recitatives and their close musical connection to the singers gave the performance an improvisatory vigor much of the delight in "psyche" arises from the integration of dancing and singing allegorical pageants open and close the work but dance also plays an integral part in story portions of the opera for example when cupid and psyche meet in act ii singing and dancing nymphs cupids and zephyrs little breezes express the lovers feelings the baroque style dancing was excellent and wonderfully varied ranging from decorous pastoral moments to witty commedia dellarte style ones among the highlights an enchanting group of "little cupids" from the pals childrens chorus some frightening demons in the underworld and a hilarious assembly of stomping cyclopses appropriately masked charged with building a palace for psyche bemf also fielded a solid cast of singers many of them quite young carolyn sampson brought a gentle delicacy to the role of psyche karina gauvin made a forceful and vindictive venus the two struck sparks in their confrontations which were all the more special for being rare everyone else played multiple roles standouts included teresa wakim amanda forsythe and yulia van doren zachary wilder jason mcstoots and olivier laquerre were ferociously funny as furies wearing th century drag in the underworld ms van doren richard bordas and douglas williams sang an affecting italian trio to mourn the impending death of psyche who is about to be sacrificed to a marauding serpent dont ask and tenor colin balzer did a comic star turn as vulcain hes married to venus but in charge of building psyches palace tenor aaron sheehan sang cupid disguised as a man boy soprano jake wilder smith played him in his godlike form unlike handel operas which stand or fall on singers who can navigate lots of virtuosic ornamentation french baroque operas are built on excellent text declamation and the singers coached in style and gesture by ellen hargis did a fine job of it eloquently capturing the ebb and flow of lullys speech centered settings along with the improvisatory quality of the orchestral and continuo playing and the carefully calibrated direction and choreography it added up to an exquisite and vibrant realization of something that would otherwise be lost in the past some smart presenter should grab it and bring it to new york paris and beyond ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
