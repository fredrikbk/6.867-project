politics &amp economics u s intensifies immigrant raids escalation comes as bush encounters pressure over proposed overhaul brooklyn n y jeffrey dorant said he was rolling out of bed to wake his daughter yesterday before starting his day as a car salesman when loud knocks came at the front door it had taken nine years after a judge ordered mr dorant to be deported to his native trinidad and tobago for immigration agents to finally catch up with him the year old is now in jail pending a final decision on his deportation the raid involving mr dorant was part of a new initiative by the department of homeland securitys immigration and customs enforcement division to intensify a crackdown on fugitive aliens these immigrants are defined as those who are living in the country illegally or who lost their legal status because of criminal convictions but have been released pending appeals or other steps in the deportation process in the past many fugitive aliens have disappeared into the diaspora of newcomers spread across the country before their hearings apparently gambling federal immigration agents wouldnt be able to find them because of the backlog of court cases the government had effectively turned a blind eye to the problem in recent years as the number of these fugitive aliens increased they are currently estimated to top now immigration officials said they are for the first time making headway in tracking down such illegal immigrants and deporting them the push comes as the bush administration encounters pressure from critics of its immigration policy to show more muscle in enforcing existing laws conservatives in particular say they cant support a comprehensive immigration overhaul proposal now on life support in the senate on the grounds it would provide "amnesty" for the estimated million undocumented immigrants believed to be living in the u s conservatives also say that judging from the past they dont trust the administrations enforcement promises made in the overhaul proposal the initiative is being driven by homeland security secretary michael chertoff who also is the administrations point man in promoting its immigration overhaul the initiative is aimed at showing that the governments enforcement efforts go beyond raids of factories and immigrant neighborhoods those have often garnered negative publicity with photos of parents being ripped away from their children the enforcement division said that as of this month it had reduced by the number of fugitive immigrants to from in october between and the fugitive list increased by an average of people a month or more than a year of more than illegal immigrants arrested last year more than were fugitives the agency said the others were immigrants about whom the agency didnt previously know immigration officials said the change is coming as a result of new strategies including ending the agencys "catch and release" policy which essentially allowed immigrants to disappear instead they are being housed in detention centers while they await hearings officials also credit better computers stricter detention procedures and the availability of more beds in immigration detention centers the agency said it is deploying more "fugitive operation teams " with as many as teams by the end of this year up from in enforcement division officials said the fugitive crackdown is a priority mr dorant who has lived in the u s since he was lost his legal status after being convicted of gun possession and robbery according to enforcement division records he said he has lived a clean life since his run ins with the law in the early s yesterday he was tearful as he worried about his year old daughter a u s citizen whom he left at his apartment in the care of a sister in law "i dont know whats going to happen to my little girl i dont know if i have a chance to get before a judge to show how ive changed " enforcement officials said mr dorant can choose whether to return to trinidad and tobago with his child or to leave her with a guardian in the u s "we will help him facilitate whichever decision he makes " said enforcement division spokesman marc raimondi some critics said the timing of the raids seemed aimed at winning over hard line critics of the administration eric gutierrez washington based counsel for the mexican american legal defense and educational fund said the new tactics often split families and the agency should allow for additional hearings in cases in which immigrants being deported are the main caregivers for their families "were not saying dont deport criminal aliens were saying put strategies in place to do this in a humane way " he said julie myers assistant secretary of homeland security for immigration denied that the tougher enforcement tactics have anything to do with the debate on pending legislation "we cannot simply sit around and bend at the whims of public opinion " she said in an interview she said the agency has made sure children arent abandoned after such raids and parents are allowed to arrange for the care of their families homeland security officials are inviting reporters along on raids this week as part of a wider effort to show they can pursue tough tactics to protect americans while also handling the processing of million undocumented immigrants who may eventually attain legal status under legislation supported by president bush john torres director of detention and removal operations for the enforcement division acknowledged the department has fallen behind on deportations he said the agency is trying to learn from companies that are masters of logistics such as wal mart stores inc and united parcel service inc to improve tracking of its deportation caseload "you want to be able to know where everyone is at all times " he said "when you think of the amount of inventory that wal mart keeps track of or how ups keeps track of packages thats the direction were going next year " some of those netted in the raids are taking it in stride one year old man pulled from hiding in his mothers closet in an apartment on coney island yesterday exhibited bravado when agents hauled him into a detention center "let me go back home to be free " he said "in my country i have land i have no worries just let me go home "
