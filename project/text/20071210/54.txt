philanthropy a special report a new way the chief executive of united way talks about the challenges facing the organization once a darling of corporate america its reputation had been badly tarnished in the early s when the groups longtime national leader was sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud tax evasion and conspiracy united way has shifted its focus from raising money for charity in the workplace to helping communities decide their most pressing issues and figuring out ways to deal with them in early brian gallagher was catapulted out of columbus ohio and into the hot seat after a year career inside united way of america the last five running the columbus affiliate mr gallagher was named chief executive of the year old parent organization at the time united way was struggling once a darling of corporate america its reputation had been badly tarnished in the early s when the groups longtime national leader was sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud tax evasion and conspiracy in the groups board hired mckinsey &amp co a management consulting firm to help overhaul its mission and operations still as the economy tilted toward recession in united ways vaunted fund raising machine was faltering campaign money raised by the groups network of affiliates fell to &# billion in from &# billion a year earlier as incoming ceo mr gallagher embraced many of mckinseys recommendations such as shrinking the groups board but he rejected advice to quickly close a huge swath of affiliates opting instead for a more gradual consolidation "what you learn in these jobs is that there are certain battles you dont fight certain alleys you dont go down in the first couple or three years on the job " he says indeed there was more pain to come in united ways former washington d c chief pleaded guilty to stealing almost &# last year the new york city affiliate disclosed that its former head took &# in funds for personal use mr gallagher has used these episodes to help drive faster change membership requirements and reporting rules were significantly tightened and about affiliates have since closed or merged albeit more slowly than mckinsey recommended the biggest consolidation was in chicago once home to separate united ways and now down to a single united way of metropolitan chicago "it has started to grow again " says mr gallagher "because it is more efficient it is more effective " today united way affiliates are more focused on solving problems facing local communities mr gallagher says and donors seem to be responding fund raising has bounced back with revenue growing to &# billion "it has taken us almost four years to get to a place where i think we now have forward momentum " he says "we dont have to push this uphill anymore " significant challenges remain chief among them persuading the rest of the charitable sector to follow united ways lead in doing more to show donors how their dollars make a difference the son of a plumber mr gallagher was raised in hobart ind where he was one of six children his homemaker mother brought in extra income by reupholstering chairs he paid for college by doing construction work and a united way affiliate in atlanta picked up the tab for an m b a he earned from emory university below are edited excerpts from a recent conversation about challenges facing united way and charities at large the wall street journal united way has shifted its focus from raising money for charity in the workplace to helping communities decide their most pressing issues and figuring out ways to deal with them what is behind that shift mr gallagher the economic shift to a global knowledge based economy has changed all the social conditions in our communities and made more complex the social conditions that we and others have to deal with yet the graduation rates and poverty rates havent changed that much in the past years in this country we had to get ourselves back into the business of community results to figure why we have more and more families that cant sustain themselves wsj what is on your agenda in the next year mr gallagher i still dont believe that enough people maybe most people know what we stand for what do we do beside raising money and giving it to agencies we are going to have to get more specific we want to move to a common agenda for communities by focusing on education income and health kids have to be ready for school they have to stay in school they have to graduate we have got to do whatever we can to start closing the income gap in the country we have a role to play in starting to talk about how folks get access to health care wsj there is a big debate under way over the redesign of the form the public tax document the irs requires most charities to file each year what do you want to come out of this process mr gallagher i think it should go further in the results reporting area you shouldnt dictate to nonprofits exactly how to report results but you should dictate the fact that you have to report your results against your mission wsj what does united way disclose about its own community impact mr gallagher we have on our right now all the program areas we work on and how much progress we make in helping people increase their earned income tax credits job training numbers and so forth we report all of that on the which is on our public web site wsj why is it so hard for charities to measure their results mr gallagher in business the performance metrics are so much clearer than in most nonprofits there is a legitimate issue around getting clarity and some consistency about performance metrics but it is doable wsj do you think you will eventually meet mckinseys recommendation to further reduce the number of united ways mr gallagher i think there will be in the next five years significantly fewer united ways it is not even a cost issue as much as it is technology communication and integration you dont need separately incorporated local united ways throughout a market area wsj what about the composition of nonprofit boards which are often large mr gallagher some nonprofits have fallen into the trap of "you have got to have a person of certain influence in order to attract resources into the organization " i think that is a mistake if the organization has a significant fund raising role which most do create a different group to do that what you need is an inclusive board inclusive of everything you can think of in terms of skills geography race ethnicity gender experience age because those boards help you innovate the most impressive business leaders dont want to hang out all the time necessarily with just business leaders they want to hang out with smart people who actually think differently from how they do because they learn from that wsj what should a donor look for in a charity mr gallagher first can the organization articulate for me the magnitude of change they are aiming for over a specific period of time on objectives directly related to their mission so if you are in the education business how many more kids stayed in school how many more kids graduated the second is the cost of doing business is it transparent if a donor cant get to your information really easily that should tell them something and if they can that should also tell them something the third is leadership look at the board look at a management team in nonprofits i always bet on leadership businesses do it all the time wsj why is it so hard for many charities and foundations to share information with outsiders mr gallagher i think a lot of nonprofits have not yet realized that there are environmental forces at work that are making us public organizations as soon as you get that in your institutional head then you realize it is a lot better to let folks have access to the information they want if you take money from the public you are a public organization i believe the public is actually starving for honesty about where we are struggling and where we are having some success wsj what will be on the agenda of the nonprofit sector as a whole this year mr gallagher standards and self regulation around accountability and transparency we have to get as much of that implemented throughout the sector as possible that will be a priority wsj what looming legislative or regulatory threat are you most worried about mr gallagher the increasing discussion about what is a nonprofit are the lines blurring between for profit and nonprofit i think is going to be an important national conversation it is a complicated discussion and topic sometimes legislation is not a precise strategy it can be reactionary at times you can do a lot of damage
