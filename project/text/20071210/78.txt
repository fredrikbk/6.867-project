profit slump deepens recession worries the recession in reported earnings has already begun " says david rosenberg chief u s economist at merrill lynch &amp co "the underlying cause is a combination of painfully high energy prices and the general lack of pricing power in many businesses which is starting to crimp margins the weaker dollar played a role by making american goods more attractive to foreign buyers and helping boost the bottom lines of u s companies when earnings in stronger foreign currencies were translated back into dollars at the end of each quarter u s corporate profits are being hammered by the slowing economy and credit market turmoil intensifying concerns that the nation may be headed for recession banks and other financial companies which have taken huge write downs on soured bets on subprime mortgages have been among the most visible casualties but businesses ranging from makers of artificial hips to surf wear retailers to overnight delivery services are also feeling the pinch if profits fall far enough it could discourage capital spending and make companies less willing to hire or retain workers a hiring slowdown could magnify the downturn and hasten a recession thats bad news for wage earners as well as those who own stocks weaker profits ultimately translate into lower stock prices which could further erode the confidence of american consumers who are already feeling less wealthy as fuel costs rise and their home values decline "the recession in reported earnings has already begun " says david rosenberg chief u s economist at merrill lynch &amp co "the underlying cause is a combination of painfully high energy prices and the general lack of pricing power in many businesses which is starting to crimp margins " mr rosenberg estimates profits measured by the operating earnings per share of companies in the standard &amp poors stock index fell in the third quarter from a year earlier he expects those earnings to be flat or lower for the next five quarters companies with most of their business inside the u s are hurting most merrill estimates "domestic earnings " or profits derived from activities inside the u s have contracted in three of the past four quarters and have shrunk more than for the year the worst reading in that gauge since the fourth quarter of most economists expect things to get worse before they get better

in its outlook for the fall until recently strong foreign sales were a saving grace for many u s multinationals offsetting softening markets at home and bolstering overall profits the weaker dollar played a role by making american goods more attractive to foreign buyers and helping boost the bottom lines of u s companies when earnings in stronger foreign currencies were translated back into dollars at the end of each quarter but the downdraft in the u s economy is now overwhelming those benefits economists say in s first two quarters s&amp p operating earnings rose at a high single digit pace from a year earlier before dropping into negative territory in the third period that weakness followed a remarkable growth run through the quarters ended with the fourth quarter of earnings grew at a double digit pace richard berner chief u s economist at morgan stanley expects a "significant and lengthy" contraction in earnings even if the u s economy avoids a recession next year thats because u s companies have far more operating leverage now than at any time in the past companies with high operating leverage have relatively high fixed costs such as retail chains that must pay rent on dozens of stores regardless of how much is sold at each location or a manufacturer with factories full of expensive machines that must be maintained even if they arent churning out products "because of operating leverage when the economy really slows down you get a much more pronounced impact on profits and earnings " says mr berner because company results are hurt simultaneously by lower sales and thinner profit margins he says if the u s economy grows only or next year overall earnings might slip to but if growth is lower say flat to earnings could fall by to meanwhile more
