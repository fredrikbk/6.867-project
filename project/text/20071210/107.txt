wall streets holiday rush tradition of heavy year end shuffling to address tax losses dress up funds creates opportunities as the new year approaches wall street not times square might be the best spot in new york to see people toss out the old and bring in the new the stock market crowd usually gets a head start on the new years festivities and then keeps partying december and january are typically good months for stocks with increases averaging more than in the dow jones industrial average each month as many investors trade stocks for reasons that have nothing to do with profits interest rates and the like in december investors tend to sell stocks that have posted big year to date losses so they can write off those losses on their taxes meanwhile money managers sometimes buy the years big winners so the names show up on year end statements for clients a practice known as window dressing and many participants big and small go bargain hunting in january among the tax loss victims after a wild year in the market that included two declines of around and sectors such as financials and consumer discretionary stocks way down some expect year end buying and selling to be stronger than in the past few placid years studies also show that the impact of hedge funds which are intensely focused on one year gains could increase the effect as they swoop in to buy stocks that have fallen too far or jump on the hot names in the hope of adding a bit of juice to their performance year end shuffling has kept barry james president of james investment research in alpha ohio busy lately he said his research and asset management firm which handles more than &# billion in customer accounts for tax reasons has been selling losers such as financial services concern cit group off this year toy maker mattel off and retailer j c penney off mr james who said he will surely have to do more tax related selling during the next few weeks said he believes such activity could be especially prevalent this year because of the markets volatility the dow industrials for example have had days of point plus moves up or down compared with the average of nearly days for the prior three years december historically is the strongest month for the dow industrials with an average rise in the month going back to according to ned davis research in venice fla so far this year seems even better the industrials rose last week to and are up this year but just as investors tend to start their seasonal revelry early they have to be careful this year because weak fundamentals facing the market tepid profits mortgage related losses and weak consumer spending could more than offset the end of year related action "weve had some encouraging news lately on the macroeconomic front " including the strong jobs report from the labor department on friday said russ koesterich head of investment strategy at barclays global investors in san francisco "but by no means are all the concerns out of the way yet right now you have to focus on that at least as much as the historical seasonality in the market " battered by the mortgage mess and the credit squeeze financial stocks are down about this year the worst performing sector in the standard &amp poors stock index this makes them likely candidates for tax loss selling which could drive them down even further before year end smaller stocks in particular can feel the pain of tax loss selling they also could rise later if investors with cash on hand go bargain hunting the same is true for the consumer discretionary sector which is down nearly this year hurt by concerns that slowing economic growth may prompt americans to cut back purchases of unnecessary items the years biggest winner has been the energy sector boosted by a nearly rise in crude oil prices technology companies with the highest proportion of overseas revenue of any sector in the s&amp p also posted solid increases because of the fast growing economies of china and other emerging markets those stocks could rise further by year end if money managers decide they should have more of them in their portfolios ned davis analyst john laforge said the phenomenon of tax loss selling followed by bargain hunting is difficult to measure based on his study of a window beginning in late october he said he believes the approach may be working increasingly well for investors at the end of the year in order to book tax losses for a year mutual funds must dump losing stocks by oct mr laforge looked at how investors would do if they bought the biggest market losers at the end of october and sold them dec in the past that strategy was a loser for the past six years it beat the s&amp p every year by an average of more than seven percentage points "i dont think its coincidental that this is the same period when youve had an increased number of hedge funds active in the market " mr laforge said theyre much more opportunistic willing to pounce on what some might call the inefficiency of other people being motivated to sell for reasons that have nothing to do with fundamentals " if that is indeed what is driving the market now mr laforge said hedge funds may be likely to snatch up losers in december or january after other investors have done their tax related selling a late november report by research firm thomson financial which studied historic trends in the djia and s&amp p reached similar conclusions predicting that market yardsticks seemed poised for a rally of at least through the end of the year like the dow industrials the s&amp p is up more than since the report including a rise of in the first week of trading this month james investment researchs mr james isnt likely to be among the bargain hunters in early "we think were going to get a pretty serious recession next year which would be consistent with a market decline " he said he is in the minority in predicting an economic downturn but analysts and investors will be watching for the written statement from federal reserve policy makers after their meeting tomorrow for hints of what is to come
