u s mortgage crisis rivals s&amp l meltdown toll of economic shocks may linger for years a global credit crunch until the mess is cleaned up investors will remain jittery and banks will likely hold back on all kinds of lending a credit crunch that is already damping global growth and could tip the u s economy into recession the home has long been the bedrock asset of most american families now its value has become the biggest question mark hanging over the global economy and financial system over the past decade wall street built a market for more than &# trillion in securities sold globally and backed by loans to u s homeowners on two long accepted beliefs and one newer one the prevailing logic the value of the american home would never fall nationwide and people would almost always make their mortgage payments the more recent twist packaging mortgage loans and turning them into securities would make the global economy more resilient if anything went wrong in a matter of months though much of the promise of the new financial architecture together with its underlying assumptions has proven to be a mirage as house prices fall and homeowners default on mortgages at troubling rates the pain has spread far and wide an examination of the resulting crisis shows that it is comparable to some of the biggest financial disasters of the past half century so far the potential losses look manageable compared with the savings and loan crisis of the s and the tech stock crash of but the housing debacle could yet take years to work out thanks to the sheer complexity of it until the mess is cleaned up investors will remain jittery and banks will likely hold back on all kinds of lending a credit crunch that is already damping global growth and could tip the u s economy into recession the new financial system shifting risk from banks to securities markets has worked "pretty well" up until now says former federal reserve chairman paul volcker "were going to find out if it works well for a major league crisis " to ease the pain the federal reserve has cut short term interest rates twice and is expected to cut them further tomorrow the bush administration has also pressed for private sector curative measures first it urged big banks to create a new entity to buy some mortgage linked securities that dont have a ready market now and a plan finalized last week calls for freezing interest payments on perhaps hundreds of thousands of qualifying homeowners whose mortgage notes are set to rise both ideas are controversial they are hailed by some as well conceived financial first aid and criticized by others as inadequate or an impediment to crisis resolution veteran financiers see in the current episode a pattern consistent with classic financial manias investors enthusiasm for an asset in this case u s houses drove up prices attracted more capital and lifted prices to levels that preordained a fall home prices rose sharply elsewhere too including in the united kingdom parts of continental europe and australia "old fogies like me expected the bust to come earlier than it did " says george soros the year old chairman of soros fund management "a lot of us got tired waiting for it " the ultimate extent of the crisis will depend largely on how steeply the price of the average american home falls that will play a pivotal role in determining how many people are at risk of foreclosure as payments on adjustable rate mortgages tick upward and in the size of losses on securities backed by those loans it will also affect the size of the hit that consumers sustain to their spending power house prices are down by to now depending on the measure used if they fell what it would take to restore their historic relationship to inflation rents and incomes &# trillion worth of housing wealth would be wiped out measured against the size of the u s economy that is less than what was lost in the stock market between and initial guesses at total losses on subprime and similar mortgages range from &# billion to &# billion the latter figure would equal about of u s annual economic output that is similar to the losses suffered by s&amp ls and commercial banks between and but it is less than half the scale of japanese bank losses in the wake of that countrys burst stock and real estate bubbles the current crisis though differs in crucial ways from the recent tech stock bust and the s&amp l crisis for one it centers on assets houses that unlike stocks most people have bought with borrowed money on average mortgage debt amounts to nearly half the value of houses in recent years easy credit has allowed many to borrow up to the full value of their homes making them more leveraged than any hedge fund as prices fall people who find themselves owing more than their homes are worth are much more likely to renege on their mortgages leaving lenders to sell the foreclosed houses at a loss to make matters worse payments on more than &# billion in mortgages will reset in mostly to higher rates banks are far less exposed to serious damage than during the s nonetheless the shift of loans from banks to markets has created a staggering complexity that threatens to prolong the crisis during the latin american debt crisis the fed and u s treasury were able to prod a few hundred banks to renegotiate billions of dollars in debt owed by a few dozen developing countries "you had uncertainty in valuation but it was more straightforward you know how big the debt is you know who has it a relatively small group " says mr volcker "this is much more complex " mortgages today are dispersed among banks as well as more than investment pools each of which may have hundreds if not thousands of investors many of those pools have been further repackaged into specialized funds known as structured investment vehicles and collateralized debt obligations or sivs and cdos each of which have their own investors that makes determining who owns the securities what they are worth and the nature of the underlying collateral a tricky process david barse of third avenue management llc a new york investment firm specializing in distressed companies is steering clear of cdos for now he says he would need to hire new experts just to figure how much they are worth "we dont have the analytical systems to break them down " he says indeed coming up with a value for a cdo entails analyzing more than separate securities each of which contains several thousand individual loans a feat that if done on any scale can require millions of dollars in computing power alone recent deals such as a hedge funds purchase of the mortgage portfolio of e trade financial corp suggest markets are starting to sort things out but many investors are hanging back prolonging the uncertainty over markets and the economy housing fits a pattern mr soros has observed since he entered the investment business in the s economic fundamentals he posits are supposed to determine asset prices but often a flood of capital makes an assets fundamentals seem sounder than they really are attracting even more capital "eventually you reach a turning point " he says "where the value of the collateral begins to decline which reduces the willingness to lend which reinforces the fall in the value of the collateral " "there usually has to be a flaw in peoples perceptions to set a boom bust sequence into motion " mr soros says in the case of housing he says it was the assumption that because home prices fall nationwide only in a severe economic slump a diversified portfolio of u s mortgages made for a very safe investment robert shiller a yale university economist who has made a career out of studying bubbles says the last bear market in stocks may have also made houses more appealing a survey of home buyers he conducted with a colleague found times as many said the stock markets collapse encouraged them to buy a home as said it discouraged them their thinking mr shiller says went like this "im fed up with the stock market i had so many promises of high returns and my broker and the accountants were deceiving us but homes have always gone up in value and it gives me great satisfaction to own a home and i can see it everyday " at first home prices rose for good reason with the economy in recession the fed slashed interest rates in and kept them low until mid that plus an influx of foreign savings to the u s kept mortgage rates low former fed chairman alan greenspan frequently argued there could be no housing bubble the high cost and inconvenience of moving "are significant impediments to speculative trading and development of price bubbles " he said in late but rising home prices may have given both buyers and lenders a false sense of the markets stability and security chris delzio a securities broker in the pricier new york area moved to palm bay fla in and bought two town houses each for &# within two years he had sold both for double what he paid and plowed the profits into land to build five new homes compared to staring at a securities trading screen he says "it was fun driving around looking at the properties youre out talking negotiating " when the fed began to raise interest rates in mortgage rates also began to climb initially home prices kept rising as home buyers turned to mortgages with low initial payments assuming they could sell or refinance before the mortgage rate adjusted higher borrowers who had trouble making payments could easily buy more time by refinancing into bigger loans thanks to higher prices that kept defaults low and encouraged rating agencies to continue blessing securities backed by such mortgages with high ratings then in places like florida buyers stopped coming mr delzio listed one home on which he spent &# at &# he then cut the price repeatedly finally to &# barely more than the mortgage he now rents it for &# month well short of the &# monthly carrying cost selling is made all the more difficult by the ample supply of homes and vacant land for sale in the area nationally there were million vacant homes for sale in the third quarter equal to of all the homes in the country a record at the end of the value of all homes in the u s excluding rentals peaked at of gross domestic product or about &# trillion the highest level in at least six decades by sept that had edged down to of gdp as home prices began to drop with huge inventories of unsold homes soon to swell with foreclosed properties that is likely to continue falling home prices make consumers poorer and less ready to spend and they make it harder to borrow against home values even if consumers are current on their payments the downturn is particularly tough on those surrounded by foreclosed homes melissa pohlman and her husband bought a renovated home in north minneapoliss down at the heels jordan neighborhood three years ago for &# it was most recently assessed by the city at &# ms pohlman a year old pastor hoped it would eventually rise to &# at which point they would have enough equity to stop paying &# a month for private mortgage insurance but hundreds of homes in the area are being foreclosed and she doesnt even "want to know" what it is worth now "youre dealing with an already transient neighborhood and then you heap on top of that a ton of foreclosures there are a lot of vacant homes a lot of houses that are boarded up " the pressure on homeowners is only part of the picture a potentially bigger issue is the impact of this bad debt on banks and investors and their continued willingness to lend to consumers and businesses mortgage securities typically consist of or more different slices from highly rated slices for conservative investors all the way down to low rated riskier slices for investors looking for bigger returns each slice has its own set of rules governing when and how investors will get paid or suffer losses rising defaults can actually be good for some highly rated slices which get paid off faster as a result many lower rated slices though pay back the original investment only after three years and only on the condition that defaults remain low that means the value of a security issued in stands to be a big question mark until "maybe people will get wiped out maybe they wont we wont know until two or three years from now " says dan castro managing director at gsc group a new york based asset management firm that focuses on the mortgage market ken guy finance director of king county wash says the countys investment pool bought short term ious called commercial paper backed by several sivs because they appeared to be low risk "we relied heavily on the ratings agencies " he says about of his &# billion fund was invested in such paper when the mortgage backed assets held by the sivs suddenly started going bad some of his investments were downgraded all the way to "default " "how could this have happened so quickly " mr guy wondered with colleagues "how could these be downgraded from top to bottom in a day or two " such questions have been raised repeatedly "weve seen an unprecedented decline in market liquidity really beyond what we thought possible " says noel kirnon executive vice president in charge of structured finance at moodys investors service one of the two large ratings firms "ratings on sivs are significantly impacted by the market trends even when the underlying portfolio maintains its credit quality " says a spokesman with standard &amp poors the other large ratings firm the complexity of mortgage backed securities is making banks more vulnerable to losses than expected it turns out banks didnt manage to shed so much of the risk of lending by packaging mortgage loans into securities and selling them to investors instead they kept a large portion of the risk in various forms including pieces of the cdos they helped bring to market they also sometimes struck deals to provide emergency funding to sivs and managers of cdos obligations that werent always clearly spelled out in their financial statements such agreements with cdo vehicles led to much of the &# billion to &# billion in write downs that citigroup inc says it expects to suffer in the current quarter with mortgage losses mounting banks all over the world are shying away from risk swiss bank ubs ag recently announced four billion swiss francs &# billion in third quarter losses on securities backed by u s mortgages and has warned of more to come in the current quarter in one of a number of moves aimed at cutting back on risk the chief executive marcel rohner has said he plans to slash the investment banks assets by which means putting a lot less money into securities because everyone from auto dealers to main street banks now depends on securities markets as a source of credit as opposed to banks such moves could make it more difficult for consumers and companies to get money banks are also wary of lending to one another they are trying to keep as much cash as possible as a cushion against potential losses and they are worried that their counterparts could go belly up as a result they have been charging each other much higher interest rates those rates in turn affect monthly payments on millions of credit cards and mortgages in europe and the u s asset prices stop falling when markets conclude that all the bad news has been factored in at that point so called vulture investors pounce but most are holding back because they think banks and sivs could yet be forced to sell more of their holdings of subprime backed securities into a market with few buyers tcw group a los angeles asset management firm raised about &# billion over the summer in anticipation of finding distressed opportunities in the mortgage market but jeffrey gundlach chief investment officer says he has invested less than a quarter of those assets so far "the capital markets are littered with corpses of the people who thought subprime bonds were a good buy at and cents on the dollar " says mr gundlach a mortgage expert since the s he looks at depressed mortgage bonds for every one he buys in spite of the gloom the economy may avoid recession housing comprises a much smaller share of the economy than business investment which dragged the u s into recession in also the rest of the world is stronger than in boosting u s exports for the entire u s economy to contract would probably require a broad decline in consumer spending which hasnt happened since and while financial problems are serious they arent at least yet on a par with those of the s when many major banks would have been insolvent had they valued their third world loans accurately there is indeed a possibility that the opacity of todays mortgage securities means markets may be factoring in far larger losses than will actually occur though the fed is still worried about inflation it has plenty of room to cushion the economy with additional interest rate cuts but after years of living off the debt financed increases in the value of their homes u s consumers are in uncharted territory "a lot of people including me have been saying that the country has been spending more than its been producing and that will have to come to an end " says mr volcker "the question is does it come to an end with a bang or whimper " kelly evans contributed to this article
