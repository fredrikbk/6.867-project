philanthropy a special report editors note imagine you are shopping for a car you find one that costs &# and the dealer assures you that it will get you where you want to go but thats pretty much all you know youre clueless about how well it really drives or its repair history you have no idea what gas mileage it gets or how it fares in safety tests and theres no warranty youd walk away of course yet in many respects thats the position people are in when they donate to a charity they know the basic facts what the charitys mission is and how much it spends on that mission but they typically dont know the most important element how well the charity does what it sets out to do sally beattys fascinating cover story lays bare that gap between what donors do know and what they should know she argues that the gap is unfair to donors to taxpayers and most significantly to those who depend on charities sally makes it clear how charities can close the gap but change also depends on those who generously open their wallets after all we demand to know all about the cars we buy shouldnt we hold charities to the same standard
