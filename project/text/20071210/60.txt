foundation matched employee donations of &# or more about &# was raised bloomingdales says in contrast private foundations typically require charities to submit formal aid request proposals according to guidelines that vary from group to group some foundations evaluate proposals only at certain times of the year or when their boards convene also private foundations mainly provide gifts in the form of financial donations it took about six months and a lot of hard work for waterpartners international a nonprofit based in kansas city mo to receive a &# grant from the michael and susan dell foundation in starting late that summer gary white the charitys executive director engaged in several lengthy discussions with the foundations officers about waterpartners strategy for helping impoverished individuals get clean water he then had to submit a seven page proposal according to the foundations specific guidelines on how the money would be used which he says took about a month to prepare including a trip overseas for research the grant was approved in december and waterpartners received a check soon after mr white says other grants issued by the michael and susan dell foundation can take as long as a year to process depending on their level of complexity says janet mountain an executive director at the private institution "evaluating grants takes time but for good reason " says ms mountain the purpose "is to focus our grant portfolio on areas where we believe we can have the most impact " corporate giving has risen an average of annually adjusted for inflation

private foundations last year charitable contributions by corporations totaled &# billion accounting for an estimated of total giving in the u s to both domestic and international causes giving usa says private foundations meanwhile gave &# billion or some of the total according to the report donations from individuals accounted for most of the rest but nancy lublin chief executive officer of do something a nonprofit group with a mission to encourage young people to improve the world says the competition for support from private foundations is fierce "the foundations have stacks of proposals " she says "theyre like the captain of the cheerleading squad she doesnt call anybody the guys call her " in contrast asking for corporate support typically involves less red tape pepsico inc s frito lay division gave free publicity to ms lublins group last summer featuring the photos of do something members along with captions about their work and the charitys web address on million bags of doritos ms lublin says that instead of having to complete a formal proposal form to win frito lays backing she made her case in a powerpoint presentation perfected in meetings phone calls and emails with jason mcdonell a frito lay marketing director after a sign off by a group vice president at the company the initiative was rolled out in less than three months ms lublin describes the exposure as priceless "it drove fabulous recognition for our organization and helped our web traffic " she says mr mcdonell says frito lay benefited because it was able to spread the word about its philanthropy without media coverage helping demonstrate the companys authentic interest in giving plus the initiative didnt cost a lot because the company regularly changes the design of its bags he says among other companies that have taken a more tactical approach to philanthropy in recent years is bank of america corp which has created a service on its internal web site to encourage employees to get involved and stay involved in volunteerism employees can search for volunteer opportunities in their city and sign up for them through the site the company gives workers two hours a week of paid time off for volunteering plus other incentives for example if an employee performs hours of volunteer service at a charity bank of america gives the group a &# grant on the workers behalf the web page was custom designed and allows bank of america to both recognize and measure employee volunteerism and share that information with shareholders and the public says andrew plepler president of the companys charitable arm while the company wouldnt disclose the cost of the initiative mr plepler says its employees contributed more than volunteer hours last year demonstrating altruism can be of great value to companies more than three quarters of roughly americans surveyed earlier this year said they wouldnt work for a firm they deemed socially irresponsible according to a report commissioned by cone inc a branding and research consulting firm in boston and conducted by opinion research corp whats more of the studys respondents said that price and quality being equal they would likely switch from one product to another if the other product was associated with a good cause aligning philanthropy with business goals was listed as the leading factor influencing corporative giving for of companies surveyed in by the conference board a nonprofit research group based in new york indeed charities and companies with the same target market usually make the best partners according to ms lublin "if what you care about is the same you can make beautiful music together " she says one potential downside to corporate charity is that sometimes it comes with strings attached ms lublin says a large corporation once offered &# to do something under the condition it be used to open offices in three u s cities because the nonprofit mainly operates online it rejected the offer "we will walk away from money if it doesnt make sense " she says ms needleman is a reporter for wsj com in new york she can be reached at sarah needleman wsj com
