philanthropy a special report giving and receiving with program related investing charitable foundations expect to get their money back and then some like small business loans they help fund projects such as affordable housing construction child care centers health clinics and other community redevelopment programs "what is important is that the intent of the investment is to further the mission " says shari berenbach executive director of the calvert foundation bethesda md which offers investment products that other charities can use to make pris such as low interest loans to recipients selected by the foundation charitable foundations typically give away money to fulfill their philanthropic missions but increasingly they expect their money back with interest its called program related investing or pri the idea is to make investments usually loans at below market rates or equity investments that further the foundations charitable goals pris can help foster a greater sense of responsibility among the beneficiaries and since the investments may provide a return boost a foundations impact as the money gets recycled into other projects pris are used for a wide variety of charitable purposes like small business loans they help fund projects such as affordable housing construction child care centers health clinics and other community redevelopment programs they can also be used say to help buy property for environmental or historic conservation foundations with an international scope often use pris to help make microfinance loans or tiny loans to poor entrepreneurs in developing countries most pris are low interest loans but they can also take other forms such as equity investments or loan guarantees investing in impoverished communities which traditionally dont have access to conventional sources of capital can help move them into the economic mainstream says debra schwartz director of program related investments at the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation in chicago the foundation has been doing pris for years and is committing some &# million this year to new investments primarily in affordable housing and economic development there are lots of financial benefits for using pris for one they help meet certain tax code rules the internal revenue service requires private foundations to distribute at least of their investment assets every year for charitable purposes normally the foundations make grants to meet this requirement but tax laws also count pris toward the payout other benefits include the ability to recycle returns on the loan or investment into other philanthropic projects pris are sometimes larger than grants too since the principal is likely to be returned there can be philosophical motives as well some foundations feel that making loans or expecting investment returns encourages a greater degree of accountability than simply making a grant in order to qualify as a pri under irs guidelines the investments chief purpose must be charitable rather than a hefty return thats why most pris feature below market rates or have generous terms nor can pris be used to influence legislation or advance a political campaign "what is important is that the intent of the investment is to further the mission " says shari berenbach executive director of the calvert foundation bethesda md which offers investment products that other charities can use to make pris such as low interest loans to recipients selected by the foundation "if the mission is to alleviate poverty you have to see how the investment is oriented to alleviating poverty " ms berenbach says for the recipients meanwhile there are benefits apart from the capital received including the opportunity to demonstrate their creditworthiness and fiscal responsibility a loan from a foundation can serve as a key steppingstone to obtaining more traditional forms of capital such as bank loans or for profit investors "its a magnet to attract others " says mary anne rodgers counsel for the david and lucile packard foundation based in los altos calif but pris arent appropriate for every organization or project it helps if the investment produces an income stream or acquires rights to assets that are expected to appreciate or can be liquidated rental real estate investments for example are attractive because rent provides a steady income flow foundations also say they only invest in or lend to recipients that can handle the responsibility many foundations only make pris in nonprofits or projects that have received grants in the past and have strong performance records although pris can be risky foundations say loan defaults or equity investments gone bust are rare indeed some of foundations that have made loans in the past years have had default rates of zero according to a new study by fsg social impact advisors a nonprofit consulting firm based in boston that examined investing programs at u s foundations of all sizes pris arent new but theyre growing more popular the ford foundation which pioneered pris has been doing them since the late s and the investments have been sanctioned in the federal tax code since these days the &# billion ford foundation has about &# million earmarked for pri investments one example a year &# million investment in shorebank enterprise detroit which provides loans and technical assistance to small and minority owned businesses in that city statistics on the scope of program related investments are tough to come by partly because pris are often mixed together with what are known as "mission related investments " thats when foundations invest a portion of their assets in projects that have two goals or a "double bottom line" furthering their charitable purposes and making money many mission related investments seek market rates of return by contrast the chief aim of a pri is to meet the foundations charitable purpose rather than to make lots of money the fsg study found that mission related investing and pris have grown substantially in recent years with the "vast majority" of the activity concentrated in pris new money committed to mission and program related projects grew at a compound annual rate of more than over the past five years compared with less than during the preceding years the study found the packard foundation exemplifies the growth in it made its initial pri investment with just &# by the foundation had nearly &# million in program related investments as of last august that number had grown to &# million its not just big foundations that are making these investments a growing number of small and midsize foundations are turning to pris michael rauenhorst for instance a trustee of his familys &# million foundation makes pris in microfinance projects in haiti jamaica and bolivia currently about &# of the foundations assets are in pris the investments fit with the foundations philosophy of "helping people to help themselves " says mr rauenhorst a new york banker with grants he adds it can be hard to know exactly how the money is eventually used pris however tend to be tracked over a period of years to ensure the money is returned "theres ultimately more accountability with a pri " he says many smaller foundations choose to invest through intermediaries providing capital to community banks for example which then make loans to end recipients the calvert foundation is one such intermediary it offers "community investment notes " which require a minimum &# investment and currently offer returns of up to the notes can be earmarked to invest in a variety of community development projects in the u s and overseas "theyre an easy pri in a box " says the foundations ms berenbach for those interested in making pris a good place to start is the web site of the nonprofit pri makers network www primakers net which provides lots of information about the investments and networking opportunities among foundations that make pris before making any investments however be sure to consult a lawyer and tax adviser to ensure the commitments stay within irs guidelines ms silverman is a
