democrats push &# billion spending bill the estimated &# billion measure reflects &# billion in cuts from earlier house passed spending bills even as new emergency funds are added for the state department and to ease a budget strain on the army given the continued impasse over funding for the iraq war washington after weeks of negotiations the house takes up tomorrow a single government wide spending bill that represents democrats last best shot at avoiding a repeat of the budget collapse last year under republican rule the estimated &# billion measure reflects &# billion in cuts from earlier house passed spending bills even as new emergency funds are added for the state department and to ease a budget strain on the army given the continued impasse over funding for the iraq war the pentagon would get an additional &# billion for the war in afghanistan and for the purchase of "force protection" equipment such as body armor for all troops in the field behind the numbers is a concerted effort to add as much as &# billion to army operations accounts thereby assuring adequate funding into april when a fuller debate can be held on the future u s role in iraq the package seeks to create a centrist coalition with moderate republicans but the politics of iraq make these treacherous waters for democrats provoking splits in their own party that ultimately empower the presidents conservative allies at the insistence of the bush administration the senate is all but certain to add more money for iraq when it takes up the bill angering house liberals the resulting splits among democrats will put senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky in the catbird seat house minority leader john boehner r ohio will also have a major say over spending because republican votes will be needed when the bill comes back from the senate for a second vote in the house as a result the house bill to be unveiled today is less a finished product than a vehicle for negotiations but its emergence marks the beginning of a final push before the holiday recess before the recess congress hopes to enact a landmark agreement to raise auto fuel economy standards and treasury secretary henry paulson is pressing for legislation to help address the home mortgage crisis but a child health insurance initiative is expected to fall narrowly short for lack of republican support to override mr bushs veto at some risk house speaker nancy pelosi d calif has ventured into medicaid changes well beyond what many democrats are comfortable with in an effort to turn the tide "one more step and our members wont be with me " she said but even with recent gains she is about eight votes short and will likely have to turn to a more incremental bill on the &# billion omnibus spending bill the white house was quick to threaten a veto even before reading it yet in an apparent effort to keep channels open mr bushs chief of staff josh bolten called senate majority leader harry reid d nev on saturday to warn him of the forthcoming statement by budget director jim nussle mr nussle argued that the proposed bill is &# billion over the presidents budget and accused democrats of trying to "leverage troop funding for more pork barrel spending " the &# billion estimate reflects &# billion added to the bill in emergency funds outside the budget of that &# billion &# billion is money directly requested by the state department and an additional &# billion is for a republican backed border security initiative for which the department of homeland security has already come to congress with plans on how to allocate the funds mr reid said the administration not democrats is using iraq to gain leverage and many democrats argue that the party would be stronger now if it hadnt stumbled into a situation where iraq funding is again attached to the domestic budget looking back democrats might have sidestepped this crunch if they had dealt with iraq more directly when approving a &# billion budget for the pentagon for the current year instead the decision was made that enough money was in the core defense budget that any decision over new war funding could be delayed until spring when iraq commander gen david petraeus is to brief congress again critics say it was never realistic to expect that the president would accept the delay and that the tactic exposed the democratic party to attacks for short funding army operations the omnibus bill seeks to address this complaint but mr bush is in a position to insist that unless direct funding is provided for the war he will veto the domestic spending "what theyre trying to do is hold the whole government hostage to this crazy money for iraq " said mr reid "all were trying to do is to swallow hard and give him enough for the military and keep the government open "
