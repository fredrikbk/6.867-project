philanthropy a special report english lessons a surge of new wealth in britain is changing the face of charitable giving many are demanding detailed business plans from charities are tying future donations to reaching specific targets and are offering their own professional skills to help charities grow "in the past some members of a particular family usually had a relationship with a charity and wrote an annual check " says megan pacey director of policy for the institute of fundraising a london based association of fund raising executives traditionally charitable giving in the u k has often followed the "spray and pray" principle write checks to a clutch of the best known charities and hope for the best but a new generation of self made millionaires is changing all that and breaking from the clubby world of british philanthropy these donors are importing u s style tactics to giving money and applying businesslike methods to ensure their money is well spent many are demanding detailed business plans from charities are tying future donations to reaching specific targets and are offering their own professional skills to help charities grow some are even hiring companies to help them decide how to best give away that money just a few years ago many big donors in the u k came from wealth inherited over the course of generations they tended to give money quietly and were often loath to press the charities about how that money was being spent "in the past some members of a particular family usually had a relationship with a charity and wrote an annual check " says megan pacey director of policy for the institute of fundraising a london based association of fund raising executives "it was pretty much guaranteed " the surge of new wealth in britain is the result of a younger group of hedge fund managers private equity investors and new entrepreneurs raking in tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars last year individuals in britain had more than &# million to invest excluding their first homes up from the year before according to a survey by merrill lynch &amp co and consulting firm capgemini the u k is now home to of europes rich the survey says and that rising wealth is driving up charitable giving according to charities aid foundation individuals in england gave a total of gbp billion &# billion last year up from and the richest are writing bigger checks the top donors in the u k have pledged a total of gbp billion this year up from gbp million in according to a list of the biggest u k donors compiled by the sunday times newspaper "every charity is saying theres new money and we all want it " says mark rowland head of major gifts for the christian aid charity in the u k chris hohn and his wife jamie cooper hohn no on the sunday times list are examples of the new philanthropists as a young banker working in the philippines the british born mr hohn was struck by the sight of children rummaging through trash heaps for food on his second date with ms cooper hohn an american he showed her photos of such kids so in he create the childrens investment fund a london based hedge fund that made headlines this year by pressing for strategic changes at some large european companies notably abn amro holding nv mr hohn turns over a percentage of the management fees and profits he earns from the fund to the childrens investment fund foundation or ciff which then distributes the money to charities the foundation which has committed to give away &# million since is managed by ms cooper hohn her team which includes a former consultant and former derivatives trader uses a private equity approach to giving for instance ciff often forces a charity to rewrite its business plan three or four times to ensure the donation will help the charity reach a new stage of growth "we drive our grantees up the wall with the number of redrafts " says ms cooper hohn "but for us this is not about investing in activities and crossing our fingers hoping it will work its about backing a plan we are convinced will change the world for kids " in looking for charities with the biggest impact on childrens lives ciff sometimes snubs traditional approaches for example ciff research concluded that microfinance didnt necessarily help families keep children in school or directly improve their well being instead ms cooper hohns team is considering investing in building toilets since finding out that they can dramatically cut the incidence of diarrhea a big killer of children in developing nations once ciff chooses a charity ms cooper hohn then assigns a portfolio manager who tracks its progress to make sure its hitting targets of course not all donors have their own foundations so some younger philanthropists are turning to a crop of companies that help people get more bang for their charitable buck one such group is new philanthropy capital which was founded in by three former goldman sachs partners npc takes an approach similar to equity research by first conducting an analysis of a given area such as domestic violence and then visiting between and charities working in that field to choose the best their analysts write up two page reports that resemble investment brokers notes giving a snapshot of the risk level of the charitys work its growth prospects and the funding it needs to achieve certain results npc posts the research on its web site for users to download at no charge npc also provides a service to donors who want to give a large amount but dont have the time or expertise to research the right charities if a donor is interested in a given area npc analysts choose a group of charities interview their management and recommend a clutch of them that could make up a diversified portfolio npc then follows up with reports about how well the charity has spent the money on average npc advises on about &lt pound&gt million &# million of contributions a month it charges to of the donation amount james blackburn head of equities for stockbroker execution ltd has turned to npc to help the firm give away money it raises during its annual charity trading day when it pledges to donate gross proceeds earned that day the idea has been a success raising a total of gbp million &# million since but early on mr blackburn and his colleagues who wanted to give money to smaller community charities realized they didnt have time to search out the right organizations with npcs help execution has funded community groups including one that runs training courses for young people just out of jail and one that helps poor women in belfast npc has calculated that executions donations have helped people "it would have been easy to give a million pounds to oxfam " a large international charity says mr blackburn "but we are an entrepreneurial company and we wanted to put an entrepreneurial stamp on our giving as well however everyone here has day jobs npc said well do the grunt work for you " another online source of research on charities is guidestar org the williamsburg va group which is owned by philanthropic research inc has offered a comprehensive database of information about u s charities for years and in late it started a similar service in the u k the free database contains the reports of all registered charities in britain and allows donors to compare charities using criteria like financial performance geography and age guidestar says it has unique weekly visitors to its u k site guidestar org uk compared with in the u s as donors become more financially savvy about giving some u k charities are raising their own game in the wake of negative media reports in the late s about charities wasting money about groups have signed on to a new charter dubbed impact members of impact promise to publish more information about how theyre spending donors money and provide quantifiable measures of the results of their activities they also promise to turn over their boards regularly and to ensure that directors bring expertise rather than simply a high profile name as was often the case one large charity that has changed its ways to attract the new breed of donors is christian aid it has a new staffer to deal with accountability and the charity subjects big projects such as its response to the tsunami to more frequent outside evaluation it also has hired a person to deal with private banks families own money management offices and the firms that help donors give their money away christian aids mr rowland says in the past donors mostly asked charities to fill out forms and submit an annual report before deciding whether to give and rarely followed up to ask how the money was spent but new philanthropists are more demanding he says earlier this year for instance an entrepreneur who had sold his business and was giving away gbp million &# million held a contest to choose some charities each had to submit a four page initial proposal the donor asked eight charities including christian aid to give him a presentation where he grilled top management about operations and the results of their activities he then narrowed it down to four before choosing to give part of the money to christian aid to help fund a project to support hiv sufferers in ethiopia "they expect the same standards that they might from a commercial organization " says mr rowland "and why not " ms ball is a staff reporter in the wall street journals london bureau she can be reached at deborah ball wsj com corrections &amp
