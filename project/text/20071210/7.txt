aker president aker opposed the law because "we think shareholders should make these decisions not the government " says bengt a rem chief financial officer after the law passed however mr rem says "we made the best of it " akers task was particularly complicated because in addition to its own all male board it eventually had to find women for six publicly traded businesses in its portfolio aker created a shareholder selected nomination committee separate from its board that included mr heiberg he began seeking a woman for the board of a portfolio company even before the law passed mr heiberg

equality on the board " he says mr heiberg believes the addition of so many female directors has improved akers corporate governance ms widvey for example has "good contacts in politics business and industry " he says men now do more homework before board meetings because they want to impress their female colleagues he adds "this is human nature " norways way tips from norwegian executives
