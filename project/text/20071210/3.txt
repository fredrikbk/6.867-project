americas showdown at fort tiuna while his piece relies on unnamed military sources inside the fort its account of the presidents behavior is consistent with other reports and with the failure of the cne to announce the results in a timely fashion as it promised there is only one thing more amazing than hugo chavezs defeat last week in a referendum designed to give him dictatorial powers that is the suggestion now being peddled by some members of the foreign press that by accepting the loss the venezuelan president has proven his democratic bona fides this is a preposterous claim and no one is doing a better job of disproving it than mr chavez himself in the week since the vote he has done nothing to conceal his appetite for vengeance and his determination to satisfy it he has twice crudely referred to the opposition victory as excrement and he has even insulted his followers who he says were "lazy and cowardly" for not turning out in greater numbers at the polls as to the democratic ideal of accepting the will of the people he will have none of it rather he is pledging to find another way to push through the constitutional amendments that voters rejected after nine years of chavez rule venezuelans know their president all too well and there was plenty of hand wringing this past week about the potential for a chavez crackdown in the wake of the referendum indeed only a wishful thinker could have bought into the presidents conciliatory act in the early morning hours of monday when he calmly congratulated the "no" campaign feigning acquiescence in the face of defeat is classic chavez and dates back to at least when he led a coup detat and failed at that time he used the same phrase "for now" as he did last week when speaking before a national television audience about his defeat in both cases his message was the same he had lost a battle but not his insatiable thirst for power this gives venezuelans reason to be fearful but the events that transpired behind the scenes on the night of the referendum have leaked into the public arena and now there are grounds for hope too as it turns out mr chavez is neither as popular nor as powerful as his friends in the foreign press have made him out to be venezuelas national electoral council cne was supposed to issue a preliminary report about two or three hours after the polls closed at p m a week ago sunday by p m there was still no news and the public was growing agitated around a m caracas time i inquired from new york about the delay one source close to the tallying process told me that mr chavezs "si" campaign had lost but that he was refusing to concede interestingly enough according to caracas based sources he was arguing with the military at its headquarters at nearby fort tiuna finally just before a m the cne announced that the "no" vote had won venezuelans of course wanted to know why the announcement had taken so long and apparently there were those in the military who wanted to tell on tuesday hernan lugo galicia a writer for the venezuelan daily el nacional published a chronicle of the long night and while his piece relies on unnamed military sources inside the fort its account of the presidents behavior is consistent with other reports and with the failure of the cne to announce the results in a timely fashion as it promised mr chavez denies that the military pressured him into accepting defeat but he has not denied that he went to fort tiuna and met with the high military command mr lugo galicia reports that the president told the officers that until of the votes were counted he would not recognize his defeat "tension is growing " mr lugo galicia writes of that moment the fort "is ordered closed and soldiers confined to their barracks a general stands up and after expressing respect for the commander in chief warns that the armed forces will not go out to repress the population " if tallying the votes were to take four days the general warns there would be mayhem and "this country will not bear such days of agitation " mr chavez seems to have been surprised by the vote mr lugo galicia reports that he was "irate " and launched recriminations against his closest confidants saying "they lied to me they deceived me " yet there was not much he could do to reverse the results as was expected retired gen raul baduel who had publicly called the governments effort to pass the amendments a "coup against democracy" seems to have played an influential role in persuading the president to accept his defeat according to mr lugo galicia military officials close to gen baduel tried to make mr chavez understand that it was useless "to prolong the agony " the chronicle continues the president "only listens and says nothing finally he gets up and withdraws to his private office within the military installation he remains there a long time no one knew what would happen " what happened it seems was that mr chavez was thwarted by the university students in a recall referendum against the president the paper ballots were never audited against voting machine totals this time the students joined the opposition fanned out across the country to witness the vote and promised that they would demand a full auditing of the paper ballots if there was suspected hanky panky this together with mr chavezs drop in popularity made it difficult to rig the final outcome in the end while mr chavez did not ignore the vote it wasnt because he didnt want to rather he calculated that giving in when all the evidence was against him was safer than facing an almost sure uprising from the population which the military had already said it would not put down mr chavez may have had some help in reaching that decision from his aging mentor fidel castro the miami herald reported on friday that when he went to his office at the military headquarters he phoned the cuban dictator for advice if so it would be routine chavez behavior in when he was briefly removed from power he was also coached by telephone from havana after that he briefly expressed contrition for his bullying ways and then resumed them there is a pattern of behavior here and its not that of democrat
