politics &amp economics populism to reign in argentina new leaders early moves suggest economic intervention will persist ten days ago mrs kirchner not her husband presided over a meeting at the presidential palace with supermarket executives to announce price ceilings on many products for the holidays business executives had maintained a flicker of hope that mrs kirchner a senator and political force in her own right might soften some of her husbands interventionist economic policies which include price control agreements subsidies and export restrictions buenos aires cristina kirchner didnt wait for her inauguration today to start advancing the populist economic policies that have been the hallmark of her husband nestor from whom she is assuming the reins ten days ago mrs kirchner not her husband presided over a meeting at the presidential palace with supermarket executives to announce price ceilings on many products for the holidays some constitutional purists grumbled that mrs kirchner was jumping the gun but supporters of the kirchners say they were just trying to ensure that argentinas experiment in his and hers presidencies proceeds smoothly business executives had maintained a flicker of hope that mrs kirchner a senator and political force in her own right might soften some of her husbands interventionist economic policies which include price control agreements subsidies and export restrictions but mrs kirchners christmas price accords early personnel moves and other policy indicators suggest she will hew to her husbands line just days after mrs kirchners oct electoral victory the government bumped up export taxes on soybeans wheat and corn steps that are highly unpopular with argentinas agrarian sector also over the past few weeks mr kirchners administration has continued a purge of experienced technocrats from the national statistics agency where newcomers loyal to the kirchners have been accused by private economists of lowballing inflation figures mrs kirchners recently announced cabinet consists largely of holdovers from her husbands government in one notable sign of continuity mrs kirchner gave a privileged place at the supermarket meeting to one of the more controversial figures in her husbands government internal commerce secretary guillermo moreno argentinas business community dislikes mr moreno for imposing price control agreements and threatening companies with prosecution under a long forgotten antihoarding law now it seems likely he will continue to have a significant role in mrs kirchners government what remains an open question is how much clout the youthful new economy minister martin lousteau will have analysts are expecting mr kirchner to continue to have a big behind the scenes role in economic policy he has been argentinas de facto economic chief since he ousted then economy minister roberto lavagna two years ago the kirchners "are exploiting their comparative advantages " says carola sandy an economist at credit suisse group in new york "shes always been the person more interested in judicial reforms and social programs and thats going to be her focus it seems hes more in charge of the pragmatic side of government especially the economy " while venezuelas populist president hugo chavez lost a referendum about a week ago that would have allowed him to become "president for life " the kirchners are moving ahead with their own distinctive form of leftist dynasty building in july mr kirchner his popularity still high but ebbing a bit stepped aside at the end of his first term to allow his wife to run as the peronist party standard bearer argentine law allows presidents to run for a second term but the kirchners idea was to avoid the political atrophy that often afflicts latin presidents as they become lame ducks in their second terms the kirchners strategy leaves open the possibility that either one of them could run for president in the kirchners met as law students in the s and have formed a political partnership ever since their supporters say they have earned a long reign thanks to argentinas recent economic resurgence the economy has grown at an average annual rate of more than during the past five years the countrys best performance in a century but there also are looming problems that mr kirchner has been reluctant to address private economists say inflation is more than double the roughly annual rate reported by the statistics agency additionally there are risks of energy shortages because the governments artificially low utility rates have fostered consumption and discouraged investment and after defaulting on its foreign debt in and cozying up to mr chavez argentina is still considered something of a pariah by some foreign investors and certain wealthy nations the way mrs kirchner has succeeded her husband for a four year term will make it more difficult for her to take tough steps to deal with the problems she has inherited "she wont be able to blame the previous government and even less recognize that many of the economic and social statistics with which nestor kirchner ended his term arent real " political scientist rosendo fraga wrote recently analysts hope mrs kirchners ascension will mark a stylistic shift away from her husbands brusque and confrontational manner pablo venturino managing director at abn amro in new york says he is counting on "finesse" from mrs kirchner she got off to a promising start with what many regard as a magnanimous victory speech on election night but in her recent farewell address to the senate mrs kirchner took some shots at the judiciary and the media institutions with which her husband has crossed swords one area where mrs kirchner will have her work cut out for her is in bettering argentinas rocky relationship with washington the bush administration cooled considerably to mr kirchner as he drew closer to mr chavez one sign of argentinas less than lofty status is that washington will be represented at the inauguration by the little known labor secretary elaine chao
