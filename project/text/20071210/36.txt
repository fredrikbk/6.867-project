chinese investors thirst for share offerings including zijin mining china coal guangzhou r&amp f great wall motor china telecom china netcom and peoples insurance company of china the opportunity these mainland listings could boost the companies class h shares or shares of mainland registered companies that trade in hong kong typically issuing yuan denominated class a shares available mostly to mainland investors provides a sort of value target for the h shares a shares fetch premiums of about to their hong kong counterparts according to abn amro the premiums stem from chinas capital controls which trap a lot of stock investing liquidity within the shanghai and shenzhen markets a follow on mainland chinese listing also can boost h share performance simply by increasing the companys buzz in the run up to the shanghai or shenzhen debut and the timing as blockbuster companies prepare to make their a share splashes h share investors shouldnt necessarily expect the party to continue well into next year "the hong kong listed shares of companies that completed a share listings typically outperform the market in the period prior to the ipo date while post ipo performance is less consistent " jing ulrich j p morgans managing director for china equities wrote in a year end research note to investors just look at the eye popping gains that oil and gas company petrochina netted on its first day of trading in shanghai last month though petrochinas a shares shot up that day nov to send the companys market capitalization above the us&# trillion mark by one measure its hong kong listed h shares fell and were down in a matter of weeks before rebounding modestly in shanghai the stock is faring worse down friday to yuan us&# from its opening day close of yuan such stumbles out of the gate are teaching investors a lesson about companies a share listing plans watch the hong kong stock price before the shanghai debut "people have become smarter " says lan xue at citi investment research "listing in shanghai is not going to automatically mean strong h share performance " the run up to that shanghai listing though thats been no problem take petrochina its h shares rose in the three months before the mainland debut from hong kong dollars us&# to hk&# on the eve of the shanghai listing that far outstrips even the hang seng indexs growth spurt to a record level in that stretch the same overall arc can be seen in other companies many of whose h shares have shot up in anticipation of the domestic listing only to have those gains evaporate the h shares of china shenhua energy were up in the three month lead to the companys oct listing in shanghai peaking at hk&# before plunging in the next six weeks bottoming out at hk&# china life insurance which saw its h shares rise in the three month run up to a jan a share listing peaked at hk&# before tailing off to settle around hk&# three months later companies often seek follow on listings during a high growth phase when they are hungry for more capital to expand operations suggesting their good fortune good buzz and share price growth can continue but some just cant sustain their h share prices even after the fresh infusion of mainland chinese cash ms xue of citi says companies going to the equity market with no obvious need for new funds enjoy "little support" for their h share prices in the aftermath of the follow on listing "what weve found is that those companies who use the money productively see continued performance " ms xue says "otherwise what we see is that these companies underperform " so as more and more hong kong listed chinese companies line up to list up north and h shares continue to stumble in the wake of the shanghai listings investors need to ask why does this company want to list in shanghai and will the listing create more value many companies seeking a shanghai listing really do need fresh funds to fuel expansion david cui head of china equity research and strategy with merrill lynch in shanghai highlights oil and gas players as well as property developers who are under pressure to snap up increasingly scarce prime real estate "most companies need the financing and you cant get equity any cheaper elsewhere " mr cui says still part of the reason for a mainland follow on especially for the big state controlled companies may be political even though chinese securities regulators say they dont actively encourage companies to list domestically "the chinese government wants to build a strong market and these companies are under pressure to return home " mr cui says
