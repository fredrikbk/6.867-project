the other market crisis the subprime mess is grabbing all the headlines these days but allow us to focus on another problem for american financial markets their growing lack of global competitiveness in the past year that problem has only grown worse thats the judgment of the latest report of the committee on capital markets regulation which started a debate last year with its initial study on how and why american public stock markets are losing global market share last week the committee a volunteer group of academics investors and business leaders led by harvards hal scott published its first follow up report which highlights two troubling new trends first the delisting of foreign companies from u s markets leapt this year to so far up from in and a decade ago those represented of all listed foreign companies in part the jump is the result of an sec rule change that lowered the bar for delisting but dont take comfort in that "pent up demand" to delist is still demand companies that maintain their listings only because they cant escape the sec hardly signal confidence in u s markets a second trend is the increasing number of u s companies going public outside the u s between and a mere three american companies went public by listing only on a foreign exchange in the first three quarters of this year firms made the same choice thats of all u s initial public offerings in that period given the natural affinities to listing in ones home market this exodus is remarkable its also alarming to the extent it reflects more serious underlying problems and as the report notes regulatory burdens especially post sarbanes oxley and litigation costs are driving companies out of our publicly traded markets this matters because the strength of financial markets is an important source of national prosperity it gives american firms and others that list here access to the deepest and most liquid pools of capital anywhere it also lets average americans share in the ownership of the countrys great businesses to cite another example from the new report since four out of five foreign companies that chose to raise capital in the u s through an ipo did so outside publicly traded exchanges instead they used whats known as the far more restricted rule a offering ten years ago more than half of these "global ipos" that came to the u s for part of their offering listed on a public exchange but companies that go the rule a route can only sell their shares to "qualified" investors and thus those companies are not subject to sarbox the securities exchange act of or to strict liability in shareholder suits to put it another way of the foreign companies that do raise capital in the u s do so outside of the reach of most of the laws that are supposed to protect investors these companies must think the costs of complying with regulation and avoiding litigation are no longer worth the benefits of a ticker symbol on the new york stock exchange this isnt a partisan issue or at least it shouldnt be democrats ought to appreciate that hollowing out our publicly traded markets in favor of foreign markets or private markets open only to the rich does not serve the small investor yet after last years general alarm over these trends this story has disappeared from our politics and media perhaps this is because our politicians and media elites know that they have helped to promote the lawsuits and regulation that are doing such harm meanwhile the british chinese and arabs are only too happy to steal our financial business
