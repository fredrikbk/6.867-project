philanthropy a special report checking on charities a growing number of online resources provide a starting point for evaluating nonprofit groups before you give a prospective donor can see that the march of dimes foundation wanted to continue a &# million education awareness and research campaign on premature birth in and that it has more than employees for most people figuring out how to vet charities can be a chore many of them dont release detailed information about the impact of their projects and the data that is out there takes a lot of deciphering now heres the good news things are getting better youll still have to do homework to figure out which charity is best and the charities are still quiet on lots of crucial points but there are more sources of information than ever to help you make your decision over the past couple of years the nonprofit watchdogs that help donors have added more information to their sites and theyve increased the number of organizations they follow moreover information about thousands of charities including internal revenue service returns and governance details is now available free on the web and its in an easy to read format that even a layman can understand heres a guide to finding and interpreting charity information on the web watchdog sites your first stop when researching a charity should be a watchdog site these groups offer information about nonprofits and often rate their efforts remember though that these sites come with some important caveats many of them rely on information in charities irs returns called form s and that information can be quite old by the time the watchdogs get it charities file their returns as much as months after the end of the fiscal year and then it can take months for the irs to process the form and make it available meanwhile if the charities arent forthcoming on their irs return the watchdogs data and analysis will end up skewed with that in mind heres a look at some of the best information sources out there charitynavigator org provided by the nonprofit group charity navigator in mahwah n j rates more than u s based charities using information in their form s the site is free to people who register for an idea of how the rankings work consider the groups take on united way of america the charity which is based in alexandria va gets three stars out of four for "efficiency " in part because of its budget went to programs and it cost only two cents for the program to raise a dollar the organization also gets three stars of four for "capacity " or its ability to sustain itself over time the group had annualized revenue growth of from through and had enough working capital to operate for about eight months without any income if you want to look at the raw data guidestar org a product of philanthropic research inc in williamsburg va is the go to organization for copies of a charitys form it covers million groups and has about million form images many of which are available free to people who register the site makes money from a combination of donations and subscriber fees so not all of the content is free for instance a prospective donor can see that the march of dimes foundation wanted to continue a &# million education awareness and research campaign on premature birth in and that it has more than employees to get other details such as the charitys income and assets you need a subscription that will run either &# or &# a month depending on the depth of information you want and other factors give org operated by the bbb wise giving alliance in arlington va reports on whether the approximately charities it has evaluated meet the alliances "standards for charitable accountability " it doesnt do ratings or rankings the groups free reports provide information on who runs a charity and list its income expenses assets and sources of income the reports also describe the groups programs in some cases this includes a breakdown of how much the group spent on them to meet the alliances standards organizations have to do everything from spend at least of total expenses on programs to provide a clear privacy policy online charities that come up short will have a report on exactly where they failed the naacp for instance fails on three standards the site says its annual report doesnt include the recommended financial information it doesnt include financial information or a recent form on its web site and it doesnt have a privacy policy with the recommended information on its web site give org says it was unable to evaluate six other standards because its waiting on an information request to the naacp the naacp says many of the requested items like the annual report and privacy policy are on the site even if they lack the level of detail desired by the alliance it says the groups web disclosures are in line with its peers and that more specific information like a copy of the form can be obtained by contacting the naacp directly moreover an naacp spokesman points out that each watchdog site has its own criteria and agenda which can make it difficult for nonprofits to satisfy every set of standards he recommends checking multiple sources to get a more accurate picture of the organization figuring it out yourself so what if the charity youre interested in hasnt been reviewed by a watchdog group first get some information at the irs site irs gov search for publication which has a list of nonprofit groups that qualify for tax deductible donations next up request a form the irs return required by most organizations with annual revenue of more than &# will have much of the financial information you need from there some general guidelines will be useful in evaluating that information lets start with how much the charity spends on its work charitynavigator org says seven of charities devote at least of their budget to programs and nine of devote at least a charity that spends of its money on programs isnt likely to have much longevity but a program that spends too little could be more interested in enriching staffers then helping the underprivileged but be careful when weighing ratios says charity navigator president trent stamp since the expected program expenses vary depending on the work thats being done food banks for instance devote a higher portion of expenses to programs say or so museums in contrast spend about of the budget on programs so if youre investigating a charity compare its numbers with those of another group thats closely related for instance you might compare the committee for missing children in lawrenceville ga with the national child safety council since the groups do similar work and have similar revenue you would find that the two have strikingly different spending ratios the committee for missing children spends of its budget on programs and on fund raising according to irs returns while the national child safety council spends on programs and on fund raising david thelen chief executive of the committee for missing children says the fund raising costs seem disproportionately high because the group has to rely on pricey telemarketing he says the group doesnt have the same cachet as larger organizations which has made it difficult to get corporate donations or gifts from individuals that arent solicited by a third party its also important to make sure the irs return accurately conveys the organizations behavior and isnt full of one time expenses a charity may have low program spending one year because its investing in a new computer system that is going to make the organization more productive down the road for instance in the case of the committee for missing children irs returns for the past three years show that program expenses were less than of the budget in and the national child safety council by contrast spent just of the budget on programs in but the number increased to in and in mr thelen at the committee for missing children says that while the program percentages may seem small it doesnt change the fact that the money is going to good use that or so distributes pictures of missing children provides literature on child recovery and connects parents with help here and abroad meanwhile the national child safety council says it understated program spending prior to due to a misunderstanding of irs rules if the charity seems to be having an off year call or email to find out why the nonprofit may have a great reason but if it answers with a fuzzy explanation or wont take the call it may be time to move on checking executive salaries which are listed on the form can also be helpful donors are sometimes dismayed by what they perceive as exorbitant wages but its important to take the numbers in context many nonprofits are complex multimillion dollar organizations that require experienced managers a labor pool that isnt cheap if a salary seems high check salaries at charities that are doing similar work and that are a similar size the alarm bells shouldnt start ringing unless executive compensation is out of line with comparable organizations donors who check the form may also want to look at the list of "officers directors trustees and key employees" toward the middle of the form an organization that has multiple family members on the payroll as directors or that pays the president a nominal amount but shells out hundreds of thousands of dollars to someone in a lower level position deserves some extra scrutiny its also a good idea to do a web search on the organization and its officers since the mainstream media along with bloggers and forum members often flush out problems before the irs pulls a charitys tax exempt status a short conversation with a staffer can also be helpful ask whether the organization has a written privacy policy thats available for review sometimes nonprofits will sell the names of donors who contribute nominal amounts say &# or &# also look into progress the organization made the previous year and check its goals for the year to come someone in the group should be able to answer those questions in a clear way sharing the work vetting a charity may seem daunting or too time consuming but people with charitable inclinations dont have to go it alone a number of donors are joining "giving circles " members generally pool money and divide the research among members of the group the idea has gained popularity in recent years with the forum of regional associations of grantmakers in washington identifying more than giving circles in up from about in the circle investigates charities as a group and then decides how to distribute the money in some circles decisions are made by consensus while others let majority rule or let individual members vote with their dollars margae diamond an executive at a donor advised fund in san francisco joined the traveling giving circle to kenya a project of the clarence foundation last year the group went to africa and visited six charities in six days the international child resource institute in nairobi kenya completed some of the background research but the members of the circle did plenty of reconnaissance on the ground they interviewed the program leaders and talked with many of the people receiving services they also investigated conditions at the charities which helped them spot larger needs or areas where the charity might have been looking for a quick fix ms diamond says the group made better decisions about giving because it was able to draw on the knowledge and input of so many people "it was very very thorough " ms diamond says "we never stopped talking about it " ms badal is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south brunswick n j
