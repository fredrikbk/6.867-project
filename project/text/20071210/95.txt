housing market downturn and how it shook the rickety architecture of investment vehicles balanced on risky mortgages have become "comparable to some of the biggest financial disasters of the past half century " the wall street journal says "so far the potential losses look manageable compared with the savings and loan crisis of the s and the tech stock crash of but the housing debacle could yet take years to work out thanks to the sheer complexity of it " and until a still murky situation becomes clearer "investors will remain jittery and banks will likely hold back on all kinds of lending a credit crunch that is already damping global growth and could tip the u s economy into recession " the journal adds on top of what state governments are doing washington is addressing the matter on several fronts these include the bush administrations orchestration of a plan to help struggling homeowners at the heart of the crisis by freezing interest rates that are set to rise and trigger more defaults and another aimed at bringing big banks together in a "superfund" to financially support the investment entities tottering under the weight of their bad mortgage backed securities but the most clear cut actor and action in the drama are the federal reserve and its expected move to lower interest rates at policy makers meeting tomorrow the markets often rise or fall on the slightest indication from economic data or fed officials words that the central bank will increase or decrease the cost of borrowed money but as businessweek notes a four year old study from the st louis fed demonstrated that the fed has a much easier time reining in economic growth than stimulating it "in the two years following a one percentage point increase in the federal funds rate quarterly gdp growth fell percentage points in the two years following a one percentage point cut in the funds rate quarterly growth rose percentage points " according to the magazines description of the study "the problem is the fed can make more money available in the financial system but it cant force lenders to lend it out or borrowers to borrow it " and there are growing doubts about corporate americas willingness to take on more debt corporate profits "are being hammered by the slowing economy and credit market turmoil intensifying concerns that the nation may be headed for recession " the journal reports noting that "businesses ranging from makers of artificial hips to surf wear retailers to overnight delivery services are feeling the pinch " in addition to the resonating financial pressure of the credit crunch businesses are struggling with greater uncertainty in the currency markets which can raise the costs of a manufacturing base increasingly overseas and high oil costs which hit

from other financial institutions the new york times says after already scaling back the size of the fund aimed at shoring up the credit markets by buying bad debt from so called structured investment vehicles some participants may already be looking elsewhere for help people briefed on the situation say citigroup is working a separate rescue plan while "hsbc and several other european banks are moving to solve their problems on their own " the times reports it turns out that "federal and state authorities may have missed an opportunity two years ago to get ahead of the mortgage securities pricing crisis " the journal also reports "in the securities and exchange commission and new york states attorney generals office launched separate investigations into whether" bear stearns improperly valued its mortgage backed securities in a way that hurt investors and an sec branch office was close to recommending charges the journal says the new york attorney generals office then under eliot spitzer was also looking into how the securities were priced but the cases were dropped two years before the firms disclosure of poorly priced debt sunk two of its internal hedge funds and helped spark the credit crunch there is a lot of blame to go around and neither president bush nor his democratic opponents in congress missed an opportunity this weekend to blame each others parties for not moving faster to help millions of americans and their economy as the hill reports the extent of the crisis isnt one the government alone can even define and will ultimately depend as the journal says "largely on how steeply the price of the average american home falls " brazilian fund may target currency rate brazilian finance minister guido mantega tells the financial times the countrys planned sovereign wealth fund will be aimed at intervening in foreign exchange markets to keep the brazilian currency from appreciating too much "it will have the function of reducing the offer of dollars in
