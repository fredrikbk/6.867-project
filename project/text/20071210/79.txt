race is on for the next blood thinner drugs are in advanced testing but safety questions remain unanswered interest in anticlotting treatments is being ratcheted up at a meeting of the american society of hematology under way in atlanta where johnson &amp johnson is presenting data showing that the experimental pill rivaroxaban is superior to lovenox an injectable treatment marketed by sanofi aventis sa in preventing clots in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery the flurry of interest reflects increasing understanding of what doctors call the coagulation cascade the system that causes clots to form to stop bleeding in the face of injury but can lead to heart attacks strokes and clots in the legs or lungs when triggered by disease processes big name pharmaceutical companies are hoping to find a new blockbuster drug in a market now dominated by one of the oldest mainstay pills in medicine the blood thinner warfarin at least five next generation blood thinners are in advanced testing to treat or prevent potentially debilitating or life threatening blood clots in surgery and heart patients first candidates could reach the market in questions about their effectiveness and safety remain unanswered however and a clear picture of the scope of the clinical and economic potential of the drugs isnt likely to emerge for at least two years if major hurdles are cleared some analysts believe the global market for the blood thinners could exceed &# billion by the middle of the next decade interest in anticlotting treatments is being ratcheted up at a meeting of the american society of hematology under way in atlanta where johnson &amp johnson is presenting data showing that the experimental pill rivaroxaban is superior to lovenox an injectable treatment marketed by sanofi aventis sa in preventing clots in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery johnson &amp johnson is co developing rivaroxaban with bayer ag of germany which discovered the compound other contenders in the market include bristol myers squibb co which is developing a pill called apixaban with pfizer inc eli lilly &amp co boehringer ingelheim gmbh of germany and closely held portola inc south san francisco calif all are testing their drugs initially in hip and knee replacement patients who often receive lovenox sanofi aventis says that lovenox is proven safe and effective for such patients and that safety of oral anticoagulant remedies remains unknown the big opportunity lies in treating atrial fibrillation a type of irregular heartbeat that afflicts an estimated million americans and million people world wide the condition is a major cause of stroke and patients need to be on daily therapy for the rest of their lives warfarin a half century old drug marketed as coumadin by bristol myers and in generic versions by other companies is the standard option but the choice of drug for this condition can be complicated for doctors and patients alike "atrial fibrillation is really everyones main target " says jack lawrence vice president of development in charge of apixaban at bristol myers several large late stage trials of the new drugs versus warfarin are under way with initial results expected in the flurry of interest reflects increasing understanding of what doctors call the coagulation cascade the system that causes clots to form to stop bleeding in the face of injury but can lead to heart attacks strokes and clots in the legs or lungs when triggered by disease processes four new blood thinners target an enzyme called factor xa one of several enzymes that play an important role in the cascade boehringer ingelheims drug dabigatran blocks thrombin another enzyme in clot formation a previous thrombin inhibitor called exanta developed by astrazeneca plc showed promise in preventing clots but it caused liver damage killing its prospects observers say new treatments will be watched closely for effects on the liver doctors have long wanted an alternative to warfarin the drug requires patients to have frequent blood test monitoring and it can produce serious side effects if it reacts adversely to other drugs a patient takes a common occurrence or even to a change in diet many patients have difficulty staying on the drug and estimates are that doctors prescribe it for fewer than of those who need it an effective drug for atrial fibrillation without warfarin like baggage "will be an instant blockbuster " said william oneill executive dean of clinical affairs at university of miamis miller school of medicine "people will switch on day one " johnson &amp johnson and bayer are hoping rivaroxaban can strike the right balance a study of patients who had hip replacement presented saturday at the hematology meeting showed that of those given rivaroxaban either died or had a nonfatal blood clot in the legs or lungs compared with of those given lovenox a reduction of two patient studies one on hip replacements and one on knee replacements scheduled to be presented today yielded similar findings "these are results that exceeded our expectations " says peter dibattiste vice president and head of cardiovascular medicine at johnson &amp johnson johnson &amp johnson plans to file data from the three studies plus another nearing completion to the food and drug administration by late next year bayer has already filed for approval in europe approval for hip and knee replacement could come in if all goes well more research is required to show whether the medicine is safe and effective in broader conditions and for treatment of conditions including atrial fibrillation and high risk heart patients which could be more lucrative johnson &amp johnson says it plans to enroll patients in studies to evaluate the drugs potential the new rivaroxaban data add "more credence to the mechanism but it doesnt tell us much for atrial fibrillation " says steven paul research and development chief at lilly whose factor xa program trails that of johnson &amp johnson and bayer "they and we need to do additional testing because the long term tolerance is critical the example of exanta is that people did great for a couple months but over time there was toxicity "
