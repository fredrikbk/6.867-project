dissecting the bailout plan if risky subprime borrowers were actually supposed to be the main beneficiaries of such refinancing assistance then it would have been the height of irresponsibility for president bush to suggest greater involvement of the federal housing administration fannie mae and freddie mac christopher cagan of first american real estate solutions using a huge sample and conservative assumptions estimates that "the impact of rate sensitivity and subsequent defaults will be well below one half percent of total mortgage debt outstanding " and spread over several years it is not quite right to describe the new white house plan as a bailout of subprime mortgage borrowers actually it is a bailout for a tiny fraction of those with adjustable rate mortgages arms not subprime loans per se nearly half of all subprime mortgage rates are fixed rate loans and only of arms are subprime with all the misplaced political anxiety about rates being reset you might imagine that all those victims who signed up for these mortgages had no idea their rates might actually be adjusted the bush administration claims the plan will help "up to" million people most of that promised help consists of nothing more than another phone number to call for counseling about refinancing a redundant service unlikely to prove wildly popular refinancing has been soaring anyway thanks to year mortgage rates dipping below if risky subprime borrowers were actually supposed to be the main beneficiaries of such refinancing assistance then it would have been the height of irresponsibility for president bush to suggest greater involvement of the federal housing administration fannie mae and freddie mac shifting default risk to u s taxpayers could be very costly in reality the only financial aid in this plan goes to those who qualify for the five year freeze on mortgage rates a curiously selective little group estimated to number between and when it comes to resetting mortgage payments below the level borrowers agreed to why give a special deal to sam but not suzie on the day the plan was unveiled the mortgage bankers association reported that of mortgages went into foreclosure in the third quarter and that were far behind in their payments neither group qualifies for any help under the bush plan neither does anyone with imperfect timing those who took out a mortgage before or after this july among the few lucky enough to slip through that narrow window the primary criterion for a rate freeze is a weak credit rating below and what happens after five years presidential contender sen hillary clinton is already talking about stretching it to seven years and that bidding war has just begun on the face of it these criteria for political favoritism seem only marginally more sensible than limiting special loan terms to say short people or redheads is it a bailout the stock market sure thought so stock prices of mortgage companies and homebuilders soared on the news after all the plan was designed by and for those same companies key members of the "hope now alliance " treasury secretary hank paulson describes the arbitrary rewriting of financial contracts as a win win situation for everyone if that were true the government would not have to get involved in a win win deal sen clinton would also not have felt compelled to threaten legislation to prohibit lawsuits from unhappy owners of mortgage backed securities if this "changing of the rules in the middle of the game " as many have described it becomes a precedent future funding will dry up quickly and permanently particularly for low income borrowers why buy a bond that can have its terms changed by political whim president bush says he only wants to bail out borrowers not lenders yet the whole point of this scheme is to cajole or bribe more borrowers into making more mortgage payments to lenders the plan supposedly excludes speculators because it applies only to owner occupied homes yet smart speculators know it is difficult to sell an empty or rented house popular books about getting rich by "flipping" homes recommend living in the house while youre fixing it up for resale in the interim temporarily low adjustable rates act like rent subsidies despite loose chatter about rates being reset to levels "as high as" or more arms are typically linked to interest rates that are now unusually low such as the rate on one year treasuries resets rarely exceed three percentage points even low rate teaser loans not often granted to subprime borrowers typically set a cap on how much the minimum payment can rise in a year christopher cagan of first american real estate solutions using a huge sample and conservative assumptions estimates that "the impact of rate sensitivity and subsequent defaults will be well below one half percent of total mortgage debt outstanding " and spread over several years "reset adjustments to subprime loans may not be as serious as one might think " he finds because such high rate borrowers face proportionately smaller increases in monthly payments and judging by the equity in their homes were apparently required to make significant down payments the greatest risk of people defaulting because of interest rate resets mr cagan finds is from those "making artificially low teaser payments" who now find themselves with no equity because local house prices fell teaser loans accounted for of all active first mortgages originated in and according to mr cagan although was too long ago to qualify the very idea of freezing rates as low as is bizarre the political excuse for getting the government involved in helping a few politically favored borrowers is based on false assumptions that subprime mortgages were usually used to buy a house that a huge percentage of subprime loans face foreclosure and that the main reason for foreclosure is rising interest rates all three conventional assumptions were undone by a new study from the boston fed its research shows that "most subprime loans are refinances of a previous mortgage " it estimates that "about of people who finance home purchases with subprime mortgages will eventually experience foreclosure" within a year period most importantly the boston fed economists found that most foreclosures do not result from adjustable rates going up but from local house prices going down they "attribute most of the dramatic rise in foreclosures in and in massachusetts to the decline in house prices that began in the summer of subprime lending played a role but that role was in creating a class of homeowners who were particularly sensitive to declining house price appreciation rather than as is commonly believed by placing people in inherently problematic mortgages " if you owe more money on a house than the house is worth foreclosure can be a perfectly rational choice suppose mr smith bought a house for &# with no money down but the value of that house has now fallen to &# if he refinances or sells the house he would still owe the mortgage servicer an extra &# falling home prices in many areas provide a powerful incentive to default on the loan live rent free for many months and then hand the keys to the bank those who bought homes with no money down have nothing to lose by walking away if they cant resell their homes at a profit perhaps that explains why only those with substandard credit ratings are singled out for special treatment under the bush administrations plan the "hope now" behind this plan is that people who have good reasons to default will keep paying anyway even if the value of their houses keeps falling some in the news industry have described all this heavy handed political intervention as the bush administrations "free market approach" to the threat of nonperforming mortgages on the contrary honoring contracts and property rights is absolutely essential to the proper functioning of a free society and free economy a mortgage is a binding contract between consenting adults a mortgage backed security is private property it is the antithesis of a free market for the government to fix prices pressure mortgage service companies into renegotiating contracts and thereby expropriate property rights of those stuck holding mortgage backed securities another president richard nixon gained ephemeral popularity by freezing wages and prices on aug but the end result was disastrous for the economy the bush administration may hope now for some political benefit from freezing interest rates for a select subgroup of high risk borrowers but whenever politicians attempt to protect borrowers and lenders from their folly they just encourage more folly mr reynolds a
