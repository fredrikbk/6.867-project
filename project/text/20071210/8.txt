big digger candidate rallies koreans behind a grandiose project lee pitches huge canal to kick start economy a waterway videogame lee myung bak built highways and power plants around the world as the youthful head of south koreas biggest construction firm bureaucrats in seoul decide what roads can be built on far off jeju island how many students can attend law school and how much the nations tv networks can charge for commercials seoul south korea the likely next president of south korea has promised to raise his country to the top echelon of world economies with the help of corporate tax cuts and other pro business policies but his most popular idea comes straight from the countrys past and his own build something really big lee myung bak built highways and power plants around the world as the youthful head of south koreas biggest construction firm as seouls mayor he uncovered a long buried stream and built a downtown park around it his new plan if he is elected next week would be his grandest yet a &# billion canal project that would connect two rivers by tunneling miles through a mountain to form a new shipping route bisecting the country from northwest to southeast rivals and most economists here say the country has too many other needs to spend so much on a freight route to ease traffic and that the country needs to move beyond showy government led undertakings but the sheer audacity of the idea appeals to many south koreans as it echoes the centrally planned projects of the s and s that first kindled the countrys growth south koreas dilemma illustrates the difficulty that even fast growing developing countries can face in trying to make the transition to a fully developed economy the country surged for years to become the worlds th largest economy and a top exporter of steel autos ships and electronics but its once torrid growth rate has dipped and brazil and india slipped past it last year lowering south koreas rank to th that has helped put this competitive nation on edge south koreans are watching neighboring chinas living standards begin to rise closer to theirs but havent yet attained the middle class comforts of nearby japan mr lee says the canal would generate hundreds of thousands of jobs and boost real estate values in less affluent inland regions that have stagnated while cities on the coasts have zoomed he leads opinion polls for the dec election with support of more than of likely voters more than double his nearest opponent in south korea the top vote getter wins outright most economists say what south korea most needs to do to complete its transition is diversify south koreas service economy lags behind its retail sector is dominated by small shops and it has produced no world class banks or investment houses meanwhile central planning persists bureaucrats in seoul decide what roads can be built on far off jeju island how many students can attend law school and how much the nations tv networks can charge for commercials while the government no longer tells businesses where they should invest earlier this year it told rivals samsung electronics co and lg philips lcd co to work with each other so south korea wouldnt lose its lead in the production of lcd panels "at some point government led economic growth must be changed into market led economic growth " says na seong lin professor of economics at hanyang university in seoul the country also is running into a raft of advanced economy problems labor costs are rising reducing south koreas lure for foreign manufacturers and leading its own companies to build elsewhere lifetime employment is no longer guaranteed by the conglomerates that dominate the business landscape real estate prices have soared out of control while a rash of forced early retirements have helped spur nervous workers to try to save as much as of their income as advised in a best selling book hong suk geun a year old construction company manager in suburban seoul is worried about the future especially about companies increasingly forcing middle aged workers to retire early so mr hong the father of a two year old daughter has been saving and investing or about &# of his &# yearly salary that is more than twice the national savings rate which already is far higher here than in the u s and other developed countries he moved to an apartment next to his office walks to most places and says he saves on food costs by eating at home he goes out for drinks only if someone else pays mr hong says he hopes mr lee will put life back into the nation "he is the one who understands the economy and industry " he says many south koreans complain the current president roh moo hyun has let the economy drift mr roh barred by the constitution from running for a second five year term campaigned in on promoting social equality and reducing the influence of big business but mr roh was caught off guard when property speculation took off his initial move changing building codes to discourage big developments only drove prices higher raising the capital gains tax eventually slowed the price increases mr roh embraced a free trade agreement with the u s but it faces opposition in both countries south korean industries such as farming fear foreign competition and free trade also symbolizes an economy left more to its own devices something that makes many koreans nervous economic growth over the past five years still appears robust by western standards at about a year but it pales in comparison to the to of the previous five years and the even higher numbers of previous decades mr lee is pitching south koreans a " economy " the slogan means raising annual growth back to doubling per capita income to &# within a decade and raising south koreas rank among the world economies to seventh which today would require doubling its size to overtake italy and trail france mr lees plan also called "economy first " includes orthodox pro business strategies including lowering corporate taxes currently the fourth highest among the industrialized countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development he says he will pursue deregulation and that the governments involvement in the economy should be limited to "a level that helps the market to do its role " but he spends the most time talking about the canal his campaign web site features a videogame in which the player navigates a boat up the potential waterway passing cities and towns along the way big projects like the canal dont contradict his advocacy of limited government he says because private companies cant initiate them "the canal will greatly contribute to the economic growth of korea " he says in an interview "it will make a lot of jobs and balance development among regions " mr lee was born into poverty in a small town his parents couldnt afford to send him to regular secondary school he sold food on the streets during the day and went to classes at night when tuition was free to students who kept good grades merchants who knew his family helped pay mr lees entrance fee to the prestigious korea university he repaid them by collecting garbage from their shops his arrest at an antigovernment protest during college threatened to ruin his career south korea was under the authoritarian rule of military strongman park chung hee potential employers fearful of upsetting the regime rejected mr lee upon learning of the arrest so mr lee audaciously wrote a letter to mr park to complain a young man has to make his own living he said adding "but if a nation blocks him from doing so the nation owes him forever " some of mr parks staff then met mr lee and cleared the way for hyundai construction then a small firm of people to hire him "anyone can face a critical moment and be in a miserable situation " mr lee said in the interview about that time in his life "the important thing is a strong will to never get frustrated nor surrender " once inside mr lee continued to speak boldly telling company leaders about problems that managers above him wouldnt that candor helped him rise quickly even though south korean firms normally maintain a strict adherence to seniority by age in at age he became south koreas youngest company president hyundai construction then part of a giant conglomerate with hyundai motors expanded under his leadership to become the countrys largest construction firm in the s though it has been passed by rivals since then mr lees unusual story became a prime time tv drama in called "time of ambition " the saga it documents still is cited as a big draw by supporters "he started as a beginner at a company and became the head step by step " says kim sung mee a year old teacher in seoul "i believe he understands the life of ordinary people " in mr lee left hyundai and entered politics saying at the time he felt he could have a broader impact on koreas economy he was first elected to the national assembly as seouls mayor in he started work on the idea that sealed his reputation a few years earlier he had spent a year in the u s as a visiting researcher at george washington university he visited boston to see the big dig a mammoth downtown project to reroute a central highway and build a bridge and tunnel though it suffered major delays and cost overruns before its completion last year mr lee left impressed by the projects ambition mr lee in tore down an elevated highway in the middle of seoul to uncover the stream buried beneath it to create part of a four mile ribbon of park the &# million project including decorative bridges draws tens of thousands of visitors a day and private investors are building new offices and restaurants alongside it for his new canal digging project mr lee was inspired by a tv documentary that recounted a s proposal for moving coal on rivers south korea had no highways then government officials and civil engineers played around for decades with the idea of developing a commercial waterway but the expense was always considered too great for the developing country mr lee contacted one of those engineers cho won cheol who told him that the idea was to deepen and connect two of koreas biggest rivers the han and nakdong which are separated by a mountain range after studying several ways around the engineers had settled on tunneling through a mountain a second tunnel would carry water from a mountain lake to fill the main canal which would flow at a higher elevation than the two rivers one river barge carries as much freight as container carrying trucks so the canal would help relieve traffic pressure across the country says mr cho now a professor at yonsei university in seoul "the total cargo demand for the country will double by " he says "we dont have enough space on the roads for that " he says the tunnel could also feature cruises for tourists chung dong yong the candidate of the successor to mr rohs political party and mr lees strongest opponent says the canal is too expensive and will harm the environment neither side has done a technical study though mr rohs construction ministry earlier this year issued a report criticizing it other politicians say mr lee is sure to scale it back if he is elected by simply dredging the two rivers to encourage freight traffic without digging the more dramatic connection through the mountain mr lee says he will try to lure private investors to pay for the project though he has declined to name any takers he recalls naysayers in the s who said south korea wasnt ready to build its first highway "that highway shortened the time of industrialization by to years " he says some of mr lees most enthusiastic support comes from people living near the canals potential routes who hope local businesses will get a boost from the construction work and future traffic mungyeong a small city of is located where the waterway would turn away from the nakdong river and through the mountain range the local economy is mainly agricultural and has grown more slowly than the national average park seong tae a manager at a employee construction company there says the firm could benefit from side projects such as new roads and buildings along the river the local construction industry "is nearly dead now " he says "i hope we can win some contracts" from the canal mungyeong residents who own land near the city have high hopes for a wealth boost from tourists a forum at the local town hall in june has already generated excitement jeon gang moon a real estate broker and farmer hadnt been interested in the canal until he attended but he learned that it could bring tourists shipping crews and freight workers creating demand for lodging and other services that in turn would boost land prices and "money will circulate and the quality of life here will increase " he hopes "i think the project will really develop this city " he says "i decided to vote for lee myung bak only because of this canal project " sungha park contributed to this article
