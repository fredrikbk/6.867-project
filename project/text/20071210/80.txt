small brews show theyre not weak beer as popularity rises specialty brewers challenge distributors last week mr bell quietly re entered the illinois market with a new brand even though he expects to be sued by his former distributor national wine &amp spirits inc mr bell found two distributors central beverage co and schamberger brothers inc in the chicago area willing to take on his new kalamazoo royal amber ale despite the possibility theyll be sued too last year mr bell was dismayed when national wine &amp spirits an indianapolis company insisted on selling distribution rights to chicago beverage systems a unit of reyes holdings llc one of the nations largest beer distributors last fall larry bell yanked the beers made by his small michigan brewery out of chicago where they enjoyed a loyal following rather than see the rights to market them there sold to another distributor he worried that his specialty beers would get lost among the distributors mass market brands "i didnt feel that they were the right fit for us " says mr bell who founded his brewery now based in comstock mich in last week mr bell quietly re entered the illinois market with a new brand even though he expects to be sued by his former distributor national wine &amp spirits inc mr bell found two distributors central beverage co and schamberger brothers inc in the chicago area willing to take on his new kalamazoo royal amber ale despite the possibility theyll be sued too the maneuver is perhaps the most audacious in a string of recent efforts by small batch "craft" brewers in the u s to try to assert more control over how their beer is sold as they gain in popularity and clout the craft brewers are using this new influence to stir up changes with beer distributors other brawls have erupted in new york and texas the fights stem from the nations complex regulations for selling alcohol under laws that date to the repeal of prohibition in beer generally must be sold through distributors producers like bells brewery sell the brew to a distributor which marks up the price and trucks it to a bar restaurant or store which then sells it to a consumer the system was designed to keep alcohol producers from running bars and restricting consumer choice states were given authority to regulate alcohol sales within their borders many including illinois have enacted so called franchise laws designed to protect beer distributors from being dropped arbitrarily by a brewer after they have spent considerable resources building a brand the laws prevent a brewer from terminating a distributor except under certain circumstances such as fraudulent business dealings distributors on the other hand generally have the power to sell distribution rights whether the brewer likes it or not historically craft brewers have made relatively little fuss over distributors in part because they have been happy to have companies willing to hawk their brands but now at a time when craft beer has become the industrys fastest growing segment some small brewers are taking greater control over their destinies they are attempting to dump their distributors or fighting moves to sell distribution rights often over allegedly poor service craft brewers seem "to be feeling their oats a bit " says benj steinman editor of beer marketers insights an industry publication last year mr bell was dismayed when national wine &amp spirits an indianapolis company insisted on selling distribution rights to chicago beverage systems a unit of reyes holdings llc one of the nations largest beer distributors he worried the company which sells mass market brands including miller lite would devote little attention to his beers in an emailed statement james doney president of chicago beverage systems said "we were looking forward to adding bells to our portfolio of fantastic craft beers" and "were puzzled by larry bells choice to leave the market " though illinois accounted for of his sales mr bell left the state and entered new markets such as virginia and florida but he decided to return to the chicago market after his email inbox was flooded with illinois residents thirsting for bells says mr bell years old a native of the chicago area who maintains a home in the city "i was really bummed " says year old chicagoan sean ludera a devotee of such brands as bells two hearted ale and bells oberon ale mr bell has taken a measured approach for legal reasons creating the new brand which partly pays homage to the brewerys first home in kalamazoo mich the beers recipe is also different than the brewers traditional brands after consulting with a lawyer about illinois law governing breweries mr bell believes he can return to the market using new distributors as long as he offers new brands with new recipes "i fully believe the law is on our side " he says about two months ago he says greg mauloff an executive vice president with national wine &amp spirits warned him he would face a long legal fight if he tried to come back to illinois mr mauloff declined to comment mr bells new brew is available in about a dozen bars in the chicago area edward c bronson a software architect in chicago who has known mr bell for years was drinking kalamazoo last week at the clark street ale house also on the citys north side "i wanted to get some tonight because im not sure were going to be able to taste it again " mr bronson a beer judge for regional competitions who used to run a microbrewery said he was annoyed when he learned that bells wouldnt be sold in illinois anymore so much so that he said he went to his local liquor store last year and bought four cases of bells two hearted ale "so i would have a store " comparing kalamazoo with other bells labels mr bronson said it was unlike anything else he has tasted from the company "this is definitely different beer it has a surprising nice malt character that i really enjoy " several recent spats between small brewers and distributors have wound up in court in february new yorks brooklyn brewery inc a fast growing producer of beers such as brooklyn lager and brooklyn brown ale notified one of its distributors gasko &amp meyer inc that it would terminate their agreement brooklyn brewery was disappointed with its sales in the five counties in upstate new york in which gasko &amp meyer sold its beer and complained that the distributor made late deliveries and sometimes delivered stale beer gasko &amp meyer responded by suing the brewer in new york state court claiming among other things that brooklyn brewery failed to properly notify it of any failures to adhere to their distribution deal which began in a judge in september rejected gasko &amp meyers request for a preliminary injunction to keep brooklyn brewery from changing wholesalers its new wholesaler lobo distributing co has rapidly increased sales says steve hindy the brewers president gasko &amp meyers lawsuit is still pending officials at the distributor declined to comment trying to switch distributors "is a big gamble for a small company like ours because these lawyers are not cheap and you want good representation " says mr hindy mr hindy says heightened consumer demand for craft beers is giving small brewers confidence to "assert our rights more forcefully " also emboldening them many distributors that once ignored craft beers are now clamoring to add them to their lineup to increase profits it "is a whole different world for us than has existed in the last years " mr hindy says back in michigan mr bell is bracing for a lawsuit and didnt do much celebrating of his beers return to the windy city he has been taking it easy because he had surgery last month to remove his prostate after being diagnosed with cancer "its major surgery so im watching my energy level " he says "theres plenty of life left for drinking beer " douglas belkin contributed to this article
