cia official in tapes case tended toward caution fellow officers say goal was probably to protect agents in late the abu ghraib prison pictures were still fresh the existence of secret cia prisons had just been revealed and politicians on capitol hill were talking about curtailing "extreme techniques " including the central intelligence agencys own interrogation tactics "its hard for me to believe that senior members of the white house somehow didnt pay attention to this or didnt know about it " said sen chuck hagel r neb a member of the senate intelligence panel washington in late the abu ghraib prison pictures were still fresh the existence of secret cia prisons had just been revealed and politicians on capitol hill were talking about curtailing "extreme techniques " including the central intelligence agencys own interrogation tactics it was within this intense environment that jose a rodriguez jr then chief of the cias national clandestine service ordered the destruction of videotapes recording the interrogations of top al qaeda operatives mr rodriguez who is slated to retire from the agency at the end of the year has become a focal point in the debate over the destruction of the tapes according to several former colleagues his goal likely was to protect the officers who conducted the interrogations from criticism and litigation they also described him as a cautious operator who probably would have ensured that top cia managers new of the plan as a result investigations at the justice department at the cia and in congress could ensnare others at the agency in trying to avert one scandal and dance around the sensitive issue of detainee interrogations the agency may have spawned a far greater controversy "its hard for me to believe that senior members of the white house somehow didnt pay attention to this or didnt know about it " said sen chuck hagel r neb a member of the senate intelligence panel white house spokesman tony fratto declined to comment citing the pending reviews last week the white house said that president bush "has no recollection" of hearing about the tapes or their destruction before he was briefed thursday and that the president supports cia director gen michael v hayden cia spokesman paul gimigliano said "because of the preliminary inquiries under way it would be inappropriate for me at this point to comment publicly " mr rodriguez wasnt available to comment yesterday mr gimigliano said gen hayden said last week that the tapes were destroyed because the agency feared that the identities of the officers would become public and that they would become targets of al qaeda former officers familiar with the events offer a different explanation mr rodriguez had long been concerned that the cia lacked a long term plan for handling interrogations they say he also worried given the response to abu ghraib prison in baghdad and an earlier agency scandal involving the shooting down of a plane that turned out to be carrying peruvian missionaries that lower level officers would take the fall if the videos became public the former colleagues said one former official said interrogators faces were visible on at least one video as were those of more senior officers who happened to be visiting he said mr rodriguez was concerned that "they were carrying out the direction from higher ups in the administration yet the people who would end up getting in trouble are going to be some gs s " referring to a midlevel rank in the federal bureaucracy "jose was concerned about how all this would end " another former senior intelligence official said "he wasnt getting instructions from anybody " officers implementing the program had already voiced worries they might be liable if the political winds shifted some bought liability insurance but feared it wouldnt be sufficient protection mr rodriguez who grew up in puerto rico is a product of what one former agency colleague called "the rough and tumble" latin american division which was responsible for thwarting russian aggression in that part of the world that strategy eventually evolved into the iran contra scandal mr rodriguez was a junior officer at the time he spent most of his cia career in latin america "hes the true spirit of what was an old fashioned case officer in those days loyalty to the cia and nobody else " one of the former colleagues said mr rodriguez was caught up in a scandal in the late s when he tried to use cia contacts to secure the release of a friend arrested on narcotics charges at the time mr rodriguez was the head of the latin american division the justice department opened an investigation but no charges were filed he was brought back into senior management in shortly after the sept attacks as chief of staff of the cias counterterrorism center in that job he took a careful approach to controversial practices such as renditions sending detainees to countries that use more extreme interrogation methods a former colleague said he was seen as a manager who wouldnt question policies from on high several colleagues said later when the agency was in turmoil under then director porter goss he became a stronger advocate for the agencys rank and file officers former colleagues say mr rodriguez was promoted after aides to mr goss clashed with the previous head of the clandestine service in fall he rebuffed an initial request to take the job but relented when it became clear that a goss supporter would be given the position if he didnt take it colleagues say he took the unusual step of remaining undercover because he wanted to retain the ability to travel more easily to cia stations in baghdad kabul afghanistan and elsewhere to talk with officers and shore up flagging morale former colleagues say he decided to drop his cover in august when he announced he would retire at the end of this year sen john rockefeller d w va the head of the senate intelligence committee said mr hayden will testify before congress tomorrow about interrogation and techniques john d mckinnon contributed to this article
