the paygo farce senate democrats gave up on "paygo " as its called when they realized they lacked the votes to offset the &# billion cost of protecting more than million middle class taxpayers from getting whacked by the alternative minimum tax this year mr schumer runs the senate democratic campaign committee and hes raised boatloads of cash from hedge funds and private equity while winking that he can block the houses tax increase on their "carried interest " democrats are committed to ending years of irresponsible budget policies that have produced historic deficits instead of compiling trillions of dollars of debt onto our children and grandchildren we will restore pay as you go budget discipline " speaker nancy pelosi december well as emily littela the half witted gilder radner character on saturday night live would have put it "never mind " last week congressional democrats formally renounced their ballyhooed budget pledge to offset any new tax cuts with other tax increases or spending cuts were delighted to see this false promise go but theres a larger lesson in this failure for the tax and spending battles of senate democrats gave up on "paygo " as its called when they realized they lacked the votes to offset the &# billion cost of protecting more than million middle class taxpayers from getting whacked by the alternative minimum tax this year theyve spent the year floating all kinds of tax increases to make up the difference but in the end they passed an amt relief bill without a penny to pay for it paygo is now pay gone we should stress that this is the right decision for the economy and the federal budget the amt was never supposed to hit the middle class and it only does so now because the democrats who designed it failed to index it for inflation and raised amt rates under bill clinton in with the economy in a slowdown the last thing anyone needs now is a tax hike the budget deficit is a little above of gdp which is below the year average and should remain so as long as the economy keeps growing but paygo shouldnt be allowed to expire without everyone kicking sand on its grave thats because it has been nothing but a confidence game from the very start paygo doesnt apply to domestic discretionary spending and it doesnt restrain spending increases under current law in entitlements like medicare and medicaid its main goals are to make tax cutting all but impossible while letting democrats pretend to favor "fiscal discipline " a la ms pelosis boast above in fact the paygo farce has been unfolding all year since the day they took the gavel democrats have been using gimmick after gimmick to evade it the schip bill for health care for example includes a spending "cliff" that disguises its actual cost it assumes spending would rise to &# billion in but then pretends the costs would fall to less than half that level in which just so happens to fall outside the five year budget scoring window some &# billion in spending over the next years were hidden through this ploy then there is the house farm bill awaiting action in the senate that spending marathon includes between &# billion and &# billion in fictitious paygo savings by shifting the date of farm aid payments from one year to another if a fortune ceo did that sort of thing hed be indicted house democrats realize how humiliating this all is so theyre still vowing to make paygo work especially embarrassed are the so called blue dog democrats for whom "fiscal discipline" is a coat of political protection john tanner of tennessee is so upset he says the senate paygo abdication "is bordering on criminal " and about blue dogs are threatening to vote against amt repeal without offsetting tax increases theyd have more credibility if they also opposed the various fiscal gimmicks in the schip and farm bills not to mention the congressional budget outline that exceeded president bushs budget request by &# billion in any case theyll have to reckon with new york democrat chuck schumer who helped doom paygo in the senate mr schumer runs the senate democratic campaign committee and hes raised boatloads of cash from hedge funds and private equity while winking that he can block the houses tax increase on their "carried interest " lets see paygo or more cash to elect more democrats which do you think wins the larger relevance of this episode concerns the campaign hillary clinton in particular has made paygo a major campaign theme because it makes her sound like a fiscal conservative while helping to justify tax increases but lo guess who was missing on thursday when the senate voted to ignore paygo on the amt none other than the candidate herself along with chris dodd joe biden and barack obama to quote another saturday night live character "how convenient " mr bush and especially the gop presidential candidates should be using this paygo collapse to explain to americans what a charade this democratic line is the tax cuts expire in and paygo will make them all but impossible to extend nows the time to bury paygo for good
