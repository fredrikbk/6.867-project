the tax war between the states the american legislative exchange council has just released a study weve done that presents a economic competitiveness rating of the states based on economic policy variables including taxes regulation right to work the legal system educational freedom and government debt noncompetitive states like new york michigan pennsylvania illinois and new jersey are plagued by falling housing values a shrinking tax base business outmigration capital flight and high unemployment rates and less money for schools roads and aging infrastructure a record eight million americans moved from one state to another last year where is everyone going and why the answer has little to do with climate california has arguably the nicest climate of any state in the nation yet in this decade more americans have left the golden state than entered it migration patterns instead reveal which states have the most dynamic and desirable economies and which are "has been" states the winners in this contest for the most valuable resource on the globe human capital are generally the states with the lowest tax spending and regulatory burdens the biggest losers are almost all congregated in the northeast and midwest liberals contend that tax rates regulations forced union laws and runaway government spending dont matter when it comes to creating jobs high incomes and a higher quality of life people tell us otherwise by voting with their feet the american legislative exchange council has just released a study weve done that presents a economic competitiveness rating of the states based on economic policy variables including taxes regulation right to work the legal system educational freedom and government debt over the past decade the states with the highest taxes and spending and the most intrusive regulations have half the population and job growth and one third slower growth in incomes than the most economically free states in alone people each day moved to the states with the highest economic competitiveness from the states with the lowest competitiveness of all the policy variables we examined two stand out as perhaps the most important in attracting jobs and capital the first is the income tax rate states with the highest income tax rates california and new york for example are significantly outperformed by the nine states with no income tax such as texas and florida as a study from the atlanta federal reserve board put it "relative marginal tax rates have a statistically significant negative relationship with relative state growth " the other factor for attracting jobs and capital is right to work laws states that permit workers to be compelled to join unions have much lower rates of employment growth than states that dont many companies say they will not even consider locating a factory in a state that does not have a right to work law our study also finds that states with antigrowth tax and spending policies dont just lose people noncompetitive states like new york michigan pennsylvania illinois and new jersey are plagued by falling housing values a shrinking tax base business outmigration capital flight and high unemployment rates and less money for schools roads and aging infrastructure these factors of decline hurt the poor the most the northeast is the classic case of a region suffering from self inflicted wounds in the year it was home to a smaller share of the u s population and produced a smaller percentage of americas total value added than at any time in the nations history why one big reason is that governments in the northeast are about one fifth more expensive than in the rest of america &# versus &# of state spending per resident an average income family of four still saves &# in lower income property sales taxes and fees by moving to just an average tax state and more like &# a year by moving to say florida since the northeastern states tend to have highly progressive tax systems the incentive to flee is even greater for higher income earners northeasterners complain disdainfully of the "war between the states" for jobs and businesses and for good reason they cant win southern and western states are cherry picking companies from the north atlantic states one southern governor who didnt want to be identified recently told us his state had closed its economic development offices in europe "why search for factories overseas when we can plunder high tax areas like connecticut and new york " he said auto and other manufacturing jobs are still being created in america but in alabama north carolina and even mississippi it has to be infuriating to northeasterners to learn that people and businesses are "trading up" by moving out of their region to the likes of georgia and alabama but they are the states losing population are in effect suffering from a slow motion version of the economic sclerosis that paralyzed much of europe in the s and s particularly france and germany with their massive welfare systems at least the european socialist nations are finally starting to change their taxing and spending ways to win back jobs no such luck in this country five of the states near the bottom of our competitiveness ratings illinois maryland michigan new jersey and wisconsin have enacted major tax increases in the last two years maryland and michigan just raised business and income taxes on upper income earners while arguing that raising the cost of doing business will attract more businesses more likely it will induce companies to stay away and people to move out mr laffer is president of laffer associates mr moore is senior economics writer for the wall street journal editorial board
