scientists link genes role in breast cancer associated press researchers say theyve discovered a major reason why women who inherit a mutated version of the gene brca run a high risk of breast cancer and that finding might aid the search for new treatments associated press researchers say theyve discovered a major reason why women who inherit a mutated version of the gene brca run a high risk of breast cancer and that finding might aid the search for new treatments a second gene called pten plays a key role scientists said in a study released yesterday scientists have long known that brca normally repairs damage to other genes so if it is crippled by mutations the unrepaired damage could be expected to lead to cancer but the specifics of that story have been murky the new study fingers pten which normally acts as a brake on cancer the researchers found evidence that in breast cancers associated with a brca mutation pten is often broken and doesnt get repaired that sets off a chemical cascade that leads to malignancy this is "probably a major way" that defects in brca can produce breast cancer said ramon parsons of columbia university who reports the work with colleagues on the web site of nature genetics pten was discovered about years ago and scientists know a lot about it and the chemical pathway that gets activated when pten is disabled he said drug companies have been testing drugs in animals that seek to treat tumors by interrupting that cascade and they have gotten some encouraging results he said breast cancers associated with the brca gene are generally aggressive and have a poor prognosis brca and its cousin brca account for less than of all breast cancers
