philanthropy a special report how charities can make themselves more open we give billions of dollars to causes we believe in so why do we know so little about how effectively the money is used a recent study by the center on philanthropy at indiana university found that high net worth americans who already contribute two thirds of household charitable giving would give more if nonprofits could rein in administrative costs and better demonstrate the impact of donations the past few years have brought a string of reports of flagrant charity and foundation abuses officials who waste money on dubious fund raising ploys or lavish executive perks its been said we expect too much of charities perhaps the real problem is that we expect too little last year americans gave &# billion to charity up roughly from a decade ago this surging bounty reflects our native belief in giving back to society and a stubborn aversion to paying taxes it feels good to help others and get a deduction at the same time but the warm feeling fades when we try to find out about charities successes and failures donors can easily find raw financial information about charities such as revenue and spending figures as well as the name of whoever runs the operation but those numbers wont tell you whether a charitys programs are working or failing consider a charity that raises money to help the blind function independently typically the charity cant show that the people it helped achieved higher employment rates than they would have without its help donors who want that kind of detailed analysis usually must do it themselves or rely on guesswork and that makes it difficult if not impossible to figure out whether one groups approach to solving a problem is better than anothers thats not good enough its time to make sure our gifts are being used as intelligently as possible instead of showering hard earned dollars on charities and hoping for the best we need to demand clear detailed information on the results of their efforts we ask the government and public corporations to be transparent and accountable charities should meet the same standard specifically charities and foundations should provide detailed information on their web sites everything from board members and their bios to an open discussion about problems theyve encountered while trying to achieve their goals charities should also explain to donors how they measure their effectiveness and stop flouting existing efforts at self regulation finally more charities should embrace rigorous forms of evaluation and report their findings to the public if charities and foundations were more open about the problems they face the public would have a better understanding of the hard work they do armed with this knowledge who knows americans might very well dig even deeper into their pockets to help charities in their struggle a recent study by the center on philanthropy at indiana university found that high net worth americans who already contribute two thirds of household charitable giving would give more if nonprofits could rein in administrative costs and better demonstrate the impact of donations these arent just abstract issues charities are looming large in americas future as a number of worrisome trends converge a growing wealth gap and rising cost of living are putting huge pressures on families older workers are losing jobs to consolidation and technological change and are unable to find new employment people are living longer yet many will be unable to support themselves in their twilight years nonprofit officials must take the hard steps necessary to ensure that effective charities can get their story out and be rewarded with public support approaches that arent effective should stop soaking up dollars better spent elsewhere of course any proposals for change face big hurdles perhaps the biggest a culture of secrecy that keeps many charities from openly discussing their operations especially efforts that have failed the past few years have brought a string of reports of flagrant charity and foundation abuses officials who waste money on dubious fund raising ploys or lavish executive perks but most of the time nonprofit officials keep quiet out of habit or fear and they face no consequences for withholding more meaningful information about the outcome of their work so they see no reason to change take the case of the better business bureaus wise giving alliance which evaluates charities following public inquiry so donors can make more informed decisions about where to put their money this year about of the charities that the alliance asked for information failed to provide it up from four years ago in many cases "they choose not to participate because they dont want the donating public to know" that they dont meet the groups standards says art taylor chief executive of wise giving alliance in other cases he says "charities are just getting going and they dont want to take the time to bother themselves with providing the information because theyre finding out how difficult it is to manage the day to day operations of a charity " charities even ignore supposedly mandatory requests for disclosure the internal revenue service for instance explicitly asks charities to supply information about their performance each year "all organizations must describe their exempt purpose achievements in a clear and concise manner " reads the irss charity document form "state the number of clients served publications issued etc discuss achievements that are not measurable " yet charities routinely skip these requests without penalty in theory charities that dont fill out form fully and accurately are subject to fines in practice the irs has focused its limited resources on more flagrant abuses such as excessive compensation and the use of charitable funds for terrorism purposes many charities say they support the idea of better measurement but resist reporting results publicly arguing that their work is tough to judge officials often say that the problems they are trying to solve can take many years to address and that progress is therefore difficult to measure moreover charities worry that too much candor about their struggles could cause donors to take their money elsewhere thats true but it doesnt absolve them of the need to explain their winning and losing efforts to the public just as publicly traded companies must release detailed information on their profits and losses "i think we get irrational pushback from nonprofits who say you cant measure mission centered work " says brian gallagher chief executive of united way of america and chairman of independent sector a coalition of charity and philanthropy leaders "you most certainly can the question is are you committed to do it and then are you committed to report on it " without such information says philanthropist gerald greenwald the retired chairman of united airlines "those that are really succeeding dont get the applause and money they should and those that arent doing very well seem to just live on forever " just as important other well intentioned people trying to solve the same complex problems are likely to repeat the same mistakes others have made or overlook promising opportunities because of the information vacuum "talking about what hasnt worked will help the nonprofit sectors credibility with the donating public " says iowa senator charles grassley who has been pressing nonprofits to reform "most important it will help make sure charities are more effective in helping the needy " moreover if charities dont set tougher standards congress may do it for them speaking before a gathering of charity officials in october steven t miller commissioner of the irss tax exempt and government entities division issued this stark warning "failure to self regulate now may result in a lost opportunity for you to do so later " so what could charities or the government do to make their work more successful here are three suggestions that could make a difference too many charities fail to make information about their accomplishments struggles boards and executive staff easily available online as a first step charities should offer detailed financial and management information on their web sites easy access to such information is crucial for helping donors form reasoned opinions about a charitys mission effectiveness and leadership a small but growing number of nonprofits are starting to measure and report publicly on successes and failures in october the american cancer society released a page "progress report" aimed at tracking progress toward its goals of reducing cancer rates by while the report highlighted certain successes it also spotlighted failures including the societys likely inability to reduce the incidence of lung cancer by by this kind of disclosure "is where i believe the sector is going " says catherine mickle the cancer societys chief financial officer as donors begin to think more like investors "we are trying to hold ourselves to that standard before it gets applied to us " some watchdog groups operate online databases about charities theyre certainly helpful as a central resource but most of them are limited by the lack of available information take guidestar org an electronic database that posts the irs forms that charities file every year guidestar supplements this data by organizing and analyzing the forms and collecting more information from charities but there are limits to what guidestar can do because charities sometimes dont disclose necessary information and the form itself has shortcomings the form provides information about how much money the charities took in and where they spent it but almost no information about the actual effects of that spending beyond that only organizations with annual revenue of &# or more are required to file the form that amounts to about of active charities which leaves a big gap in available data by the time guidestar can put the information online its sometimes as much as two years old and nonprofits dont always go out of their way to update it says phil buchanan president of the center for effective philanthropy a nonprofit that helps foundations evaluate their programs  adopt higher standards in the wake of charity abuses much time and attention has been focused on measuring charity efficiency but charities complain that concentrating on administrative costs discourages investments in sound management others say its easy for charities to fudge the numbers underreporting true administrative costs to make themselves look more efficient these debates obscure the bigger problem there is no system for measuring and reporting charity results simply put "most charities that seek to be charitable could easily pass almost any test for simple charitable status and still not be very effective in their charitable efforts " said eugene steuerle a senior fellow at the urban institute in a series of papers he released this summer a number of philanthropy leaders are starting to address the need for greater accountability in a series of independent proposals theyre trying to set up voluntary standards for charities to follow in assessing their operations and results the proposals are still in the planning stage but they offer a good snapshot of the concerns more nonprofits should address the william and flora hewlett foundation has commissioned consultants mckinsey &amp co to come up with a system that would report on charities achievements including the measures charities use to track their work "it is disquieting that philanthropists have access to so little of the kinds of information that private investors rely on " wrote paul brest president of the foundation this summer in the foundations annual report mr greenwald the former airline chief has committed more than &# toward developing a system to measure charities progress in achieving their service missions a group he co founded the nonprofit reporter is talking with christine letts at the hauser center for nonprofit organizations at harvard universitys john f kennedy school of government about starting a demonstration program that would compare the results of at least charities the council on foundations which represents foundation interests recently tapped a former director with the government accountability office sigurd nilsen to help foundations figure out the impact of their work and tell that story to the public at large a group of leading charity officials called the panel on the nonprofit sector recently convened at the urging of congress to pursue areas for revamping in october the group released a list of "principles" for good governance and ethical practice for instance the principles advise charitable organizations to "consider" making information available on the methods they use to evaluate the outcomes of their work  adhere to those standards the problem with voluntary standards of course is that they can be ignored without risk as many charities now do regulators have stepped up their efforts to enforce broader compliance and to reduce the inaccuracies and incomplete statements that riddle too many charity tax documents the irs is preparing to shift to electronic filing for form partly in an effort to make it more difficult to provide incomplete answers if a charity official skips a question in the electronic form the computer program will spit it back but given its limited resources and legal mandate the irs wont be able to track all charity activities indeed agency officials have indicated that the irs doesnt intend to press charities to report how effective they are marcus owens the former head of the irss tax exempt division and now a lawyer in private practice with caplin &amp drysdale in washington d c suggests that charities collaborate with the government to develop an independent oversight board to regulate charities the board would include representatives from the charity world plus government and independent directors membership would be mandatory and groups that didnt meet the standards could be subject to penalties or possible action by the irs so far mr owenss idea hasnt gotten much traction congress and charity leaders are grappling with other big issues such as whether nonprofits should be required to spend more of their massive endowments a good starting point is to insist that charities regulate their conduct on their own every group should pick standards and adhere to them and let the public know exactly how theyre doing if charities and foundations oppose any sort of self regulation says diana aviv chief executive of independent sector that "raises the question of whether you think you should be free to behave in any which way and if you feel that way then you shouldnt take a tax deduction " ms beatty is a special writer in the wall street journals new york bureau she can be reached at sally beatty wsj com
