the limits of intelligence the combination of international pressure economic sanctions and the presence of u s troops on irans borders may have indeed convinced tehran to abandon its nuclear weapons program as the nie states with "high confidence " on one of our several trips together to iraq a senior intelligence official told us how she wrote her assessments on one page with three sections what we know what we dont know and what we think it means sound simple actually its very hard the limitations of the intelligence community are unfortunately well known to us as past leaders of the house intelligence committee we both saw the intelligence on iraqs wmd in the run up to the war as well as the failure to detect the plot or predict indias rise to the ranks of nuclear armed nations as a result we coauthored along with sens susan collins and joe lieberman the intelligence reform &amp terrorism prevention act since then we have monitored the intelligence community as it tries to reinvent itself and become a strong world class organization and we have worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen the capability of the intelligence community to penetrate targets those efforts are moving forward but we still have work to do we are not convinced we have the necessary access to form definitive conclusions on irans future plans or the plans and intentions of other hard targets as lawmakers on homeland security and intelligence we want hard information on what is actually happening on the ground moreover the only way congress can have faith in the intelligence we receive is for the administration and intelligence community to follow the law by keeping the congressional intelligence committees "fully and currently" informed on intelligence matters the controversy over the recording and destruction of interrogation tapes by the central intelligence agency underscores this point and the negative consequences when they dont still intelligence is in many ways an art not an exact science the complete reversal from the national intelligence estimate on irans nuclear weapons program to the latest nie serves as its own caution in this regard the information we receive from the intelligence community is but one piece of the puzzle in a rapidly changing world it is not a substitute for policy and the challenge for policy makers is to use good intelligence wisely to fashion good policy in fact the new nie on iran comes closest to the three part model our intelligence community strives for it carefully describes sources and the analysts assessment of their reliability what gaps remain in their understanding of irans intentions and capabilities and how confident they are of their conclusions yet it ignores some key questions most importantly it does not explain why the nie came to the opposite conclusion or what factors could drive iran to "restart" its nuclear weapons program we were among the loudest voices in demanding more intelligence on the status of irans program and its intent to construct nuclear weapons in a joint television interview we raised serious concerns about the quality and extent of our intelligence communitys penetration of iran we were concerned that some of the conclusions being reached were based on scant reporting our view is that there were more gaps in our coverage of iran than many were willing to admit at the time intelligence is essential in countering proliferation challenges from state and nonstate actors and national security issues should be bipartisan and debated in a constructive manner recognizing that sometimes based on the information available what we believe in good faith to be true may turn out to be wrong lawmakers have a constitutional obligation to understand and investigate these issues this is why we have traveled extensively throughout the middle east north africa pakistan and afghanistan to assess the situation firsthand and why we both recently signed a letter responding to a request from iranian parliamentarians to meet with them the purpose of the meeting would not be foreign policy but to learn and hopefully fill in some of the gaps in information we receive from the intelligence community though the new nie may be taken as positive news iran clearly remains dangerous the combination of international pressure economic sanctions and the presence of u s troops on irans borders may have indeed convinced tehran to abandon its nuclear weapons program as the nie states with "high confidence " nevertheless congress must engage in vigorous oversight to challenge those who do intelligence work and to make site visits to see for ourselves intelligence is an investment in people and technology it requires sustained focus funding and leadership it also requires agency heads that prioritize their constitutional duty to keep the intelligence committees informed good intelligence will not guarantee good policy but it can spare us some huge policy mistakes mr
