after talks fail writers strike could drag on the collapse of talks between striking screenwriters and the nations film and television producers sets the stage for a long cold winter in hollywood that could effectively shut down much of the entertainment industry and usher in sweeping changes in the tv business the collapse of talks between striking screenwriters and the nations film and television producers sets the stage for a long cold winter in hollywood that could effectively shut down much of the entertainment industry and usher in sweeping changes in the tv business hopes for an early resolution of the strike which enters its sixth week today were dashed late friday after officials from the alliance of motion picture and television producers which negotiates on behalf of the studios broke off talks with the writers guild of america at a los angeles hotel the breakdown came amid signs of rancor and finger pointing that suggested growing distrust between the two sides as the entertainment industry enters the digital age the writers and the studios are battling over a key question how writers should be compensated when studios distribute their work in digital forms such as streaming and downloads digital media are expected to provide an increasing share of hollywoods revenue in coming years last weeks talks however bogged down over side issues that included the unions attempts to organize reality tv and animation writers and its effort to remove a clause from its current contract preventing it from joining strikes by other hollywood unions barring the emergence of a new mediator who can ride to the rescue hollywood is starting to come to terms with the idea that the walkout could drag on well into the tv networks are feeling the most heat without writers they have been forced to shut down many of their productions in the past month now they have just a handful of their most successful shows left in the can the december holidays when networks typically rely more on movies and specials give them some breathing room but network executives have been hard at work in recent days exploring ways to scatter what little original programming they have left across next years schedules artful scheduling of remaining episodes of scripted shows will cushion the blow in january walt disney co s abc television for instance has a couple of episodes of "desperate housewives" and "greys anatomy" that it can stretch out by such means as longer recaps of previous episodes after that the network has a few new midseason scripted shows it is planning to debut the impact of a prolonged strike could go far beyond this season the broadcast networks already grappling with a slow decline in viewers depend heavily on new episodes of shows to draw audiences without new dramas and comedies they will have to rely on reality shows game shows and stunt specials a glut of which could send audiences flocking to other forms of entertainment "theres a huge transition in our business " steven bochco creator of the tv hits "l a law" and "nypd blue " said in a recent interview "this may hasten the demise of the model that weve all worked under " indeed network executives say the strike could be the trigger needed to change many of the industrys arcane and expensive practices among them the pilot season beginning each january the networks approve production of more than pilot versions of tv shows which are cast and produced in a matter of weeks so they can be ready in may in time to be considered for the networks fall seasons the pilots cost millions of dollars apiece to make and many never see the light of day the system is an anachronism that dates from the early days of tv when big fall premieres were more important and detroit would use them to introduce its new car models the schedule has also been reinforced by other antiquated practices including summer hiatuses which tv adopted in its infancy from the world of radio serials and seasonal "sweeps" periods used to set local advertising rates tv production studios have already been moving toward more year round program development shooting pilots at other times of the year as a way to sidestep the costly race for talent that occurs during pilot season and to lavish more time and attention on their shows the networks are also likely to revisit the "upfront" model of selling advertising each may the networks put on expensive presentations to advertisers of the new shows they plan to air in the fall the networks have long questioned that model but none of them wanted to be the first to drop out at a media conference in new york last week jeff zucker president and chief executive of general electric co s nbc universal unit suggested that in the event of a prolonged strike a similar ad sales period might still make sense but perhaps not a "grand presentation" in the spring "i dont think there is any rule that says we have to do it that way " he said so far the networks say they havent felt any impact from advertisers pulling out of shows that is partly because the market for tv advertising time has been strong with little spare inventory available and advertisers worry they might have to buy back time later at a higher price if they pull out now a long strike however could change their calculations on the film side a handful of projects already have been postponed because of script problems they include "angels &amp demons " the follow up from sony corp s sony pictures to last years "the da vinci code" united artists "pinkville " an oliver stone directed film about the vietnam war era my lai massacre and warner bros "shantaram " a tale set in india starring johnny depp the strike came too late to affect the major studios slate of releases for next year largely because movie production cycles are so long but it remains unclear how the strike might affect the annual hollywood awards shows and the race to promote films and their creative teams for those awards not having the late night talk shows to use as film promotion vehicles has been a handicap for hollywood those shows which have been forced into reruns were among the first casualties of the strike "for people opening films right now even the big mainstream films to not get people on shows like letterman really hurts them " says bob berney president of picturehouse a time warner inc film label after presenting a counterproposal to the writers friday afternoon nicholas counter the studios chief negotiator told his union counterpart david young that evening that until the writers removed six provisions from their proposal talks wouldnt resume "were willing to continue to negotiate but were not going to give in to ultimatums nor have we made ultimatums " said jeff hermanson assistant executive director of the writers unions west coast branch in an interview friday "thats not bargaining and its certainly not a partnership " the writers and the hollywood studios now are expected to try to pressure the directors guild of america whose contract with the studios expires june but that could create friction in hollywoods normally clubby creative community in a show of solidarity with the writers the directors who usually strike an early deal with the studios have delayed the start of their official negotiations historically hollywoods creative unions have tended to accept the terms of whichever deal was struck first a system called pattern bargaining this time however the writers have indicated they wouldnt necessarily accept the same deal directors might make with the studios lev l spiro who directs episodes and pilots of tv series such as showtimes "weeds" and abcs "ugly betty " sent a letter to the leadership of the directors union last week arguing that starting talks would be a public relations disaster for the directors and would prolong the writers strike the letter circulated among writers and directors "we are all to state the obvious sister guilds of artists and craftsmen engaged in collective bargaining with corporate behemoths whose primary raison detre is to make profit " mr spiro wrote "i suggest to you that it would be shortsighted to act exclusively in our own self interest at this time " a spokeswoman for the directors guild said the collapse of the talks between the writers and the studios was "very disappointing news" and "there has been no decision on when or if to enter negotiations" with the producers
