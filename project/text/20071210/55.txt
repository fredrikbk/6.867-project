philanthropy a special report cause and effect though small firms may lack the cash to make major gifts they can still make a big difference in their communities joe crosby co founder of a small seneca s c company that sells seasonings and other foods donates to charity in various ways but instead of writing checks to high profile national or international organizations he supports and gets involved with causes close to home his company coachs low country brands hosts a charity golf tournament every august to raise money to help elementary school teachers buy classroom supplies something teachers typically must pay for themselves this year the tournament raised about &# through corporate sponsorships and a raffle the company later gave teachers in the county each a &# gift card to staples inc "i will always take care of my county and my state first " says mr crosby "because my business started in south carolina " small businesses which often lack big financial resources find lots of creative ways to support local causes in lieu of cash gifts they often use their ties in the community to help raise money they also donate goods and services or office space to nonprofits and encourage employees to volunteer during work hours such practices arent just good for the community theyre also good for business "we advise folks to choose causes that really leverage their business so it feels like a natural extension of what the business is about " says mark feldman principal and managing director of cause consulting group a boston consulting firm that advises businesses on their philanthropic activities a doctors office might raise funds to support a health related cause like juvenile diabetes for example some companies give a slice of profits from a particular product to charity and entwine the do good message into the products packaging and marketing smaller businesses traditionally have been more informal and less strategic about their giving mr feldman adds but theyre becoming more strategic in many ways small businesses have advantages over large companies when it comes to giving says liz callanan president of the sustainable business network in greater boston employees of small businesses usually know one another making it easier to organize a charitable effort small businesses also can use their charitable efforts locally to raise their profile in the community "a small business has to do things that feel like a good fit to the organization " ms callanan says "so i look to the employees and the products and services of the company " many small companies let their employees select charitable causes to support and some small business owners sit on the boards of local charitable groups the size of the business affects how it gives a very small family owned business is more likely to give to causes the owner is passionate about while a larger small business is more likely to engage employees in the philanthropic activities and decisions a common way companies give is through in kind donations donating their products or services instead of cash it makes sense for many businesses because they dont have to spend precious real dollars and often in kind donations allow the business to give and market itself simultaneously boston beer co brewer of samuel adams beers looks for ways to give beyond just writing a check says jim koch who

requests to be sure charitable giving can be a powerful marketing tool mr crosby of coachs low country brands raises money for colleges and universities in the southeast by putting the schools logos on some bottles of his seasoning and donating &# from each sale of the &# bottles to the schools scholarship funds "some people buy it because they see im donating money to their local schools " he
