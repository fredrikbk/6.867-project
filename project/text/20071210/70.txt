questioning middle east assumptions as an american jew i find bernard lewis commentary "on the jewish question " op ed nov lacking i was taught in hebrew school that we jews returned to a land of empty swamps and created a great country that idea is proven false by the fact that palestinian men women and children were made refugees the elephant that no one seems willing to talk about is whether palestinians get to return to their homes in israel given that jews came to palestine to create a jewish state and had to take the land away from the palestinians living there theres no way to call the palestinians the aggressors in this conflict if palestinians were allowed to return to their homes and hamas is involved and accepting of such a plan we would have peace steve feldman winston salem n c professor lewis sound argument about arab acceptance of israels existence has one technical flaw the two examples he cites of population exchange india pakistan germany poland involved groups that were both long time residents in the disputed territory in the case of palestine however despite the continuous existence a small jewish community the jews had only recently returned en masse after an absence of years moreover this influx occurred under british league of nations protection and over the violent objections of the palestinians arabs and muslims who had lived in and dominated that part of the world for over a millennium a good case can be made that large scale jewish immigration to palestine was justified for humanitarian reasons and partition population exchange may have been a fair solution once a large jewish population existed in palestine but the palestinians still have a legitimate grievance for being forced by outside powers to endure the anomalous return of the jews which then led to the normative partition population exchange that professor lewis defends gary l goldman pacific palisades calif mr lewis states the obvious that the world seems to ignore israel has a right to live and that question must be answered loud and clear before even coming to the table to negotiate i know jewish families born in syria egypt iraq and other countries of the region that were forced out with nothing but the clothes on their back they have resettled here and around the world and made new lives for themselves and their children how can a group of arab leaders insist on a right of return for palestinians unless they offer the same to their own expelled former citizens moreover stop the suicide attacks mortar attacks and killing of innocents and there will be a true chance for peace joe shamie brooklyn n y see related letter "letters to the editor no jews were there before most palestinians" wsj dec
