options hinder efforts to gauge economic growth federal reserve officials are usually preoccupied with how fast the u s economy will grow in the coming year but lately they have tried to figure out how much it grew last year to be precise they wonder if the u s economy grew in the fourth quarter last year from a year earlier as the governments gross domestic product data suggest or a more robust as measured by the lesser known gross domestic income it isnt an idle exercise if the stronger number is right it would help explain why unemployment has remained so low it would also suggest that productivity growth has remained relatively robust rather than slowing sharply as the regular data imply strong productivity growth means the economy can grow faster without pushing up inflation unfortunately a closer examination of the data suggests the stronger number is misleading the reason employees are reaping big gains on stock options but the cost of those options probably isnt fully reflected in corporate profits the commerce departments bureau of economic analysis measures the nations economic output two ways total spending or gdp and total income or gdi in theory the two should be equal but in practice they seldom are because they are drawn from different sources and are subject to differing sampling and measurement challenges occasionally the divergence signals something important in the s former fed chairman alan greenspan posited that the fact gdi was growing faster than gdp was a clue that productivity or output per worker was growing faster than official data suggested people were producing and earning more he figured but gdp wasnt capturing it more recently a study by fed staff economist jeremy nalewaik argues that gdi is better than gdp at identifying recessions and "an increased focus on gdi may be useful in assessing the current state of the economy " last thursdays report on this years first quarter economic growth hurt and helped the case of those who thought gdi was signaling greater strength than gdp it showed that while gdp grew just at an annual rate in the quarter adjusted for inflation gdi fell in the same report the bea sharply raised its estimate of fourth quarter gdi showing it stronger than a year earlier a full percentage point faster than gdp growth in the same period because measuring both gdp and gdi is so complex it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the discrepancy and it may never be resolved one possible explanation is that gdp has been underestimated and will be revised higher that would help explain why the u s job market is so strong but a more likely explanation is that gdi has been overestimated and may be revised lower heres why stock options are a growing and highly volatile part of employee compensation suppose an employee has an option to buy his companys stock at &# and the stock is trading at &# if the employee exercises that option and buys the stock the &# profit even if the stock isnt sold is treated as income both by the internal revenue service and the bea and as an expense to the company option income however is hard to measure its not included in the bureau of labor statistics monthly wage figures the bea has to estimate it and it may undercount it when a rising stock market increases the profits from exercised options four months after the end of each quarter the bea does get more comprehensive labor income figures that include options a year ago that led to a big upward revisions in first quarter income last week it led to a similar upward revision in fourth quarter income the data dont tell the bea where the extra income came from the evidence suggests options figures from thomson financial suggest those were the first and fifth most lucrative quarters ever for corporate officers directors and other "insiders" cashing in options in theory that added option income should have reduced corporate profits by an equivalent amount but quarterly shareholder reports an important source for the beas quarterly profit calculations deduct far less than the entire value of an exercised option as an expense the bea gets its first look at that value a year later when companies file their annual reports and it takes up to another year for the final figures to come from the irs theres a good chance that later this year the bea will revise down last years profit data shrinking gdi until that happens the additional options income is in effect double counted in employee income and in artificially high profits there is a good chance that later this year the bea will revise down last years profit data shrinking gdi until that happens options income is in effect double counted in employee income and in artificially high profits a bea official concedes such double counting is a "possibility " while adding "weve learned from experience its difficult to understand all of the factors that affect corporate profits " given the strength of the u s stock market so far could the same phenomenon occur this year so far it looks unlikely thomson financial data suggest insider profits on options in the first quarter while still hefty were down from a year ago
