agencies don lab coats to reach consumers firms deploy scientists within creative groups to make messages stick madison avenue home to black turtleneck wearing creative executives is opening the door to lab coat wearing scientists as it seeks to get deeper into the heads of consumers the latest example concerns ocean sprays new commercial for diet cranberry juice the ad doesnt use flashy graphics racy images or any other bells and whistles that would mark it as different but it was created with input from a cognitive scientist the spot features two men in the role of cranberry growers standing knee deep in a bog the duo has been appearing in ocean spray ads since late but for this spot they are joined by a group of women who are exercising that idea came from lisa haverty who has a ph d in cognitive science from carnegie mellon university in earlier iterations the women in the ad were having a party ms haverty who works full time for the boston agency of havass arnold where she occasionally walks around in a lab coat argued that the exercise class would more quickly send the diet message the party image she believed would only confuse viewers because they would spend too much time trying to figure out why the group is celebrating that wasnt the only way ms haverty who studies the ways people perceive things influenced the ad she also decided that the main characters should wait a few seconds before mentioning the new diet product which goes against the longtime golden rule in advertising that you should hit consumers with a product name as early as possible to make sure it sticks her reasoning because of additional action in the ad the exercising viewers would need a second to process the images the addition of scientists to the process marks a big departure from how madison avenue typically works which is to rely largely on creative teams including an art director and writer more firms are testing the waters about two years ago phd a media buying firm owned by omnicom group added a new "neuroplanning" software program created with the help of fmri brain scans and neuroscience to help it decide which media to use for ad campaigns another ad firm crispin porter + bogusky has a consulting arrangement with a cognitive anthropologist who frequently helps on new ad campaigns the miami based shop had him talk to consumers as part of the research it did before crafting a coke zero ad campaign "the growing amount of advertising clutter on the airwaves is driving the need for a more scientific approach " says peter mears a managing partner at phd many ad executives pooh pooh the idea of a more scientific approach to creating commercials "i think its a trend going through the business " says allen adamson author of "brandsimple" and a managing director at landor associates a branding firm "agencies cant differentiate themselves this is just about advertising agencies trying to fight off being commoditized " even ms haverty concedes that many ad executives because of their years of experience and use of research and focus groups are already "untrained psychologists " she says her input is about trying to "slightly improve their success rates " each of the tweaks ms haverty makes is based on theories in cognitive science adapted to the realities of marketing she says for example one theory is that the more engaged a person is while processing information the more likely he or she is to be able to recall that information later in other words information that we have to work to comprehend has a greater chance of sticking in our memory in the ocean spray spot the presence of the women exercising will form a question in the consumers mind about why theyre exercising she says people will want to seek an answer which will make the image more memorable the problem with the previous version of the ad the women partying in the background is that answering the question of why the women are there takes too long and the consumer may simply give up she says the ocean spray diet ad scored in the top of ads tested by millward brown which measures whether consumers remember ads the spot outperformed another version of the cranberry juice commercial that used a familiar ad industry formula a taste test salim sitafalwalla an account group director at millward brown says ads that score that high "will cause a short term sales lift " its still too early to tell if that will happen the ocean spray ad only hit the airwaves two weeks ago
