warner music still considers emi serenade options remain to snag prized record labels despite a rival offer despite appearances to the contrary the seven year mating dance between emi group plc and warner music group corp is far from over warner and emi have tried to merge at least four times in recent years never clinching a deal then in may emis board recommended that shareholders accept terra firma capital partners ltd s offer of pence &# a share or gbp billion &# billion five pence a share higher than warners most recent gbp billion effort but despite the apparent victory of the private equity buyers warners executives and investors are still deliberating over two courses of action they believe could get them what they have wanted from emi all along the british music giants recorded music assets including the storied labels capitol records in the u s and parlophone in britain emis labels which produce and distribute cds and digital downloads from artists such as coldplay norah jones and the beatles are distinct from its giant music publishing house which controls catalogs of song copyrights that are licensed to others for use warners shares have dropped more than from a high of more than &# last summer when emi offered to buy warner for &# billion emis shares have rebounded from a february low of pence when it issued a profit warning on news of london based terra firmas offer and speculation that others might be imminent in trading friday on the new york stock exchange warner musics shares fell five cents to &# emis stock closed down pence to gbp in london trading warners shares trade at about times analysts estimated per share earnings for this year according to thomson first call that is slightly richer than emis price earnings ratio of the simplest course of action for warner is to counter terra firmas bid but people close to warner say they believe the firm is unlikely to go much higher than its original gbp billion offer even if warner acquired emi antitrust reasons mean it would almost certainly need to sell the publishing house that unit remains the largest music publishing house in the world based on market share although it is soon to be eclipsed by vivendi sas universal music publishing which is about to close an acquisition that will vault it past emi warners warner chappell publishing unit for the moment is the second largest in the world but warner music whose artists include madonna linkin park and led zeppelin has an alternate route to capturing emis record labels it could do that by striking a deal with terra firma to buy the record labels after the buyout firms transaction closes there are risks and benefits associated with both paths people close to warner say and they expect to decide which is more appealing indeed a third option these people say is for warner to do nothing with emi on the theory that record labels have been losing revenue and value so rapidly that resources might be best deployed in other kinds of deals such as investing in new businesses altogether the main upside to waiting and making a deal with terra firma these people say is that the regulatory scrutiny in europe of a deal to buy only emis record labels would probably be much less intense than scrutiny of a deal to buy the entire company even if warner said up front that it intends to resell the publishing house the main risk to a wait and see approach is uncertainty people close to warner say they are confident that terra firma would be willing to part with emis record labels but there is always the possibility that a stronger bid than terra firmas could emerge and there is no guarantee that bidder would be willing to sell and it is possible that terra firma could change its mind or make its own changes at emi before selling to warner "if i was terra firma im not sure id be in a huge rush to sell this to warner " says richard greenfield an analyst at new yorks pali research "how much more desperate does warner become to buy emi in a year or two " mr greenfield in february downgraded his rating on warner to "sell" from "neutral" and has since said he would recommend selling a combined warner emi pali and mr greenfield dont follow emi or own shares in or do business with either company warner and emi have been eager to merge their recorded music operations for years amid precipitously declining cd sales and a weaker than anticipated rise in digital downloads the two companies are each about half the size of the two much larger companies that dominate the recorded music landscape universal music group and sony bmg a joint venture of sony corp and bertelsmann ag a warner emi merger could save an estimated &# million to &# million in overhead but four rounds of talks since have faltered on issues of price and control if warner bids for the whole company it faces a lengthy regulatory review process in europe that carries some risk of disapproval though people involved in the talks say they have been heartened by a recent decision by regulators to allow vivendis acquisition of bmg music publishing the regulators also are in the process of reconsidering the merger of sonys and bertelsmanns recorded music operations people in the music industry believe an approval could come soon as added insurance warner has struck a deal to gain the blessing of a coalition of independent european record labels the same body that brought the original complaint about the sony bmg merger warner has also added a "breakup fee" of about &# million to the terms of its offer according to people familiar with the matter payable to emi if the deal falls apart further complicating the situation bad blood persists between top executives at warner and emi it is unclear how much of emis current management would be left in place if terra firma were to close the deal but both sets of executives have historically resisted any deal that would make them subordinate to the other side increasing the pressure on warner to get a deal done the overall music market has underperformed compared with the expectations of investors who bought warner from time
