investing in funds a monthly analysis mixing it up a portfolios big core a financial planner recommends broad market funds as a solid foundation with the riskiest action in satellites put the bulk of your money in broad market index funds and use a small portion to try riskier investments thats the investing mantra of evensky &amp katz wealth management a coral gables fla fee only financial planning firm that works with wealthy individuals in this column we ask prominent financial advisers who use mutual and exchange traded funds to share their model asset allocations for certain kinds of investors harold evensky founder and president of evensky &amp katz a firm that currently manages about &# million has been in the financial planning business since among other roles mr evensky has served as chairman of the certified financial planner board of standards the organization that awards the cfp mark to planners we asked him to discuss with us the allocation his firm uses for moderate risk investors mr evensky often calls his firms model portfolios "boring " because he and the other planners advise a simple asset allocation model and dont move it around too much for a moderate risk investor he says the base allocation his company uses is about stocks exclusively through stock funds and in bond funds the companys aim is to get an average annual return of at least percentage points more than the inflation rate over the next five years he says with the potential loss not expected to exceed in any month period to build the moderate risk portfolio mr evensky says he uses a "core and satellite" approach about of the assets are invested in core stock funds which represent the broad market and whose allocation isnt likely to change for three to five years "the purpose of the core is to cost and tax efficiently buy the market " says mr evensky about of the portfolio is invested in satellite holdings funds that provide exposure to niche segments of the market these are essentially short term bets that mr evensky believes will deliver a high return over a month period or less these funds may have higher expense ratios and they may be tax inefficient volatile or generally higher in risk than the funds used for core holdings the idea is that net of expenses and taxes the satellite funds "will do two percentage points better than the broad market " says mr evensky he calls these funds "the alpha generator " meaning an investment that will generate excess return since the team at evensky &amp katz doesnt expect to move around the core holdings for three to five years any tactical bets on the market are executed through the satellite holdings for instance they bought matthews asia pacific fund in november and sold it in march during which it returned about on an annualized basis according to mr evensky "were prepared to sell get out and go back again using the tactical allocation " he says the model portfolio is tweaked for clients other holdings tax brackets and other factors here is how the firms current model portfolio for moderate risk breaks down core holdings most of the core stock funds track market indexes or are managed largely through computer programs that identify certain types of stocks not by stock pickers looking for great ideas for many years mr evensky used a mix of actively managed funds and index funds for core holdings but in he concluded that over the next years the u s market wouldnt deliver as strong a return as it had in the prior years so to get decent returns it was even more important to pay attention to the cost of funds his clients owned steering him more toward the low cost index world in many broad areas of the u s stock market mr evensky says that net of expenses and taxes "we dont think there are managers that are going to do better than the index " nearly a fourth of the portfolio is currently invested in ishares russell index etf an exchange traded fund that tracks the russell index which measures the performance of the largest u s publicly traded companies based on total market capitalization about is allocated to dfa us small cap value portfolio a small stock fund run by dimensional fund advisors inc dfa runs a variation of an index fund based on computerized screening of stocks that aims to identify groups of shares with certain risk and return metrics another is in ishares s&amp p midcap index a stock index of midsize companies for foreign investing mr evensky allocates about to julius baer international equity a fund that largely buys companies in developed countries it is run by a stock picker "we think that the manager can add value " he says the advisers pay particular attention to rebalancing "if you dont rebalance allocations become nonsense " he says the team sets rebalancing parameters for each fund for instance if the dfa small stock fund swells with gains the team will let it reach of the portfolio then cut it to mr evensky doesnt advise rebalancing too quickly because "you lose the momentum opportunity " also too much rebalancing can set off tax and transaction costs satellite holdings these holdings are assessed every month and changed frequently "thats where the best action is " mr evensky says currently the team is betting on ishares russell growth index etf an index of growth companies which are those whose earnings are expanding rapidly mr evensky believes growth companies are going to regain favor with investors though he has less confidence in them now he says as their performance lately has been relatively flat and their stock market comeback not as quick as his firm had expected in march evensky &amp katz cut the allocation to this fund to from since september mr evensky has been buying a fund that invests in short term bonds of emerging markets pimco developing local markets he says this is a play on currencies and a source for yield with the potential to gain from the improvement in the quality of many of these emerging market bonds a recent satellite addition is old mutual analytic defensive equity which uses mathematical models to buy stocks world wide while using derivatives like options to hedge its market risk "it doesnt fit any neat category " says mr evensky but he is convinced "it will generate that alpha for us " not all of the firms satellite bets pan out for nearly two years the model portfolio included a fund that bet against year u s treasury bonds expecting that the fund would gain as long term interest rates in the u s rise when interest rates rise existing bonds which are paying lower interest rates fall in value but long term rates havent risen as fast or as much as the team had expected so last month it decided to sell out of the fund "if there is substantive change we will revisit it " mr evensky says the team is still deciding where to put that money he says in the past mr evensky has experimented with several other kinds of funds within the satellites including a commodity oriented fund and one that invests in real estate investment trusts bonds "in general we are in fixed income to preserve capital we are in stocks to make money " he says almost three quarters of the fixed income allocation is in municipal bond funds as these provide tax advantages that are important for mr evenskys wealthy clientele the three municipal bond funds in the portfolio are of short and intermediate duration they are schroder short term municipal bond at schroder municipal bond at and thornburg limited term municipal at the remaining is assigned to pimco foreign bond fund u s dollar hedged ms anand is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau she can be reached at shefali anand wsj com
