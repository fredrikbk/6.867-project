muslim melting pot against the backdrop of civil war abraham lincoln stirred americans by appealing to their "better angels " now some of those angels appear in an unprecedented study about muslims in the united states and they may show us how to prevent civil war in europe "muslim americans " released by the pew research center contains moments of bad news for example one in four respondents under the age of accepts suicide bombing as a reformed minded muslim i say that honoring any religion of peace through violence is like preserving virginity through pre marital sex think about it but the pew report offers a lot more good news political islam has not caught on in america as it has in europe because most muslims in the u s are dare it be said treated with dignity the vast majority of those surveyed like their communities and describe their lives as "pretty happy" or "very happy " which means lobbyists do not speak for muslim americans when they cry that the u s hates islam in berlin recently an audience buzzed nervously when i suggested that europe can learn from america about integrating muslims afterwards several people confided to me that they know the u s is getting something right what is that something as i engage with young muslims on both sides of the atlantic i see three factors economics diversity and faith for plenty of muslims in the united states ambition and initiative pay off the pew survey reinforces this lesson telling us that of muslim americans believe most people in the u s "can make it if they are willing to work hard " meanwhile in europe young muslims face blatant discrimination in employment educational and social opportunities even when they are citizens many subsist on welfare which only gives them time to stew and surf the web for preachers who spew a rigid identity this is the path that led mohammed bouyeri to murder dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in much of america diversity is a reason to intermingle the pew study reveals that most muslims are close friends with non muslims in much of europe diversity has become an excuse to self segregate many of europes mosques and the muslims who attend them refuse to communicate in the language of their new surroundings as a result young muslim men drift away from moderate religious authorities and fall for online opportunists that is how mohammad sidique khan mastermind of the london transit bombers fell under the sway of "sheikh google " the collective nickname for islamist web sites to americans it is not the fact of having faith that invites scrutiny but what one is perceived to be doing with that faith western europeans still steeped in a backlash against the catholic church often show suspicion or outright contempt to people of faith such "secular fundamentalism" leads some muslims to believe that they will never be accepted by their adopted countries so why integrate small wonder that young muslims in western europe whisper to me "i wish i lived in the united states " the honesty doesnt end there muslim men in their twenties have complained to me that in an effort to appear sensitive europeans downplay shared values this confuses many muslim youth and creates a vacuum that radical clerics can exploit translation a common aspiration such as the american dream is crucial to giving muslims a sense of belonging to something larger and more dynamic than cultural enclaves but what about the patriot act and guantanamo bay the answer always comes back that these are unfortunate and unjust exceptions in america they say you can be more than a muslim you are a member of the wider public naive not according to the pew study more than half of muslims in the u s identify themselves as americans first easily eclipsing patriotism among muslims in germany spain or britain clearly the u s has retained its genius as a nation of immigrants to be sure there is a long way to go in giving non immigrant muslims especially african americans a sense of belonging most are not among the better educated wealthier and politically influential americans that so many south asian iranian and arab muslims are however that gap is the product of americas persistent racial battle it has almost nothing to do with a fear of islam for the all the slogans accusations and fulminations of the islam industrys lobbyists fear is not what mainstream americans feel about muslims just ask the of muslims who told pew that they have never been discriminated against in the u s europe take notes america take a break from self flagellation reformist muslims take your cue in the u s you have the possibility of a voice islams better angels depend on it ms manji a senior fellow at the european foundation for democracy is author of "the trouble with islam today a muslims call for reform in her faith" st martins see related letters "letters to the editor terrorism muslims should look within and not blame others" wsj june
