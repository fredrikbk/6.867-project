pipeline that originates in new jersey the anticipated explosion was supposed to have destroyed the airport terminal buildings and part of the surrounding area but aviation experts say the damage would have been much more limited the alleged plot didnt get past the planning stages and posed no threat to air safety or the public according to the fbi which led the month multiagency operation all four men are charged with conspiring to attack the airport one of the nations busiest according to the indictment the group seemed to have little financial or ideological backing the indictment indicates that while the group was reaching out to jam members in trinidad mr kadir a former member of guyanas parliament had decided to look for "contacts overseas" that might be willing to fund the plot some law enforcement officials said mr kadir may have been looking to jihadists in germany but gave no details counterterrorism officials have also focused on arab and muslim populations in latin

moved to make the plan operational allegedly by trying to buy guns from contacts not controlled by the fbi it wasnt immediately clear in this case why investigators decided to take down the jfk plot

it "one of the most chilling plots imaginable " michael balboni the deputy secretary for public safety for the state of new york said the decision was made to stop the plot before it matured further according to the indictment mr defreitas wanted to attack kennedy airport in the hope that it would be bigger than destruction of the world trade center on sept he believed the target to be especially symbolic because it was named in honor of the th president "anytime you hit kennedy it is the most hurtful thing to the united states if you hit that this whole country will be in mourning its like you can kill the man twice " the indictment quoted him as saying in a recorded conversation with an fbi informant
