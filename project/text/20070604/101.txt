sign up for the e mail here the annual group of eight summit is shaping up to be a battle for european hearts and minds with a disquietingly familiar rivalry president bush leaves this morning for a six day european trip scheduled around the summit of the leading industrial nations that kicks off wednesday in host country germany but he has been preceded by vladimir putins multinational media tour an offensive clearly aimed at winning over the mostly european nations caught between them there seems little coincidence in the white houses choice to sandwich the stop in germany between visits to the czech republic and poland which have agreed to accommodate the radar system and interceptor missiles of the missile defense shield mr bush wants to extend to europe his russian counterpart is clearly trying to portray that shield as the casus belli for a cold war renewal that he reluctantly feels he must confront putting aside debates over whether europe needs the shield iran the main threat cited by washington may or may not have the needed missile range but could develop it down the line the arsenal really in play here is rhetorical both russia and the u s have alienated europeans and want their support for the bush administration the trip offers an echo of the international debate preceding the invasion of iraq which itself doesnt figure largely on the g s agenda but is the elephant in the room coloring all u s relations these days with the rest of the world the czech and polish governments former soviet satellites anxious about russias petroleum fueled clout and aggressive willingness to use it are among the few firm european backers of a missile shield as the international herald tribune points out they are also "new europe" in the nomenclature employed by donald rumsfeld half of the european contingent of the g britain and italy also supported the iraq invasion but are now much closer to germany and france when it comes to climate change and other key g issues mr putin is courting the latter in an interview with le figaro the russian leader emphasized parallels with nicolas sarkozy saying that like the new french president he is a friend of the u s who simply wants to reinforce the international security system to that end russia needs to address the missile shield with reciprocal measures to "re establish equilibrium " an imbalance mr putin suggests that might be aimed at "impeding a rapprochement between russia and europe " does that mean a return to a time when russian missiles were pointing at western europe le figaro asks "yes " mr putin replies "we are now heading back to that period " speaking to the times of london mr putin goes so far that having "this system of missile defense on one side and the absence of this system on the other increases the possibility of unleashing a nuclear conflict " as the wall street journal notes missiles can be aimed and re aimed quickly making a retargeting toward western europe one with little practical impact that said no one wants nuclear tipped missiles aimed in their direction and if such posturing is the stick side of mr putins give and take with europe it could backfire especially at a time when old and new europeans are in sync when it comes to concerns about russias growing power over regional petroleum matters and declining respect for democratic and human rights principles a u s state department official tells the journal there is a significant if private consensus among europeans and americans about russia right now the u s and allied european governments are working closely together on iran but they are divided over one of the biggest items on the g agenda climate change which itself is increasingly seen as an issue vital to global security even tony blair the soon to be departing british prime minister and stalwart partner of mr bush is siding against the u s and with germany in seeking concrete limits on the emission of greenhouse gases as the financial times reports russia is vastly more integrated into the global economy than the u s s r ever was and there seems little danger that moscow and washington could return to a truly menacing cold war but political support for and against the missile defense like those on climate change will follow how much peoples in russia the u s and europe perceive themselves to be in danger and perception at the g summit will be everything deal gives palm cash apple veterans as apple prepares to launch the hyperly anticipated iphone on june as the company confirmed in television commercials

lake partners are now the lead bidders people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal the journal says the deal could still veer into the hands of rival suitor nortel networks but the new york times says the two private equity firms seem to have bested nortel and that a deal worth more than &# billion could be announced as early as today whichever buyer eventually wins the journal says "the apparent victory of a private equity buyer emphasizes the continued market power of buyout shops which are able to trump strategic buyers on deals by using cheap debt and reducing their historic investment return thresholds " on another front one that could mark one of the biggest private equity moves into the technology sector kohlberg kravis roberts the blackstone group and other suitors are courting cadence design systems one of the largest makers of the software used to design computer chips people close to the matter tell the times such technology firms have generally been avoided by private equity "because of its volatility and need for capital " the times notes "but as buyout firms have grown bolder and more flush with cash they may be betting that they can still wring out lucrative returns " made in the u s a but who cares nationalism may be on the rise in geopolitics but it isnt in branding at least for younger americans once upon a time ad age notes "it made sense to proudly announce a products country of origin in your advertising many car buyers were proud to buy american technofiles knew the best electronics equipment came from japan and people of a certain stripe will always argue that belgium makes the best beer " but a new study from anderson analytics suggests young consumers arent able to identify where their favorite brands originate and wouldnt care if they knew the magazine reports "being online transcends geography " says ted morris senior vice president for global alliances at brandintel "point of origin is becoming less relevant " for example the anderson survey of college students found just knew nokia is finnish and that guessed the brand was japanese fewer than know the countries of lego lg samsung and adidas most of these were deemed american and while correctly guessed ikea is swedish nearly guessed it was from the u s "for the most part " andersons tom anderson says "this next generation of educated american consumers either have no clue where the brands they use come from or simply assume everything comes from the united states japan or germany " also of note new york times three months after the start
