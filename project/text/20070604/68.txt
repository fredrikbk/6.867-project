murdoch may make concessions up to a limit in dow jones talks news corp isnt willing to let bancrofts control editorial oversight board as representatives of both companies prepare to meet today news corp is willing to go further than it has gone before in acceding to tighter editorial independence controls to win dow jones &amp co people close to news corp said yesterday but rupert murdoch chairman and chief executive of news corp made clear in an interview friday that he isnt willing to yield to what may be a key demand from the bancroft family dow joness controlling shareholder that the family control any editorial oversight board created to protect dow joness editorial independence in the event of a deal such a board should comprise "people with absolutely no business connections to me nor the family " mr murdoch said adding that the family "cant sell dow jones and keep it" by joining a newly created board "i cant put down &# billion of my shareholders money and not be able to run the business " mr murdoch said he stressed that he has "no plans to change anything" on the editorial or news sides of the paper the issue of editorial independence for dow jones and its flagship title the wall street journal will be paramount when mr murdoch and his second oldest son james murdoch the ceo of news corp affiliate company british sky broadcasting meet today with three members of the bancroft family the meeting is the first since news corp submitted an offer of &# a share or &# billion for dow jones in april a majority of the family initially said they werent interested but thursday shifted position acknowledging a willingness to talk to news corp and consider any other suitors as well mr murdochs guarantees of editorial independence are meant to convince the bancrofts to sell the company without feeling they have betrayed the familys generations old commitment to the integrity of the journalistic enterprise some family members have made clear they dont approve of mr murdochs approach to newspapers they are considering a sale only because they feel dow jones cant operate effectively on its own and no third parties have appeared to compete with mr murdochs bid mr murdoch has suggested creating an independent board like that which is supposed to guarantee the editorial independence of the times of london and the sunday times which he acquired in that board must approve appointment of editors some critics have said the board has proved ineffective failing to stop mr murdoch from forcing out editors he didnt like most famously harold evans in the bancroft family isnt expected to try to re create the times board according to people familiar with the discussions among mr murdoch and his advisers jpmorgan chase centerview partners allen &amp co and law firm skadden arps slate meagher &amp flom llp there is a growing view that the "times of london" structure wont be adequate to convince the bancrofts to sell news corp would be willing to explore a structure similar to that historically used by reuters plc according to people close to news corp this arrangement gave the reuters trustees veto power over any deal something they will maintain in the newly combined thomson reuters company the arrangement also granted trustees broad rights and privileges no shareholder could own more than of the companys shares without the trustees consent as part of the deal with thomson corp reuters trustees must be "consulted" before any editor in chief of reuters is appointed or removed the meeting which will be held at the offices of family legal adviser wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz is designed as part social gathering and part business meeting according to people familiar with the plans one of its main goals is to get the three bancroft family members attending the meeting christopher bancroft leslie hill and elizabeth steele who are also dow jones directors comfortable with mr murdoch and his family the bancrofts will be accompanied by dow jones chairman m peter mcpherson family trustee michael elefante and attorney martin lipton who is advising the family also attending on the news corp side will be chief financial officer david devoe and general counsel lawrence jacobs at the meeting mr murdoch is expected to do more listening than talking people close to news corp said to prepare for todays meeting mr elefante held two conference calls with the bancroft family directors and representatives of dow joness news operations on thursday night and friday afternoon the calls were set up at the familys request to get guidance on how best to preserve dow joness journalistic integrity and included representatives from the companys news divisions including marcus brauchli the journals new managing editor l gordon crovitz the journals publisher paul gigot editorial page editor of the journal clare hart president of dow joness enterprise media group which includes dow jones newswires and factiva an aggregator of news and information neal lipschutz managing editor of dow jones newswires and john wilcox president of dow joness community media group which comprises the ottaway group of local newspapers several news executives have prepared memos for the family to give them guidance in their negotiations with mr murdoch according to people familiar with the matter mr brauchli said in a statement "no asset is more important to the journal than its editorial independence including the freedom to decide what and whom the journal covers how and in what media and with what resources our integrity is the wellspring of our value to readers and were grateful that both the bancroft family and rupert murdoch appreciate this and are focused on preserving it i will do everything i can to ensure that the journals news department remains independent and vital " some of the advice given to the family went beyond simply protecting the journal and sought to protect the wall street journal brand by limiting how mr murdoch could use the journal name these people said the journal already has strict controls over the use of its name with licensees that could be a sticking point with mr murdoch who is expected to want to use the journals name to promote his other media properties martin peers and steve stecklow contributed to this article
