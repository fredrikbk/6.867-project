making perfect rice the japanese way can cost big bucks secret involves a vacuum pressure and a sprinkling of toshibas diamond dust more than four years ago japans toshiba corp began working on a top secret electronic device the &# machine which some say resembles a tiny spaceship had a powerful vacuum pump to suck all the air out it was designed to withstand pounds of pressure and it made use of silver and powdered diamonds production of the contraption which takes about people to assemble started last year toshibas creation is the "vacuum pressure cooker " the companys most expensive rice cooker ever the pressure makes it possible to boil the water in the cooker at a higher temperature thus making for fatter shinier and sweeter grains of rice the air sucking filter creates a vacuum causing the rice to absorb water more quickly while it soaks the silver and diamond dust are used to coat the cooking vessel so as to distribute heat evenly so every grain of rice has the same texture "it was a lot of work " says noriko saito one of toshibas chief rice cooker developers she test cooked as much as pounds of rice a week to determine the best cooking process using both the vacuum and pressure technologies such an all out effort might seem bizarre for something as mundane as cooking rice which is easy to do in a pot on the stove or in a &# electric rice cooker of the sort used throughout the world but many japanese who are fiercely proud to be obsessed with rice wouldnt dream of anything so simple after all theyre connoisseurs while japan imports a small percentage of rice from countries such as the u s and china most of it is processed into foods like rice crackers and soybean paste for soup the vast majority of the rice that is eaten is grown in japan which has about different varieties of rice some with romantic names like "dream of stars" and "love at first sight " rice aficionados subscribe to rice of the month clubs and are willing to pay about &# a pound for premium rice japanese consumers spend an average of &# for their rice cookers the highest price in the world to many japanese who consume nearly five times as much rice as americans do and who consider it the most important part of a meal it makes sense to go to great lengths to bring out the flavor of rice good rice cooked properly is sweet shiny and fragrant experts say and has just the right amount of stickiness to clump together between chopsticks "the ideal rice can be enjoyed first with the eyes then with the nose and finally with the tongue as the sweetness spreads upon chewing " says toyozou nishijima a certified rice expert in japan now as japans economy improves and a boom in health consciousness draws more favorable attention to traditional rice centered meals more japanese consumers are willing to pay as much as &# for ultra high end rice cookers in a &# million a year market that has remained mostly flat for years high end rice cookers helped increase total rice cooker sales by last year according to the japan electrical manufacturers association manufacturers make these rice cookers only for the japanese market because they say very few people outside of japan appreciate the taste of plain white rice enough to pay such high prices matsushita electric industrial co japans largest rice cooker maker in revenue touts a &# rice cooker that promises to give rice exactly times as much oligosaccharide a kind of sugar as its previous models it uses a two step soaking process and a steam function hitachi ltd s &# model has a teflon coated stainless bowl with gold flecks on the inside to seal in the heat and make extra sweet rice zojirushi corp put artificial intelligence technology into its rice cooker to adjust the cooking process automatically according to seasonal differences in air and water temperature toshibas high end rice cooker which is available in two sizes has sold more than since its launch in september making it the best seller in the super expensive category according to an estimate by gfk marketing services ltd which tracks such data one recent convert is yuki ando a year old housewife in western japan ms ando bought toshibas vacuum pressure device in december after her husband complained that her old rice cooker which itself had cost &# made the rice taste dry even a discounted price of &# gave ms ando pause but she took the plunge because she knew she would be using the cooker every day one favorite feature the ability to keep rice warm in the pot for hours in a vacuum that preserves flavor "im not exaggerating the rice was shiny standing upright and fluffy " says ms ando "my husband who is particularly picky about rice has never complained " the latest rash of technology is a bit much for mr nishijima the rice expert "just because you pay yen about &# or yen doesnt mean that theres a drastic change in taste " says mr nishijima who adds that good rice can be made with the simplest of rice cookers if it is to be eaten right away he thinks consumers might be too susceptible to hype "it almost seems like anything is ok as long as its expensive " he says still the race for incremental improvements in rice cooking is a serious business for companies like toshiba the company struggled with making the combination of pressure and vacuum technologies work because the two opposing forces put such a strain on the rice cooker that the lid would warp or crack it wasnt until six months before launch that the company came up with a solution a heavy steel frame for the lid for the past years ms saito the rice cooker developer has been devoted to rice cookers and testing batches of rice the year old sniffs each batch she makes for sweetness checks its appearance for shine and fluffiness and then cuts into it with a scoop to make sure the texture is the same all the way down to the bottom of the bowl "if the rice is cooked badly " ms saito says "you might feel resistance or mushiness when you insert the rice scoop but if its cooked well it goes in very smoothly " the latest rice cookers have come a long way since toshiba in sold the worlds first automatic electric rice cooker and freed japanese housewives from having to cook their rice in heavy pots on wood fire stoves the first machine simply had a heating element beneath the bowl in which the rice cooked since then rice cooker manufacturers have improved the cooking process employing everything from a small computer chip induction heating coils around the bowl to make the rice cook evenly and most recently pressure technology to make the rice more moist and fluffy while toshibas rice cooker has been the best selling in the high end category it was actually one persistent developer at mitsubishi electric corp who triggered the race for upscale rice cookers with a &# model with an inner cooking bowl made of graphite which heats up quickly and evenly ideal qualities for making rice uniformly fluffy but it was also fragile and porous it took mitsubishi two years to develop a bowl that was sturdy enough and the bowl is still so difficult to make that the company can only make of them a day mitsubishi has sold more than of the rice cookers since they went on sale in march twice as many as it had expected toshibas ms saito says mitsubishis initial success was encouraging for the entire industry "we only put so much money into research and development if rice cookers cant sell for more than yen " or about &# says ms saito who believes theres still room for improvements "but if we know that consumers will pay yen &# it changes the picture " miho inada contributed to this article
