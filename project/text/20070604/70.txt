nokia tries to answer the call of design again copenhagen in the s nokia corp transformed the cellphone from a clunky gizmo to a fashion item but in recent years in design it has lagged behind rivals such as motorola inc and its trend setting razr now nokia is going to painstaking lengths to produce new phones with style nokia is pinning its hopes on the nokia classic which the company says is one of its five key products this year the worlds largest cellphone maker hopes the phone which it expects to go on sale later this year in many markets globally but not the u s will be an important weapon in its battle to reclaim the title as king of design from a host of contenders including motorola samsung electronics co and sony ericsson a joint venture between sony corp and telefon ab l m ericsson meanwhile the entrance of apple inc s high end iphone with its well known brand and easy to use software has further put pressure on nokia the effort that nokia put into the phone reflects the increasingly competitive world facing cellphone makers as their main markets are saturated with people who already own handsets phone makers make difficult trade offs between design and function agonizing over the smallest details in hope of winning over customers who have an ever expanding array of choices for months a nokia design team here fretted should it be metal or plastic silver or black could they make it even slimmer for example to make the classic a fraction of a millimeter thinner nokias design team ordered its suppliers to build a new antenna and spent several weeks doing additional tests "slimness is key " says christian riise years old a nokia product manager who shepherded the phone one of the first handset makers to grasp the importance of design in the s nokia based in espoo finland has stumbled in recent years by missing several important trends including clamshell shaped phones sharp color screens and most recently thin phones that opened the way for competitors the companys products while reliable and easy to use remain in many cases bulky and boring looking analysts and customers say fixing its design organization is a top priority of nokias chief executive olli pekka kallasvuo who took the helm last summer "to some extent we lost the quality of design " says kai oistamoe head of nokias mobile phone unit that makes low and mid priced handsets nokia had placed more emphasis on the technical features of the phones and ensuring they were easy to use around august nokia assigned mr riise to produce a new mid priced phone nokia has about a dozen profiles that it uses to identify and group customers including "family providers" who just want phones for calling and "technology leaders" who want the latest bells and whistles mr riise teamed up with marketing specialist dominic fried booth to identify the target audience as "life builders " young professionals launching their careers and family life the group is important nokia executives say because it influences the broader population with its purchasing choices from phones to fashion and cars according to nokias consumer studies this group is looking for a stylish phone with decent features like long battery life but isnt necessarily looking for all the latest bells and whistles for the nokia classic mr riise decided several features were particularly important the phone should be slim and work with high speed wireless networks known as g nokia also set a price of about &# before taxes and subsidies for the phone mr riise brainstormed with designer anton fahlgren and technical expert mads lindborg about how the phone should look and which technical features it should include the team pored over sketches and made wax models to gauge different dimensions and proportions mr fahlgren dismissed one design saying it had too big a "forehead " that is the space between the screen and the top of the phone a big forehead leaves less room for the key pad and can make a phone look dated "it gives a very different expression to the phone " says mr fahlgren who wears black skinny jeans and his dark hair in a trendy shaggy style early on mr riise gave up his plan to include a video calling feature because the video camera lens would add a couple of millimeters to the length of the phone the team worried the phone could go from slim to flimsy one technical expert suggested using an aluminum tube for the outer casing it would be sturdier than a traditional phones plastic front and back and the designers loved the metals distinctive look and feel mr lindborg however pushed back putting metal in phones is difficult because it blocks the signals between the network and the handset so mr riise settled on a compromise he would keep metal for the upper half that consumers handle most but put plastic on the lower half of the phone and to help reception he would move the antenna to the bottom plastic part instead of the typical top position the plan required reworking the guts of the phone because moving any of the roughly components in a cellphone particularly major ones such as the battery antenna or screen can cause reception difficulties by the beginning of after months of meeting daily and sometimes several times a day the team had a mock up of a silver colored millimeter thick phone during january and february of that year nokia showed the phone to focus groups in london boston mumbai moscow bangkok and shanghai nokia plans to sell the phone in markets around the world including europe asia and latin america but not in the u s because much of the u s uses different cellphone standards among other issues the reaction generally was positive but some consumers particularly women said the silver color made the phone feel sober and "a little bit too cold " mr riise says they ended up ditching silver for black metal on portions of the phone but added accents such as a silver border around the screen the team also added features like a tiny bar to the bottom of each key on the dial pad in an effort to make the small keys easier to use mr riise ordered up the smaller antenna to help slim the phone down to millimeters thick he asked his team how to make the phone even slimmer one technician suggested a smaller battery to shrink the phone to millimeters but it would cut the battery life by about "i said that is simply way too big a compromise " mr riise says presenting the work to senior executives in what nokia calls "sanity check" presentations mr riise asked for and got a few weeks extension to continue testing the antenna the risk of not moving fast enough is that a product "is outdated before it hits the market " says mr riise but "the absolutely worst thing to do is to rush a product out and it be a failure " after more tests the team signed off on the nokia classic the number identifies it as part of a high profile nokia line and classic indicates it is a modern twist on its traditional design nokia says nokias often dry names contrast to some rivals such as motorolas razr line of phones or the shine and chocolate phones from lg electronics inc a hot design can make a companys fortunes just as motorola staged a comeback on the razr and more recently has floundered as it has struggled to come up with a successor phone while the classic wont be available in the u s nokia has been increasing its efforts to design cellphones that cater to the tastes of u s consumers who tend to prefer clamshell shaped and slider phones over candy bar shaped phones which are popular elsewhere in the world nokia recently carved out a team at its san diego research facility dedicated to developing phones specifically for the u s market which the handset maker says it typically hasnt done innovations used in the process would likely be applied in developing other phones nokia trumpeted the classic to analysts last week carolina milanesi an analyst at research firm gartner inc likes the new phone because it provides a much needed boost to nokias portfolio it is slim and it has solid technical features but after all that she says simply "as far as design is concerned it is still quite conservative "
