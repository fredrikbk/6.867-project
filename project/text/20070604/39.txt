hard drive how h p reclaimed its pc lead over dell shifting battlefield to stores was key help from vera wang cupertino calif hewlett packard co is riding high today as the worlds undisputed leader of personal computer sales but thats not how todd bradley found things when he joined the company in dell inc was the top pc maker that year when h p chief executive mark hurd hired mr bradley to run the companys pc business h ps pc operations were barely profitable morale was foundering and some investors were suggesting h p get out of pcs altogether h p owes that remarkable turnabout to something mr bradley concluded within weeks of arriving at the palo alto calif company h p was fighting on the wrong battlefield h p was concentrating its resources to fight dell where dell was strong in direct sales over the internet and phone instead he decided h p should focus on its strength retail stores where dell had no presence at all h p was neglecting that advantage mr bradley found as he visited retailers and h p factories hearing complaints about late or incomplete deliveries he worked hard to fix the logistical snafus and build better relations with the retailers helping h p surpass dell in world sales late last year for the first time since now dell is trying to shift the battlefield again on may dell inked its first major deal to sell through a retailer wal mart stores inc since the company pulled out of stores in and said the deal was just the first step of a broader retail push dell said it would offer two desktop pcs in more than wal mart and sams club stores starting june dells move into stores shows how swiftly strategies can evolve in the pc business these days amid relentless competition and fast changing consumer tastes pc makers have had to learn to rapidly shift their distribution strategies dells latest tack could spell trouble for h p as retail shelf space is tight and retailers often like to play vendors off each other to get better margins for themselves h p also faces u s marketing pushes from other retail pc rivals such as sony corp gateway inc and acer inc still mr bradley has carved out a big advantage by emphasizing store sales just as pc growth was moving from corporate desktops to personal laptops which consumers like to test out in person the year old executive previously helped lift another technology company out of the doldrums by surfing a market trend as chief executive of palmone inc he moved the companys emphasis from its widely copied palm data devices to smart phones just as those sales took off for h p mr bradley laid out a day road map to help make the companys deliveries to stores reliable again he cozied up more to retailers and pushed attention getting products such as touch screen pcs that would show well in store displays and command a premium price he pushed to design exclusive pcs for specific retailers like fashion designers making exclusive lines of clothing to help stores differentiate the computers they sell from those of their competitors h p commands about of pc sales in u s stores and has increased its leading share in the growing laptop business in the past two years according to npd group inc last year h p rose spots on a list circuit city stores inc keeps of its most reliable vendors grabbing the top spot among pc makers "our relationship with h p has improved significantly since " says john kelly a circuit city senior vice president h ps operating margins on its pcs rose to in its fiscal second quarter from a year earlier dells margin while still bigger than that of h p dipped slightly to in its fiscal first quarter from a year earlier h ps stock has doubled in the past two years while dells is down about over the same period all of this has forced round rock texas based dell into an unfamiliar underdog role in the first quarter h ps global pc market share jumped to from a year ago while dells share slipped to from according to market researcher gartner inc a spokesman for dell bob pearson said the company would be aggressively taking on h p and other competitors in every sales venue "the bell for round two is about to ring and it will be heard directly and indirectly in all distribution channels " he said in an email on thursday dell announced its first layoffs since in its effort to increase profits for years h p tried to copy dells approach under former ceo carly fiorina h p slashed its pc prices but that landed it with deep losses then it hacked at its own costs by laying off thousands of workers in order to compete with dells low cost structure thats how mr bradley found things when h ps new ceo mr hurd hired him in june to fix the pc operations mr bradley the first senior executive that mr hurd recruited from outside was known at palmone as detail oriented and a stickler for efficiency a reputation mr hurd shares in some ways mr bradley faced a similar situation at palmone there he helped sort through too many confusing models of similar products and trimmed bloated inventory in the companys supply chain according to people who worked with him palmone had just come off of several good years during the tech bubble where demand was high and the company faced little competition after the bubble burst mr bradley helped cut costs the executive also likes to have fun hes known widely around palmone for setting up a cubicle mini golf game around the office helping to get people from different departments talking to each other hes so engaged in the san francisco giants and local theater that he tried commuting around miles to h ps pc group offices in cupertino from a condo in san franciscos trendy soma district but recently gave up the long trip and bought a house closer by in palo alto mr bradley began refocusing on retail within weeks of joining h p in october mr bradley toured h ps manufacturing sites in europe and asia he found the factories had multiple hubs for collecting components and that manufacturing engineering and operations teams didnt communicate frequently enough the resulting logistics problems made h p often deliver late or partial pc orders to stores mr bradley concluded he learned the pc group had no marketing of its own the profitable printer division had charge of consumer marketing and advertising for pcs a relic of the companys structure under ms fiorina so mr bradley started forming his own marketing group meanwhile he saw internal h p research showed of pc buyers had no preference for whether they bought computers online or in stores mr bradley decided h p needed to convince more shoppers that retail was the better choice pcs "arent just a commodity that you run out and buy on the internet " he says "people are going to want to touch it and feel it and understand how it connects " mr bradley approved a new pc ad campaign aimed at consumers unlike previous h p ads that simply listed a pcs technical product features next to the products price the new "the computer is personal again" campaign featured celebrities such as hip hop mogul jay z and fashion designer vera wang talking about what they use their computers for dell had thrived largely by shipping desktop computers with customized components which clients can choose from its web site but that process was often confusing for individual consumers who represented the potential growth in the market meanwhile a drive toward bigger and more powerful laptops in place of desktops made features such as weight size keyboard feel and screen brightness just as important in making purchases as many internal components according to npd group of pcs sold to consumers in the first quarter were bought in a store up from nearly two years ago in january mr bradley met with mr hurd and h ps board to lay out a broad plan that included increased marketing of the h p brand within retail outlets pumping new pcs with fresh designs such as imprinted decorations into stores and getting deliveries to clients on time by cleaning up the supply chain last year h p spent of its u s marketing funds on merchandising and promotions in stores up from in the companys online advertisements now always include a message to "visit your local retailer " something it had done inconsistently in the past meanwhile mr bradley revamped h ps pc product lineup though the company spends &# billion on research and development projects a year little of that was leading to products for mr bradleys group so in november mr bradley brought in the chief technology officer of h ps wireless business phil mckinney to identify promising projects in h p labs and get them into retail stores mr mckinney found a model that combined a cpu and monitor into one unit somewhat like recent apple inc designs he also adapted some new touch screen software from h p labs for the machine making a one piece unit meant to be used in family rooms or kitchens as a pc with a touch screen calendar and message board h p says demand for the "touchsmart pc" has surpassed its internal sales forecasts since it was introduced in january and it sells at &# about three times the average desktop pc price the company declined to release sales figures when best buy co approached h p about making a new notebook exclusively for the richfield minn store chain last year mr bradley jumped at the offer h p design engineers began working closely with best buy and the two companies ultimately created a white and silver notebook computer the soft colors aimed at attracting female customers best buy says best buy featured the machine priced at &# on the cover of its sunday newspaper inserts and says it ended up as one of its top selling notebooks priced above &# during the holiday season "h p dedicated a good amount of resources " says jason bonfig a best buy executive in charge of notebooks at h p as at palmone mr bradley instituted weekly progress reports to track operations and find fixes for instance he demanded weekly rundowns of notebook computer deliveries to u s stores down to the hour they arrived the reports allowed mr bradley to see where bottlenecks were and whom to blame he set up a weekly call between employees ordering parts and employees taking pc orders and updated the software that helps the company forecast supply and demand globally so the company could speed up or slow down manufacturing of certain models mr bradley pushed to find ways to consolidate h ps pc manufacturing plants by closing seven plants leaving h p reduced the time and cost of building pcs helping to improve its operating margins the company says the rate of on time deliveries rose in the companys fiscal year ended oct the company says but declined to give details steven giblin merchandise manager for j&amp r music &amp computer world in new york says he previously never knew when h ps deliveries would show up at his stores and what would be in them now an h p representative calls him weekly to exchange information on j&amp rs sales and h ps available products and to adjust orders j&amp r gets h ps deliveries punctually he adds theyve done a "pretty good job in communicating " mr giblin says mr bradleys shifting of the battlefield has been met with some resistance when he launched the "personal" pc ad campaign he got phone calls and emails from alarmed h p employees who complained that that the message was too focused on consumer pcs ignoring the corporate business one engineer griped the campaign was too loud for h ps conservative image says a marketing executive mr bradley says he shrugged off the criticism "i wasnt holding an election " says the executive for direct pc sales where dell remains dominant mr bradley reviewed customer survey data that showed h p had too many pc models on its web site and reduced the number to from in january h p cut the time it takes to reach a sales rep by phone to seconds from seconds h p increased its share of direct pc sales world wide to in the first quarter from a year ago according to gartner dells share dipped to from mr bradley is now pushing his teams to work with retailers to display h p products such as wireless tvs alongside its pcs to show the devices working together and stimulate more sales mr bradley also is meeting with retailers and resellers in india and china in an effort to expand h ps retail shelf space outside of the u s dell hasnt stayed on the sidelines dell launched its own ad campaign to remind consumers of the benefits of customizing computers in july dell also opened its first retail store in a dallas mall acknowledging that some customers prefer to see the pcs before buying dell has described performance of the dallas store as "good " but declined to elaborate in april it scrapped plans to open an additional store in new york a spokesman said the company has no current plans to open other stores
