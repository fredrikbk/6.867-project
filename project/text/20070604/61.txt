lifelines husband wife work part time to share child care duties online edition lifelines looks at successful strategies for managing work life problems solving the child care dilemma when your household needs two incomes can be a headache and a heartache for parents for the past three and a half years mark and kimberly gavagan both years old of mendham n j have pursued a divide and conquer strategy both have cut back to part time work so each parent can care for audrey and sophie while the other is at work mr gavagan works three days a week as an independent stock trader and entrepreneur kimberly works two days in the office and the equivalent of a third day at home for an employee communications firm their story shows the ups and downs of sharing work family duties and the surprising benefits it can bring here they take turns telling their tale the problem mark "when kimberly was pregnant with audrey in we had a lot of stress as we tried to figure out what to do i didnt want to have to go work at a full time corporate job to support the family but i didnt want to be a full time parent kim didnt want to work full time either we rethought it again and again " the solution kimberly "having each of us work part time was marks idea i liked the idea but i was skeptical the biggest obstacle was how am i going to convince my company " alison davis of davis &amp co a employee glen rock n j employee communications firm and kimberlys boss of years "we immediately said were going to try to make this work because shes such a valuable asset to the company " kimberly "also i was concerned about whether mark would really want to take care of an infant he hesitated he said well well see ill do my best " mark "the first days kim went back to work after her first maternity leave were really tough id changed a million diapers and had done each piece of child care by myself but when youre alone its different i phoned kim a lot about things like heating the bottle "i still look back on one day with horror i refer to it as the brownout the day of the exploding diaper audrey was in her crib and her diaper had exploded all over everything when i walked in the room i thought we may have to move to get away from this fatherhood has brought me some of the longest days and the shortest years of my life " kimberly "it was hard to share responsibility for audrey at first i had to let go of this pressure we face in our society for our parenting to be perfect mark would never get audrey dressed id come home and hed say oh we went to visit my mother and audrey was still in her pajamas i said to myself ok you have to let go she got her feedings and diaper changings on time and he was playing and engaged with her i trusted mark on those things and audrey certainly isnt any worse for it today " mark "kim really has maintained control on child care issues she has read all the books and has knowledge i just dont have but we have similar philosophies most days we go for a walk together with the kids in a stroller and talk about whats going on with her at work with me with the kids so were connected "kim is making more than half our household income right now the rest comes from my work and income on our investments i made good money as a day trader in the late s but changes in the financial markets have reduced those opportunities now i trade one or two days a week and pursue entrepreneurial ventures in film production fund raising strategies and internet marketing " a business associate of marks celine rattray of plum pictures a manhattan film production company says she wasnt surprised to learn of his nontraditional fathering setup which she calls "quite inspiring " mr gavagan who partnered with plum as executive producer of a documentary is "not bound up" by conventional thinking ms rattray says but is "very much driven by his passions and interest " "but even though kim and i have each been the primary breadwinner at no time has either of us ever said look im the breadwinner here and were going to do what i want were a team i give her a ton of credit im sure shed like to work a little less one of our goals is to get to that point where she can " the downside mark "to do this you have to avoid consumer debt beyond a modest mortgage or education loan and keep overhead low also sometimes its frustrating not to have more time to spend on my business " kimberly "our income is adequate but it doesnt leave a lot of room for extra things we typically dont take vacations were both driving year old cars "the hardest thing for me is the constant juggling act i have clients and deadlines if audrey is at preschool and sophie is taking a nap ill sit down and do some work after she wakes up i sit down on the floor and read a few stories then check e mail omigosh heres an e mail from a client and i have to switch gears from the cat in the hat to a big project while i have two little ones tugging on my sleeve saying read me a book after theyre both asleep at p m i go back to work for hours "in some ways this has held me back on the job its difficult to run projects as a part time employee so now i support my peers but keeping a toe in the water is better than not working at all its a fine tradeoff for now " the outcome mark "some days ill be sitting with audrey and sophie reading a book and audrey just turns and faces me and snuggles into my side i feel like my heart is going to leap out of my chest these few wonderful years where we are the center of their universe can never be replaced "with kim sharing child care has brought us a lot closer i have a full appreciation for what its like to be that full time parent and i have a full appreciation for what its like to go to work all day and then come home to family responsibilities " kimberly "i know families where the husband walks in the door at p m looks around and says why is the house such a mess why is dinner not ready what did you do all day theres a gap in his understanding but mark and i respect each others roles very much write to sue shellenbarger at sue shellenbarger wsj com
