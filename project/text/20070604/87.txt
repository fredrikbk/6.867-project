politics &amp economics thompsons first test raising funds fast after a late start campaign targets web fence sitters as a late entry into the crowded expensive presidential campaign fred thompsons first big test of viability will be his ability to raise money quickly a major part of the former tennessee senators strategy is a heavy reliance on the internet to get his message out and to raise funds he is also trying to tap into the large number of well heeled republican financiers who have yet to commit to a hopeful amid widespread disaffection among party loyalists with the current field yet a late start and signs that mr thompson may adopt an unconventional campaign style limiting in person appearances by making extensive use of blogging and online video could crimp the television actors ability to raise money over the long haul he has suggested he isnt enamored of leaving his family for long stretches of campaign travel the question is whether an internet campaign will help him raise money quickly or leave big donors cold signs suggest that he wont have trouble in the early going in a conference call tuesday with more than supporters mr thompson flogged each to raise a quick &# by early this week to become "first day founders " participants said each can presumably meet his or her goal by tapping friends to make a maximum &# individual donation if they do mr thompson will start his campaign with a quick display of fund raising prowess and about &# million on hand "i see the indecision and noncommitted people on the republican side who are yearning for a conservative " said mack mattingly a former georgia senator who was on the conference call and committed to raising the cash "i dont see raising money as a big problem even bad candidates are raising money " mr mattingly said the quick money infusion into mr thompsons campaign is calculated to be "part of the splash" the "law and order" star makes this week in a race where polls have already placed even his prospective candidacy toward the top of the pack mr thompsons ability to raise money for a presidential campaign formally began friday with official creation of an exploratory committee in nashville mr thompson will have a boost from tennessee republican rep zach wamp who says his four month old draft thompson web site has collected the email addresses of people who have signaled they are willing to help a thompson campaign mr wamp was also on the fund raising call mr thompson also comes late to other factors of the campaign such as building organizations in crucial states and establishing name recognition among voters but the presidential race is marked in the early going by the tidal wave of money that has already flowed to the top candidates in both campaigns the republican money leader so far is former massachusetts gov mitt romney whose first quarter fund raising total stood at &# million rudy giuliani and john mccain raised &# million and &# million respectively delaying his candidacy cost mr thompson support of two prominent tennessee fund raisers chip saltsman former state party chairman who raised more than &# for president bushs race and ted welch a nashville developer who raised more than &# for mr bushs last campaign becoming a bush "ranger " mr saltsman has committed to longshot arkansas ex gov mike huckabee mr welch said he would have been happy to raise funds for mr thompson but has already committed to mr romney brad freeman a los angeles investment banker and bush ranger who is raising money for mitt romney said most of his friends have already committed he points to mr welch as a symbol of the difficulties that may face mr thompson "even his natural constituency is spoken for " mr freeman said "i think hell find it tough sledding a lot of ships have sailed " and in a hint of what could become a problem with an internet heavy strategy mr wamp said mr thompson fielded a number of questions about his platform in the conference call last week on positions that the candidate has already sketched out "the money people arent bloggers and activists so they didnt know fred has spoken extensively about many of these issues such as immigration " mr wamp said "so i broke in and told them its all collected on our web site and they should go and take a look " few republican operatives doubt mr thompson can raise the initial &# million he seeks as one major party fund raiser noted "you dont put out a figure like that unless youre pretty sure you can get there " moreover the fund raiser said four large states that
