chips ahoy a normally obscure federal agency may soon ban the import of an entire class of next generation mobile phones verizon which is not a party to the dispute but would be its chief victim if the ban is enforced has estimated the losses to be in the billions of dollars the case is one front in a blood feud between qualcomm and broadcom two u s semiconductor firms that both outsource nearly all manufacturing to chip foundries in asia the two have been clawing like ultimate fighters over patents that each says the other is violating last week broadcom won a round in a u s federal court when a jury ruled that qualcomm has been infringing several broadcom patents but as in most patent cases slogging through federal courts this litigation is far from over enter the international trade commission the independent federal agency budget &# million has the power dating back to the smoot hawley tariff to bar the import of products that it deems to infringe the patent of an american patent holder the nice thing about the itc if you want to terrorize a competitor is that it works fast doesnt wait for a finding of infringement from a federal court and can issue a permanent import ban for some products an import ban is equivalent to removing them from the market because nobody makes them in the u s this is the case with the qualcomm chips that broadcom wants barred after we wrote about this case last year the administrative law judge overseeing the case ruled against a ban citing the widespread economic disruption it would cause to non parties like verizon that seems to have put the itcs staff in a snit itc chairman david pearson likes to say that the increasing number of patent cases coming before the agency shows that its process "adds value " when he went before congress this year seeking more money for his agency he cited the broadcom qualcomm case as well as pointing out how fast the itc caseload has grown a bureaucracy doesnt make a name for itself by not taking action the parties for which mr pearson takes pride in "adding value" might not see the itcs services as so valuable if it refused to ban imports in a high profile case thus a refusal to ban qualcomms chips might dent the rising caseload mr pearson is touting on capitol hill as a reason to pump up his budget the itcs six commissioners recently postponed a decision in the broadcom case until this thursday they can accept the administrative law judges finding that a ban on qualcomms cell phone chips would cause undue economic disruption or they can overrule the judge and issue the ban anyway if the itc bans qualcomms chips president bush has days to overrule the commission a decision he has delegated to u s trade representative susan schwab if the itc determines that its bureaucratic ambitions outweigh the public interest here it will fall to ms schwab to impose some adult supervision the business world is paying close attention to the precedent that a ban could set even as the itc staff covets vast new leverage over american industry lets hope the bush administration is watching with equal care see related letter "letters to the editor pervasive infringement against broadcom patents" wsj june see related letter "letters to the editor itcs need to protect intellectual property" wsj june
