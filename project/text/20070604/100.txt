the evening wrap guantanamos fine print online edition after the supreme court struck down its tribunal system for terrorism suspects the bush administration believed it had forged an acceptable alternative but a seemingly small matter of language today emerged to threaten the latest effort to bring prisoners at guantanamo bay cuba to justice the military judge hearing the case of canadian born omar ahmed khadr said that he had no choice but to dismiss the case because the detainee who was just years old in july when he allegedly threw a hand grenade that killed an army soldier didnt meet the definition of those subject to such trials under the military commissions act that measure approved by congress and signed by president bush after the supreme court declared the administrations initial military tribunal system to be unconstitutional said only that those classified as "unlawful enemy combatants" could be moved through the tribunal system but army col peter brownback said that a military review panel had classified mr khadr only as an "enemy combatant " and that because the law had made a distinction between lawful and unlawful enemy combatants the case couldnt proceed the judge did leave open the possibility that the case could resume if mr khadr was reclassified and prosecutors said that as a member of al qaeda he clearly met the criteria to be called an unlawful combatant col brownback said the case was "dismissed without prejudice" and gave prosecutors hours to appeal but the appeals court provided for under the commissions act hasnt yet been set up army maj beth kubala said that the ruling demonstrated the fairness of the commissions system and that its "procedures and rules are robust and grant significant rights to the accused " defense attorneys said the ruling could apply to all of the nearly terrorism suspects who are now being held at the guantanamo as none of them had been classified as unlawful enemy combatants marine col dwight sullivan the top military defense attorney at the guantanamo said that the classification issue is "not a technicality " and that it could lead to the demise of the redrawn tribunal system speaking after the decision was issued col sullivan called it "another demonstration that the system simply doesnt work it is a system of justice that does not comport with american values " so far the military has only charged three detainees under the new tribunal system australian david hicks pleaded guilty to providing material support to al qaeda and is currently serving a nine month prison term in his native country salim ahmed hamdan who allegedly was a driver for al qaeda mastermind osama bin laden has been charged with providing material support to terrorists and also conspiracy he was also facing a hearing at guantanamo today the pentagon had said that it expects to charge around detainees being held at the facility mr khadr will not be freed and col brownback said the government was permitted to refile its charges shanghai rumbles but no shockwaves beijing has worried for months that chinese investors were snapping up stocks without paying careful enough heed to the risks now regulators are staring at a different problem investors cant seem to get rid of their shares fast enough last week the government decided to triple a stock transaction tax in an effort to bring the roaring chinese stock market to heel but indeed it seems that their plan may have worked too well the shanghai composite index dropped today and has now plummeted by a whopping in the four trading sessions since the tax increase went into effect todays fall marked the second steepest drop for the market in a decade chasing closely on the heels of the drop that helped to set off a dizzying global selloff in late february and more than half of the markets main class of shares finished todays torrid session down by the single day limit of to be certain the tax increase is far from onerous as it lifted the levy on a &# trade by just &# but the psychological impact is perhaps more important as the move marked the very first time that china had taken direct aim at cooling off the countrys sizzling market and a government editorial featured on the front pages of a number of financial newspapers asking investors to be rational didnt help matters despite its attempted assurance that the move was only aimed at tamping down speculation many investors parsed the piece as a signal that theres more where the tax increase came from other asia markets took the news in stride as japans nikkei climbed to a three month high and stock gauges in hong kong seoul and taiwan all rose european markets also seemed unfazed though many markets were weaker as investors decided to engage in some profit taking and utilities stocks declined and while wall street was under some selling pressure the losses seen by the key u s indexes certainly were nowhere near the panic that gripped the market the last time that the shanghai index dropped by more than the dow jones industrial average was stronger by points rising to the nasdaq composite index scratched out a gain of
