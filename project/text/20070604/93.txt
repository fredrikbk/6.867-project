small business link start up lures talent with creative pitch red studios created a wish list of its ideal job candidates and set up a campaign to woo each one four months ago a fedex box landed on the desk of scott youngblood a videogame designer working in bend ore inside he found a glossy box nestled in thick foam inside that box was another and within that one another eventually mr youngblood opened five boxes nested russian doll style and discovered an ipod shuffle music player engraved with his name he pressed play and heard the voice of mark kern president and chief executive of online videogame maker red studios inc talking about mr youngbloods past work on games and inviting him to a web site to learn more about red "i was blown away " says mr youngblood within two weeks he interviewed at red and a little over a month later he started a new job there leaving his position at sony corp s sony computer entertainment america and moving more than miles away mr youngbloods package was one of that red sent to its "dream hires " identified through a concerted recruiting campaign four months after the recruiting effort launched three of the candidates have joined the aliso viejo calif upstart while one is currently interviewing and industry buzz about the campaign has helped to raise the companys profile red has struggled to compete against established well known companies to attract top talent traditional postings on industry web sites didnt generate enough resumes placing ads next to big companies or setting up booths beside them at industry fairs mr kern says "diminished the perception of the opportunity and didnt do us any good " its a perennial concern for small companies with limited resources recruiting budgets and name recognition "most people you want are probably working " rather than trolling job boards says dave lefkow chief executive officer of talentspark a recruiting consultancy in seattle so experts say small firms resources are often best spent focusing on ideal job candidates and courting them in attention grabbing ways rather than casting a wide net with job listings and waiting for candidates to come to them "the key point is creativity" for small companies mr lefkow says red was founded in by several members of the team behind the popular online game "world of warcraft " it has employees in the u s and in china and hopes to fill as many as additional positions in coming months red was self funded until late last year when it received &# million from venture capital firms benchmark capital and sierra ventures both based in menlo park calif last summer a company board member quizzed the year old mr kern about how hiring was going and he says he could answer only that he had ads placed and recruiters working on searches "the resume flow was very poor " he says "no one had heard of us " with many competitors trying to double their team size mr kern adds "its pretty tough out there " the director told him he wasnt looking for the right people or using the best methods so mr kern decided to come up with a wish list of videogame pros he would ideally like to hire and find a way to tell them about red s plans to build its flagship game he hoped to fill three or four key positions and sow the seeds for more hiring red s staff then numbering brainstormed on a roster of about sought after game developers then mr kern and about employees spent four months learning what they could about each "the hardest part of the project was the research " he says "it starts with google and you branch out from there " they rented and played the developers games looking for the animation style or technology they wanted in their games hunting for clues to individualize each pitch the team tracked down the prospects blogs and posts in industry forums the list eventually narrowed to at the same time red looked for help in crafting the pitch the company spent &# working with a seattle design firm that mr kern says didnt seem to understand who red was trying to reach so he turned to san francisco based pool whose package designs he had seen and liked after considering a few options including an envelope containing a key to be followed the next day by a locked box the company settled on the nested ipods mr kern installed a chinese gong in the office to ring each time a candidate contacted him the day the packages were expected to arrive "nothing happened " he says "it was nail biting " but within a couple of days the gong was ringing so often the building manager called to complain he says the projects initial budget was &# a figure mr kern says is "laughable " by the time the company was finished it spent &# about as much as it would cost to pay a recruiter to fill two key positions he estimates talentsparks mr lefkow says firms lacking the same kind of recruiting budget can still replicate red s strategy for instance a company could offer gift cards or an invitation to a company hosted event or luring talented candidates could be as simple as sending flowers and a note or a birthday card also small firms have an advantage in being able to reach out from the ceos office a touch thats appreciated by job candidates mr lefkow says and thats difficult for big companies to replicate because big company ceos typically dont get involved in rank and file hiring mr lefkow adds that when companies dont have a lot of money to spend its important that they focus on the right pool of candidates while red s project drew the hires and interest hoped for it was costly and time consuming mr kern says and the firm doesnt plan to repeat it anytime soon "our resume flow is about times what it was before the campaign " he says the company lists job openings on its web site but it doesnt post paid ads on job sites anymore less quantifiable are the relationships forged and the boost to the firms cachet within the industry the campaign triggered a wave of blog posts from gamers recruiters and marketers
