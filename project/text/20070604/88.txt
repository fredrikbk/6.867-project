putin threatens west over plan to deter missiles as g prepares to meet russian leader talks of retargeting europe novo ogaryovo russia president vladimir putins threat to retarget russias missiles toward europe ratchets up already simmering east west tensions just as the u s and europe were seeking to cool them mr putin said in an interview ahead of a summit this week of the worlds major powers that russia would take the action if washington went ahead with plans to install an antimissile shield in some former soviet bloc countries coming just days before mr putin meets with president bush and other leaders from the group of eight industrialized nations in germany the comments underscore the dilemma western leaders face in dealing with a russia that is increasingly intolerant of dissent at home and blunt in its economic and foreign relations meeting late friday with reporters from a small group of newspapers including the wall street journal mr putin rejected as "stupidity" a british request to extradite a russian man accused of murdering a russian exile last year in london and parried concerns about the kremlins crackdown on domestic critics and increasing state ownership of key industries but mr putin reserved his sharpest comments for security policy he accused the u s of filling eastern europe with new bases and weapons in what he said appeared to be an effort to provoke russia into a new arms race if the u s goes ahead with its missile shield plan in europe "we will have to get new targets in europe " mr putin said "which weapons will be used ballistic missiles cruise missile or some completely new systems thats a technical matter " since missiles can be aimed and re aimed quickly a retargeting would have little practical impact on europes security but it would be significant politically marking russias partial return to a cold war footing washington and its european allies have tried to balance criticism of moscow with conciliation in an effort not to jeopardize russian cooperation on key international issues such as curbing irans nuclear ambitions for europe russia is also a critical source of natural gas and oil while mr bush complained last week about "rhetoric that relives the cold war " for example he also invited mr putin to a summit at his familys summer home in maine next month but european and u s officials say mr putins aggressive stance though it could be aimed at shoring up his popularity at home is prompting them to take a firmer line with the kremlin in part by more fully coordinating their own positions over more than hours friday at a briefing and then dinner at his official country residence west of moscow mr putin repeatedly responded to journalists questions about the kremlins crackdown on domestic critics by detailing what he said were widespread human rights abuses in other g countries mr putin also said he remains committed to a "liberal market economy" and pledged that state ownership of important industries such as energy wouldnt grow further he said foreign investors are welcome in the strategic energy sector but he offered no indication that a bp plc venture might win a reprieve from russias threat to revoke its permit for a &# billion natural gas project in siberia over accusations the venture failed to meet production targets the russian president also reiterated his plans to step down at the end of his term next year as the constitution mandates and gave few hints about whom he would like to see succeed him or what he plans to do once he leaves office frequently lacing his answers with sarcasm the former kgb agent spoke without notes displaying a mastery of topics ranging from latvian gas prices to japanese fishing practices to how many protesters have been killed in germany by police using electric stun guns he skipped all but the dessert wild strawberry soup with vanilla ice cream of the elegant dinner prepared by one of moscows most prominent restaurateurs bringing the evening to a close only after an aide told him it was nearly midnight the focus of discussion was rising east west tensions mr putin insisted russia seeks dialogue not confrontation with the west but he made no effort to conceal his threatening tone the u s plan for a missile shield in europe involves building installations in poland and the czech republic and russia is suspicious of the u s s ultimate intentions for the system russia and the u s announced in the s that they had stopped aiming their thousands of nuclear missiles at each other in a gesture of reconciliation as the cold war ended though russia has never said where its missiles are targeted the de targeting was thought to include europe it was a largely symbolic move in any case as missiles can be assigned a target within minutes according to military experts in an interview yesterday a u s state department official called mr putins missile targeting comments "unfortunate and disheartening" but said the u s will continue its efforts to engage russia mr bush will visit both the czech republic and poland on this weeks trip to europe which begins today he is scheduled to give a speech tuesday in prague on his campaign to promote democracy in the middle east and elsewhere and administration officials say russia remains a focus of that effort the u s insists the planned shield isnt aimed at advanced arsenals like russias but is a more limited system to block potential strikes from countries such as iran mr putin rejected this claim and dismissed washingtons offers to cooperate on the system as disingenuous saying they amounted to no more than russia allowing its missiles to be used for "target practice " u s officials have sought to avoid matching the kremlins tough talk mr bush is expected to meet one on one with mr putin during the g meeting which starts wednesday but his administration has left criticism of russia mostly to less senior officials hoping to preserve what both sides say is a cordial personal relationship between the presidents in hopes of ensuring progress on international issues like iran the results so far have been mixed after a visit to moscow in mid may u s secretary of state condoleezza rice thought she had won mr putins agreement to tone down the rhetorical attacks but the kremlin has shown little sign of doing so last week for example it touted the test of a new intercontinental missile system as a response to washingtons missile defense plans in recent months russias harsh stand on the antimissile system along with increasing tensions with european union members along its borders and growing concerns that moscow is using its vast energy resources as a political lever has increasingly galvanized european nations to stand up to the kremlin officials say "i have seldom seen such a consensus among europeans and americans in private about russia as i have now " said the u s state department official an eu russia summit last month was widely regarded as a turning point for the bloc unlike at previous meetings the eu members agreed ahead of time on a common line to take with mr putin on disputes ranging from moscows longstanding ban on meat imports from poland to a massive cyber attack launched from mainly russian computers against estonia the g summit this week will be the first at which mr putin has no dependable european friends at the table german chancellor gerhard schroeder italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and french president jacques chirac all have now been replaced by more skeptical leaders relations between moscow and london have been in a deep freeze since the murder last november in london of alexander litvinenko a putin critic who died from a dose of radioactive polonium last month british prosecutors charged andrei lugovoi a former kgb agent with the murder and asked moscow to extradite him for trial noting that the russian constitution doesnt allow extradition mr putin said the british request was either the result of "stupidity" or "politics " he called on london to turn over its evidence so the case could be prosecuted in russia something the british have refused to do mr putin said british authorities bear some of the responsibility for the murder because they granted asylum to "scoundrels" an apparent reference to putin critics such as billionaire boris berezovsky who have sought refuge in britain from prosecution in russia offering to quote from amnesty internationals latest annual report in which the human rights group highlights violations in the u s and european nations among other countries mr putin rejected criticism that the kremlin was cracking down on opponents at home and undermining democratic institutions "i am an absolutely pure democrat the real tragedy is that i am the only one elsewhere in the world there just arent any others " he added sarcastically cataloging human rights abuses outside russia "since mahatma gandhi died theres just nobody left to talk to " he joked on economic policy he said the kremlin doesnt plan to increase state ownership in industry and might one day sell stakes in newly created state controlled holding companies in such sectors as aviation and shipbuilding foreign investors are welcome even in the strategic energy sector he said contrasting russia to countries like mexico and saudi arabia where the state controls the oil industry but he noted that bp and its russian partners should have known that they might have difficulty meeting production obligations from the kovykta gas field in siberia when they started the project in the s mr putin said he didnt know whether russian regulators would revoke the production license for the project as they have threatened alan cullison in moscow and
