bullets and ballots army takeover in bangladesh stalls key muslim democracy u s u n backed move to prevent flawed vote mass jailings in dhaka dhaka bangladesh when the bangladesh army intervened to abort a flawed election in this muslim nation of million in january the u s and united nations both offered tacit support for the coup but now the army installed caretaker government is back pedaling on its pledge to organize a quick clean vote and then relinquish authority and the once bloodless coup is turning into something more sinister since january an estimated people including hundreds of leading politicians and businessmen have been jailed under emergency rules that suspend civil rights and outlaw all political activity according to human rights groups scores of others seized by the troops in the middle of the night have been tortured to death or summarily executed bangladeshs new rulers insist the crackdown is needed to reform what international watchdogs such as transparency international have frequently ranked as the most corrupt nation on earth "we do not want to go back to an elective democracy where corruption is all pervasive and where political criminalization threatens the very survival and integrity of the state " the army chief of staff lt gen moeen uddin ahmed explained in a rare speech in april but critics say the outcome amounts to this with the support of the u s and the international community what used to be the worlds second largest muslim democracy after indonesia has turned into the worlds second largest military regime after pakistan bangladeshs new government "is very quickly squandering the goodwill that it had at the beginning " says brad adams asia director for human rights watch "at this point its quite clear the army is running the country and theyre making it pretty clear they dont intend to leave anytime soon " for the u s this unexpected turn of events presents a dilemma bangladesh has long been a u s ally at the strategic crossroads of india and china but its version of democracy had been hijacked by two powerful political dynasties that resorted to violence and graft in their contest for power and that struck alliances with radical islam by contrast the new military backed government in dhaka is positioning itself as an eager participant in the u s led global battle against islamic extremists yet a protracted military dictatorship in bangladesh could end up backfiring and catalyze the so far limited support for these extremists echoing what happened in pakistan following gen pervez musharrafs coup in there the islamists have become the main political alternative to the regime as increasingly strict religious observance spreads throughout the country amid violence by fundamentalist groups to disrupt this dynamic in other places since the sept terrorist attacks the administration of president bush has been pushing to democratize the muslim world this strategy has been dented by electoral victories that islamists often win when given a chance from lebanon to egypt to palestinian territories but islamists have always fared badly at the polls in bangladesh a former province of pakistan that became independent in a bloody war in islamists backed the losing side since bangladesh also had a democratic system that however imperfect allowed the opposition to oust incumbent governments in generally free and fair elections something that almost never happens in the arab world so far the bush administration has abstained from open criticism of the new bangladeshi governments behavior though at a briefing last month state department spokesman sean mccormack urged bangladesh to "move as quickly and as effectively as it can to elections " harsher words are coming from congress in a may letter to the bangladeshi government senators expressed "strong concern over the ongoing state of emergency" and "custodial deaths" in the country they also urged a prompt restoration of "full civil and political rights to all citizens of bangladesh " signers include democratic presidential hopefuls hillary clinton joseph biden and christopher dodd as well as a handful of republicans including richard lugar officials in dhaka respond to such criticism by saying foreigners just dont appreciate the magnitude of the new governments task "after the collapse of the civilian government after a civil war situation dont you think it takes time for any government to bring the law and order situation under control " says mainul hussein the caretaker minister of law justice and information in an interview mr hussein adds that that hes particularly "fed up" with westerners bringing up human rights abuses in his country "bangladesh is going through a huge crisis " he says "is this the time to discuss individual cases individuals are not important " the civil strife that the army backed regime stepped in to quell sprang out of a bitter personal conflict between the two individuals who had taken turns in governing bangladesh over the past years the first khaleda zia prime minister in and is the widow of the general who led bangladeshs independence war against pakistan and who was later assassinated by army officers in a coup attempt the second sheikh hasina was prime minister in she is the daughter of bangladeshs founding prime minister along with most of her immediate relatives he had been slaughtered by soldiers in an earlier coup the two women who still command the loyalty of millions of supporters cooperated in organizing mass pro democracy protests that ousted a previous military regime in late since then however bangladeshs political life was defined by their increasingly acrimonious feud though ms hasina is seen as slightly more secularist and liberal than ms khaleda both women built their political parties through patronage networks and dynastic allegiances rather than well defined ideologies the two parties sold parliament seats to deep pocketed businessmen used criminal gangs to silence critics and funded election campaigns through extortion independent observers and western diplomats say during ms khaledas second term in particular "mafia like structures captured the state " says kamal hossein a prominent lawyer and the drafter of bangladeshs constitution though this pervasive corruption deterred many foreign investors bangladeshs economy dominated by agriculture and textiles and dependent on remittances by overseas workers benefited from the recent economic boom in its neighbors india and china while bangladeshs per capita income still remains below &# a year among the worlds lowest the countrys economy last year expanded by a healthy this growth however received a hit at the end of as the long running hostility between ms khaleda and ms hasina flared up ahead of elections scheduled for jan ms hasina was believed to be the front runner especially after she put together a broad alliance that despite her partys secular roots also included a radical islamist group that admired afghanistans notorious former rulers the taliban ms khaleda whose governing coalition already included islamic fundamentalists was widely seen as attempting to fix the upcoming vote a study by the u s national democratic institute which was observing the campaign found that the updated voter rolls inexplicably contained some million more names than would be possible given the countrys population the supposedly independent electoral commission stacked with ms khaledas supporters did little to purge these phantom voters and to address other concerns raised by the opposition in response ms hasina and her allies angrily withdrew from the election they viewed as irreparably fraudulent and vowed to disrupt it by force strikes road blockades and clashes of armed gangs supporting the two rivals spread all over the country derailing economic activity and causing dozens of deaths amid the bloodshed u s ambassador patricia butenis and other western envoys shuttled between the two warring women in a futile attempt to find a compromise ms butenis warned ms khaleda and ms hasina that the bangladeshi army could intervene if the situation deteriorated any further people familiar with these meetings say bangladeshi generals at the same time were informed in separate meetings that most western ambassadors would pull out of dhaka if the controversial election took place according to a senior member of the bangladeshi military ms khaleda discounted this talk of a putsch confident of the armys support ms hasina says she believed an army intervention would be in her favor indeed until the very last moment bangladeshi generals seemed reluctant to strike trying to be seen as a benign enlightened force after democracy was restored the army has focused on helping the u n maintain peace and organize free elections in the worlds trouble spots nearly bangladeshi soldiers are deployed today under u n command in lebanon congo ivory coast and elsewhere an arrangement that lets them earn more during a year on u n payroll than in a lifetime at home following extensive consultations with the u s and other western nations which by then had denounced the upcoming election as unfair and pulled out observers the u n on jan took action in a formal statement released in dhaka the most senior u n official in bangladesh renata lok dessallien cautioned that the scheduled election "would not be considered credible or legitimate " because of this her statement warned there may be "implications" for the bangladesh armys future participation in u n peacekeeping should the election be allowed to take place before the day was over a delegation of bangladeshi generals led by the chief of staff gen moeen walked into the office of the countrys president a supporter of ms khaleda with the u n statement in hand according to senior officers they demanded that the jan election be canceled and that power be transferred to a new caretaker administration hand picked by the army the army by then had disconnected the land line and cellular phones of ms khaleda and her top aides the president complied in a statement released shortly thereafter the u s government noted that it had been urging ms khaledas and ms hasinas parties "to engage in dialogue to resolve their differences and to refrain from violence" and added that the bangladeshi authorities "felt compelled to declare a state of emergency " a u s official says that while the u s government did not "actively" seek a coup it felt "relief" that a catastrophe had been averted ms dessallien of the u n has declined to comment on the record about her role in these events the new government installed by bangladeshs army is headed by fakhruddin ahmed a respected former world bank economist and central bank governor dr ahmed insists that he and not the army is ultimately in charge some foreign diplomats who deal with the regime and many bangladeshis dispute that in his first speech in january dr ahmed declared he is "pledge bound to hold new elections within the shortest possible time " other government officials said at the time that an elected successor would take over within three to six months but in his second speech three months later dr ahmed announced that the election wont be held before the end of and that the country must first undergo profound reforms transforming it into a "luminous star of good governance in south asia " before any vote bangladeshi officials say now new voter rolls must be prepared complete with computerized photo ids a formidable task in a country with barely functioning infrastructure and a population that is more than illiterate "im in doubt as to whether they really want to hold an election " ms hasina says in an interview at her tightly guarded residence minutes after consoling crying wives of her detained supporters the army meanwhile has attempted to push ms khaleda and ms hasina into exile informed by the directorate general of forces intelligence while visiting the u s in april that she could not return home ms hasina kept trying to board bangladesh bound planes in london international indignation forced bangladesh to reverse the ban a separate attempt to exile ms khaleda to saudi arabia failed because the saudi embassy wouldnt issue her a visa so while ms khaleda and ms hasina remain relatively free the new government concentrates on destroying their political parties locking up former ministers parliament members mayors and senior apparatchiks those in jail include the secretary general of ms hasinas party as well as ms khaledas son tarique rahman who had amassed great fortune and power as her likely successor some independent human rights campaigners who criticize the army have also been thrown behind bars hasan mashhud chowdhury a retired lieutenant general who was appointed in february to head the countrys powerful new anti corruption commission calculates that "at least " of bangladeshi politicians are corrupt a return to democracy without eliminating the existing political establishment would be pointless he explains in an interview "half of these corrupt ones will come back as members of parliament again so you will not have achieved anything by having an election " one method followed by mr chowdhury gen moeens immediate predecessor as army chief of staff in his purges is to demand from his targets a complete statement of assets which must be prepared within a few days those whose statements show even a minor discrepancy with actual assets are detained pending a trial by special fast track courts bail is usually not allowed this crackdown along with daily detentions carried out directly by the army has caused a panic in bangladeshs business community frightened by the seeming randomness of many arrests as a result inflation has spiked and economic growth is expected to slow down this year "in this country corruption was systemic but there are a lot of people who are much more corrupt than the ones theyve arrested " complained abdul awal mintoo former president of the federation of bangladesh chambers of commerce and industry and chief executive of the multimode group a dhaka based conglomerate "all of us are corrupt here " he added over coffee on a recent afternoon "can you take everybody to jail in this country " a few days later bangladeshs military took him into custody in its latest round of arrests under emergency rules
