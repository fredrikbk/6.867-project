the afternoon report chinas mixed message online edition beijing has worried for months that chinese investors were snapping up stocks without paying careful enough heed to the risks now regulators are staring at a different problem investors cant seem to get rid of their shares fast enough last week the government decided to triple a stock transaction tax in an effort to bring the roaring chinese stock market to heel but indeed it seems that their plan may have worked too well the shanghai composite index dropped today and has now plummeted by a whopping in the four trading sessions since the tax increase went into effect todays fall marked the second steepest drop for the market in a decade chasing closely on the heels of the drop that helped to set off a dizzying global selloff
