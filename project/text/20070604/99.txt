the doctors office chronic pain or drug addiction a prescribing quandary for doctors online edition it was sunday morning on my weekend off and i was stalked by a narcotic seeker she conned the hospital operator twice into paging me to get around my partner who was on call then she made eight phone calls to my home throughout the day thanks to caller id i was able to avoid them multiple calls to my house outside of office hours for pain meds is a red flag for a patient with a drug problem so is using extraordinary measures to work around my on call partner ive seen both of these warning signs before doctors are often accused of not adequately treating pain and being insensitive to patients needs but they also have found themselves prosecuted or disciplined by licensing boards for prescribing too much pain medication trying to find a balance can be tricky the quandary has intensified in recent years with an increase in abuse of narcotic painkillers because of the potential for patient addiction and the resulting liability risk some physicians would like to avoid treating patients with pain medications all together i dont want to go that far there certainly are patients that have lifelong pain and have permanent pain medication needs i write prescriptions for strong medications narcotic medications that could become addictive without worrying too much about it i have a lady with clogged arteries in her legs who is on mg of oxycontin daily and has been for years such patients may require a lot of medication to get relief but their needs and their medication dosages seem to be stable they often require gradual dosage increases but most dont really "want" the increase due to side effects on the other hand the addict patients want higher doses more often and they quickly go through anything i might give them when i prescribe long term narcotics for a patient i think to myself "could i defend this to doctors on the licensing board are this patients needs potentially worth the scrutiny i might get " i admit that the headlines of doctors being prosecuted for prescribing pain medications have made me gun shy some patients are outright fakers looking for a fix i found out that the nice married guy with three kids id been treating with the common anti anxiety medication xanax was dealing cocaine out of his house the cocaine was evidently causing his anxiety he fooled me initially but not for long as the small town family doctor has a broad network of sources sometimes what patients really need is a drug treatment program rather than a steady supplier for their vicodin scripts they doctor shop and often come from a distance when every doctor in their own community and their local e r has wised up to their activities were supposed to sort out the good true chronic pain from the bad drug addiction without an underlying health malady but often its not easy the toughest are the patients with an appropriate diagnosis for chronic pain medication but who also have addictive tendencies patients with prescription drug addiction seek narcotics by feigning or magnifying common ailments like chronic daily headaches a bad back or chronic abdominal pain they complain of pain from disorders that often cant be objectively verified and they often ask for their drug of choice by name they claim to be allergic to essentially any pain medication that cant give them a mind altering buzz drug seekers tend to tell lies about their past evaluations and activities having the old records is the key to the real story a review of one patients records showed she had requested a refill of her medication after "her cat knocked it over in the sink " she had told the same story to three different doctors over the span of five years such patients take medication more frequently than they should then call with a really good story and emotional plea for an early refill running a little short one time is believable but for drug addicts this is a chronic problem that escalates patients who call the office after a few days claiming intolerance to a drug i just prescribed are often looking to get an extra script of a similar drug it worked the first time but now im wise to the ploy clinics have sprung up to help patients with chronic pain and sometimes they do help but ive also seen from several clinics a preference for doing profitable procedures on people followed by physical therapy until the insurance benefit runs out then the patients are dumped right back in my lap with the same issues and medication challenges they started with taking care of patients with tough pain problems and sometimes hidden agendas is negotiating a liability mine field two patients that i turned down for pain medications later overdosed on another doctors prescription one of them complained bitterly to her hmo that i wouldnt meet her demands for the type of pain medications she eventually overdosed on my weekend caller will be getting some help with her drug problems or she will be getting another doctor
