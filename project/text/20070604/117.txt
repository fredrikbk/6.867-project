why all eyes are on milbergs bershad a guilty plea from lesser known firm insider in kickback case could have a domino effect in the closely watched prosecution of pioneering plaintiffs law firm milberg weiss &amp bershad llp observers have focused on two men who led the firm but werent charged melvyn weiss and bill lerach now eyes are on a lesser known figure a name partner whose colloquy with prosecutors could influence the fate of the other two and the firm as a whole david bershad indicted just more than a year ago along with the class action law firm itself on charges he and the firm funneled kickbacks to clients is in talks with the government to plead guilty and provide evidence in the matter say people familiar with the case talks could break down but if a deal goes through that involves his cooperating with the government it could mark a potential turning point in a criminal probe that has persisted for more than six years the case has riveted both the legal world it is the highest profile indictment of a law firm and the larger business community milberg weiss helped shape the area of shareholder class actions in which lawyers sue companies after stock dips typically the suits claim investors were misled about the companys financial health many business executives have seen the class actions as expensive nuisance suits that mostly enrich lawyers advocates maintain the suits keep public companies accountable when milberg itself was indicted for alleged wrongdoing last year it was a rich irony for the firms detractors while some in the firms camp saw the governments case as a political move designed to hobble the plaintiffs bar mr bershad years old would be the first milberg attorney to enter a guilty plea in the case if he cooperates says a criminal lawyer who has been involved in the case "it could have a domino effect " possibly prompting others with exposure to try to strike deals with the government as a longtime member of firm management who for some time oversaw the firms finances mr bershad has an intimate knowledge of milbergs affairs lawyers say he has had close dealings with mr weiss the head of milberg weiss and mr lerach a former partner who left in to continue his lucrative practice at his own firm the san diego based lerach coughlin stoia geller rudman &amp robbins llp messrs weiss and lerach have been investigated but neither has been charged "its hard to get the top players without getting cooperation from the next layer beneath them " says andrew hruska a former federal prosecutor and now a partner at king &amp spalding llp who isnt involved in the case the bershad plea discussions have been accompanied by a flurry of activity it emerged last week that mr lerach has also held discussions with the government though the timing of those talks is unclear mr lerachs firm announced friday that he is considering retiring the firm said the milberg probe "should not become a distraction" for the san diego firm milbergs own settlement talks with the government began after mr bershad began talking to the u s attorneys office according to a person familiar with the sequence of events mr bershads lawyer robert luskin declined to confirm whether his client had engaged in plea discussions mr bershad who is on leave from the firm didnt return a call for comment steven schulman a former partner also indicted retired from the firm in a statement milberg weiss said "we have heard reports that david j bershad apparently plans to plead guilty to some of the charges that have been asserted against him we intend to take steps necessary to protect the interests of our clients and of the many uninvolved firm lawyers and staff who have demonstrated their dedication to the firm " mr lerach and his lawyer didnt return calls for comment mr weisss lawyer benjamin brafman said "mr weiss has not been charged with any criminal conduct whatsoever he fully intends to continue practicing law and will continue to offer his clients the same extraordinary legal representation he has always provided for the last years " a graduate of columbia university school of law mr bershad in was the first associate hired by mr weiss and the now deceased lawrence milberg he later became the partner in charge of milbergs new york office and a member of the firms executive committee for a time sharing "final decision making authority over all actions" of the firm according to the may indictment from to according to the indictment mr bershad at times owned as much as of the firm and his share of its profit was more than &# million "he had direct personal dealings with mel weiss and bill lerach " says howard sirota a new york plaintiffs lawyer who has worked with milberg weiss in cases and has also competed with the firm for business the indictment alleges milberg attorneys paid kickbacks to clients so they would have a stable of plaintiffs to sue corporations for misleading investors prosecutors say the kickbacks violated state laws barring lawyers from offering financial inducements to file lawsuits according to the indictment mr bershad allegedly directed kickbacks to plaintiffs by writing checks to "intermediaries" who then disbursed funds to clients mr bershad also allegedly kept cash in a safe in his office to which access "was strictly limited" to pay kickbacks according to the indictment in a statement issued the day of the indictment mr weiss said the firm had "voluntarily adopted a system to ensure that no outside firm or attorney receiving a referral fee from milberg weiss would share any portion with a client " mr bershad maintained a low profile "it was a good cop bad cop thing mel would scream and david would close out the deal quietly " says mr sirota lawyers say mr bershad used a detailed knowledge of corporate finance to figure out how much could be demanded of milbergs targets mr bershad who had a bloomberg terminal in his office would suggest creative financial solutions to settling cases if for example a company didnt have a lot of cash says a former partner the trial is set for january last week the government agreed to give milberg weiss and mr bershad delays of two weeks to file motions to dismiss the criminal charges a possible sign that settlement deals could be imminent
