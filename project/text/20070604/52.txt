investing in funds a monthly analysis question of the month are private equity deals a good thing the complaints have been mounting from investors including some in the mutual fund world private equity firms are buying public companies on the cheap making it likely they will reap big profits when they sell them off in a few years some shareholders want to know why they shouldnt get more out of the original buyout to quell the criticism and help ensure that angry shareholders dont derail the gravy train some novel deals have been struck of late offering shareholders a piece of any future windfall when public companies go private through buyouts mutual funds and other investors owning them usually get cash for their shares but in at least two deals awaiting shareholder approval shareholders could elect to exchange some of their shares for stock in the new privately owned companies so called stub equity the deals are pending at radio and outdoor advertising company clear channel communications inc and at audio and electronics company harman international industries inc while these pacts arent certain to win approval some wall street analysts see stub equity deals as the wave of the future as private equity funds work harder to win feisty shareholders over what does it all mean for small investors here are some questions and answers about this latest development as cash rich private equity firms continue to swing through big sections of the economy taking public companies private q how likely is my mutual fund to take stub equity instead of cash a this is a new area and many fund managers are still digging through their rules and holding meetings to determine whether stub equity is an asset class they can hold or want to capital research &amp management co which runs the american funds group and fidelity investments say there is nothing that would prevent them from taking stub equity but that doesnt mean they will jeff tjornehoj a senior research analyst at fund tracker lipper inc anticipates that the funds "more likely" to go for stub equity would be those with "very aggressive growth styles " q why would taking a stake appeal to these managers but not some others a private equity firms generally aim for returns on equity of or more a year they obtain these returns by moves such as restructuring the acquired companies selling assets laying off employees and layering on debt if the private equity funds botch the job of running the company a bet on stub equity wouldnt pay off the shares could badly trail other potential investments or worse the company could end up in bankruptcy court weighed down by its heavier debt load in bankruptcy court debt holders are repaid before shareholders "in something thats more leveraged you need to be compensated for that risk " says henry ellenbogen a manager at t rowe price who runs funds that own both clear channel and harman "the weighted average return would need to cross a higher bar " mr ellenbogens complaints about the price initially offered to clear channel communications by bain capital llc thomas h lee partners and members of the companys founding family were among those leading to a sweetened offer last month with the stub equity option he says he hasnt decided whether he wants to take stub equity in either company q are there any other drawbacks to taking the stub equity a unlike at public companies where mutual funds can wield influence through their ability to vote against board members and various initiatives they oppose owners of private companies call the shots however the clear channel deal comes with independent representation on the private company board for investors q will the stub equity shares trade on the new york stock exchange a no they will trade over the counter there tends to be a more limited number of buyers and sellers there than for most big stocks on exchanges and that might make it hard for a fund to quickly get out of its position most funds that opt to take the stub equity likely will aim to hold onto their stakes until the private equity owners restructure and resell the company q are there any limits on how much stub equity my fund can hold a stub equity is considered a thinly traded or illiquid investment under securities and exchange commission guidelines a fund can put no more than of its assets in such investments other illiquid investments include high yielding municipal bonds and syndicated bank loans individual fund rules might limit such holdings even further or prohibit them altogether q how will my fund calculate its net asset value if it takes stub equity a because stub equity is so thinly traded it will be hard to value many mutual funds likely will turn to valuation services that specialize in assigning value to illiquid assets to help them avoid problems others have run into in the past in years past some mutual funds have been accused by regulators of improperly boosting the value of their illiquid assets to make their performance look better or underestimating them so they appeared to make up a smaller part of the fund than they really do q would my fund get a stake in the private company of the same size it had in the public company a probably not the plan under consideration for clear channel would allow current shareholders including funds to own up to of the private company the plan hammered out by kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and goldman sachs group inc for harman would allow current shareholders to hold up to if more shareholders opt to roll over their shares to the private company than there are available shares then the shares will be distributed on a pro rata basis funds would receive cash for their remaining stake sarah mcbride ms mcbride
