theory &amp practice group turns governance spotlight on pension plans new recommendations provide best practices for retirement funds activist investors such as public employee pension funds have long advocated good governance in corporations now a group of institutional investors have turned the governance lens on themselves publishing "best practices" for fund oversight to address what they see as haphazard standards in the industry pension funds have been "neglected in terms of governance " says peter clapman chairman of the committee that drafted the recommendations and former head of corporate governance for tiaa cref a big retirement plan provider for teachers and others "if were going to espouse certain principles to companies we invest in we should make sure were upholding the same things were espousing " the recommendations were to be released today by a committee of the stanford institutional investors forum an informal group of about institutional investors the suggestions are aimed at lightly regulated nonprofit investors such as pension funds endowments and charitable foundations most are simple ground rules such as disclosing governance guidelines and outlining the duties of trustees a funds equivalent to board directors some recommendations are so elementary they seem hardly worth stating one suggests trustees educate themselves about their duties "a fund should identify and disclose its leadership structure " reads another many funds profess to follow these and other principles yet mr clapman says his group found "a very large percentage of funds are not doing one or more of" the reports recommendations patrick mcgurn who advises institutional investors as vice president of institutional shareholder services says he often sees tension between fund staffers and trustees because of confusion about their responsibilities mr mcgurn says he supports recommendations to clarify the lines of authority and for trustee education at some investor education sessions he says "youre talking about fiduciary responsibility and half the trustees are on the golf course " governance weaknesses have led to problems at some funds and they could attract unwelcome attention from regulators if funds dont clean up their acts mr clapman cautions new jerseys treasury department on thursday said it was cooperating with a securities and exchange commission inquiry into the state pension system which is billions of dollars short in assets to cover obligations last year a former trustee of the illinois teachers retirement system pleaded guilty to accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks from investment firms seeking to do business with the pension provider a spokeswoman for the system which has filed a civil lawsuit against the former trustee and others allegedly involved in the scheme says that the fund had ethical guidelines for its trustees but that those dont help "if someone is bent on breaking the law " in the san diego city employees retirement system projected it was &# billion short of assets to cover its obligations subsequent investigations highlighted poor decisions by the funds board and some former board members face criminal charges a fund sponsored investigation found that former board members ignored conflicts of interest didnt properly investigate funding proposals and failed to heed warnings by experts david wescoe the systems new administrator says the fund has since tightened oversight by adding non trustees to the audit committee and by hiring an internal auditor mr wescoe says the system follows many of the new reports recommendations "i want us to have a better corporate governance structure than any company we would invest in " he says mr clapman got a close look at governance stumbles in his former job at tiaa cref in late two trustees resigned after it was revealed that they had invested in a company that had done business with tiaa crefs independent auditor ernst &amp young an investigation commissioned by tiaas board of overseers which supervises the tiaa trustees attributed the problems to poor judgment rather than malfeasance the investigator said trustees didnt understand the seriousness of conflict of interest violations didnt seek independent advice and were confused about the overseers role those issues are reflected in the new report which advises funds to have an established process to deal with possible conflicts of interest let governing bodies consult outside experts and clarify the duties of fund leaders tiaa cref says it has improved internal communications among its boards and has held joint retreats for all board members the company also bolstered education programs for overseers and trustees and tightened standards for a trustee to be considered independent mr clapman who had announced plans to retire before the tiaa cref problems emerged says the experience taught him the importance of oversight procedures which he tried to incorporate into the new report the committee for instance advises funds to post their governance rules on their web sites write a charter outlining the responsibilities of trustees and staff and analyze board membership annually to make sure they have people versed in finance accounting and portfolio management "our biggest task will be to get behind empty assurances that" funds are already following good governance principles mr clapman says fund governance a group of institutional investors suggests best practices for pension funds endowments and foundations create clear governance rules and publicize them clarify leadership responsibilities ensure trustees understand their duties and get training have a clear policy on potential conflicts of interest tap objective
