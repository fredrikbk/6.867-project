investing in funds a monthly analysis high yield bonds expensive junk debt funds continue to defy odds but with economy slowing is it time for a retrenchment mutual funds focused on junk bonds high yield bonds that ratings agencies consider speculative have been delivering anything but a junky performance this year the groups advance is the best of any morningstar inc bond fund category attracted by the returns investors have been shoveling money into junk bond funds at a pace not seen since but can the junk bond run continue one concern is that high yield debt issuers often carrying more debt than top rated companies will have trouble repaying their loans if the economy continues to slow meanwhile high yield spreads the additional interest you receive for owning riskier bonds relative to treasurys about percentage points currently are about as thin as they have ever been we asked arthur calavritinos manager of john hancock high yield fund for his outlook on this corner of the debt world and for advice on whether individual investors should buy or steer clear of junk bond mutual funds mr calavritinos buys bonds much the same way that "value" investors buy stocks hunting for issues that have fallen sharply in price this approach lifted his &# billion fund to the top of the junk bond fund category in with a total return of for the load waived class of fund shares the return was tops among more than bond funds tracked by lipper inc the fund ranks in the top of its category for the past months top for the past three years and top for the past decade through may according to morningstar here are excerpts the wall street journal in the past junk bonds performance has slipped as the economy weakened why has the markets performance remained so strong even with growth slowing mr calavritinos there is an enormous amount of money out there chasing all sorts of asset classes high yield is one of them when companies run into problems they have the ability to refinance because there is so much money out there when liquidity dries up you are going to have issues but who knows when thatll be wsj so you see potential for a high yield retrenchment mr calavritinos history tells us that at some point you are going to have downward moves timing is the joker wsj markets recently have reacted to worries ranging from the weakening u s housing sector and subprime mortgage market to uncertainty about the chinese economy are these concerns real and how much of a threat do they pose mr calavritinos i think they pose a real risk forget subprime and look at the alt a mortgage market where credit scores are little bit better we have had huge foreclosures in the state of massachusetts look at the construction trade that has driven a lot of the economy we had a gross domestic product growth number for the first quarter that was revised down to last week i think we are at the beginning of something here wsj with historically thin spreads for high yield bonds a lot of people are wary of the high yield market generally where do you stand mr calavritinos all the bond markets are unattractive but we arent macroeconomic guys we get our views from the bottom up by assessing individual bonds having said that we have been focused on real estate there have been a lot of refinancings so people could buy ford trucks and plasma tvs from best buy and the like thats going to create dislocations we are starting to participate in certain mortgage securities right now in the fund wsj so you already see value in lower rated mortgage securities mr calavritinos not so much lower rated im looking at the alt a stuff not subprime it basically has a little less documentation than other stuff while default risk is somewhat lower than with subprime mortgages how you get hurt on those is if people start prepaying you prepayments occur when homeowners as rates drop refinance loans sooner than expected causing mortgage backed bonds to be redeemed early we dont think we have a lot of prepayment risk i think getting new mortgages is tough as so many homeowners dont have refinancing options there is a crackdown going on in credit and the days have ended where you could go on the internet while having your coffee on a sunday morning and get a &# million mortgage approval if history tells us anything there will be opportunities not only in mortgages but in ancillary stuff such as other housing industry securities wsj how would you describe your approach to managing bonds mr calavritinos we participate at all levels of the capital structure i want my guys to understand an entire industry not just focus on one company so while we might have charter communications inc debt we also have comcast corp stock we rarely buy new bond issues because like buying a house everything usually looks nice with a new issue then later you see the damage our sector allocations are very different from any benchmark index there are times when we have been down when the market was up and we were up when the market was down wsj so you are looking for capital appreciation not just yield mr calavritinos yield is seductive right but we would rather buy things that are beaten down you understand what the dangers are theres a lot of stuff i turn down the yield is nice but something could happen to the company and to the enterprise value you wait because every company is going to have problems wsj your biggest bond holdings include airlines cable and a metals company freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc you have almost of the portfolio in northwest airlines corp alone that suggests you dont have caps on what you can own in any one company or industry mr calavritinos there are caps but they are enormous we believe investment insights are very difficult to get so sometimes when you have an insight on an issuer you should take a big position wsj the funds fact sheet shows that your largest allocation is to consumer discretionary companies what are some holdings mr calavritinos thats airlines and satellite radio and maybe cable if you look at cable youve got triple plays of cable tv telephone and internet access service more people are doing the phone service which is incremental to the bottom line more people are buying lcd or plasma tvs who like i did find out that you have to upgrade the service so it works better that is driving the economics we may call it discretionary but i think people would rather not send their kids to college than cut off their cable wsj how should individual investors approach high yield debt funds now is this the time to be more cautious mr calavritinos yes absolutely the marketing guys will kill me for saying that but you are buying at tight spreads if something happens to a company like earnings go down a bond could easily fall sharply in price i always have said that high yield bonds are like equities with a coupon they arent some kind of turbocharged certificate of deposit wsj some investment experts say it is worth keeping a modest portion of junk in a broader portfolio say or of the total mr calavritinos market timing is tough but short term rates are now at or why put or into an asset class that only pays one percentage point more and has that kind of downside just wait wsj how much of your own money is in the fund mr calavritinos not too much i have more in equities of high yield companies when i invest in bonds i like to steal the stuff mr pollock is an special writer for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j he can be reached at michael pollock wsj com
