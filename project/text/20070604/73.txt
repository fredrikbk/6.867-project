on the job at jfk the foiling of the terror plot to set fire to jfk airport in new york is good news on several levels the best news is what didnt happen the fbi and new york police arrested the terrorists before their plan was implemented the point is being made that the plotters goal of blowing up the airport was technically improbable and that they had established no evident source of funding possibly this explains why the new york times chose to run the story off a two inch summary on its front page this doesnt much mitigate the tension felt daily by new yorkers who since september have worried about the vulnerability to an explosion of their subways bridges and crowded street corners running a close second as good news is the fact that the cops are walking the anti terror beat it is evident from this incident that the fbi and local law enforcement authorities have remained focused on discovering surveilling and stopping terrorist acts against the u s mainland this is no small achievement given the recent political climate many other parts of the u s political system including the media have consumed their energies the past several years debating the origins of the iraq war the constitutionality of anti terrorist wiretaps or whether the terrorist prison at guantanamo should be moved to say south carolina it is reassuring to see that the fbi and local cops are doing the hard "dirty" work of watching and wiretapping groups like this one from trinidad and using an informant in this case a twice convicted drug dealer to penetrate the cell a similar focus last month allowed the fbi using two informers to stop an armed terror assault against fort dix in new jersey to murder u s soldiers we commend the cops for staying on the job of thwarting the obviously global terror movement against the u s we urge the political class to join them
