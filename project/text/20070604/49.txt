remind investors of the heady days of and early nearly half the companies that have gone public so far this year have been unprofitable at the time of their debut that is a bigger percentage than any year since the dot com bubble burst seven years ago there are differences this time around however the number of initial public offerings of stock is far below the bubble years and the list of unprofitable companies selling stock for the first time is more diverse it includes listings in energy health care and other sectors in addition to technology companies like those that drove the bull market of the s investors now want more than pie in the sky promises of future profits they are looking at revenue and cash flow and want specific timetables for profitability before buying shares "people were measuring dollars per eyeball on a web site back then " says allison thacker portfolio manager for rs investment management co s growth focused information age fund "theres none of that now " ms thackers fund has bought ipos from unprofitable companies such as last years offering by business software provider omniture but she says her firm generally avoids companies that dont seem likely to turn a profit in to months still there are risks "traditionally there have been some rules of thumb about when to go public and one of them was that you should have profits " says brian hamilton chief executive of research firm sageworks which analyzed ipo filings at the request of the wall street journal he calls some of the latest offerings "troubling" because of the absence of net income of offerings this year more than of the companies were unprofitable at the time of their listing according to the sageworks data that is the biggest percentage since when of the companies that went public were unprofitable but about on par with of offerings in the percentage bottomed at in when the broader stock market hit its post bubble lows and it was about last year according to sageworks the tallies exclude special purpose acquisition companies essentially shell companies that issue stock to raise money for buyouts such offerings which were rare in the dot com era usually show no revenue and no profit at the time of their listings although executives give various reasons for their decisions to take a company public broad market rallies like the current one encourage stock offerings as investors look for new opportunities and companies hope to get higher prices for their shares both the dow jones industrial average and the standard &amp poors stock index hit records last week leaving the dow up this year and the s&amp p ahead while the latest crop of unprofitable companies to go public has attracted investors the companies havent enjoyed the same pricing power as during the bubble years a sign that investors have become more selective one recent high profile example was the ipo of clean energy fuels which offers natural gas as an alternative fuel for trucks and other vehicles the company reported a net loss of &# for the first quarter while revenue rose to &# million according to regulatory filings the shares were initially priced at &# below the

ipo this year has risen on its first day of trading and is up nearly year to date compared with jumps of more than at the height of the dot com bubble "you have more institutional money and more fund managers looking over these deals on a case by case basis now " says thomson financial analyst richard peterson "the retail investor is still not jumping in there because he was burned last time " the sector breakdown of companies going public has changed companies in the internet computer semiconductor and telecommunications sectors accounted for more than of all new u s offerings in according to research firm ipo vital signs by contrast the three biggest sectors this year are finance biotechnology and energy which together represent about half of new offerings some say drug companies may have good reason to go public before posting a profit "its expensive to bring a new drug to market " says jonathan lieber chief financial officer of altus pharmaceuticals which has no drugs on the market
