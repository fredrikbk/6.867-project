investing in funds a monthly analysis when a fund manager leaves investors fret for good reason when tom genovese wanted to increase his holdings in international real estate a few months ago he turned to a mutual fund from a little known firm and passed up an offering from fidelity investments inc his reason the alpine international real estate equity fund run by alpine woods capital investors llc of purchase n y has kept the same portfolio manager samuel lieber since meanwhile the fidelity international real estate fund has switched managers twice in the past two years "thats the kind of manager musical chairs i dont like " says the year old mr genovese director of the orlando division of the south florida water management district "im putting my life savings into mutual funds i dont want someone practicing with my money " fidelity says its new manager steve buller has nine years of experience in the real estate sector and "that the fund is in good hands " and mr buller points out that he managed the fund after it was first launched in and then turned it over to a colleague "i just reassumed something that i had launched many years ago and am very familiar with the space " he says still mr genoveses concern is a common one among mutual fund investors people are often reluctant to invest in a fund that changes managers frequently for fear that the new leader isnt seasoned enough to navigate the sector successfully now theres finally some data to back up the conventional wisdom according to a pair of new studies managers who have been with their funds for a long time tend to deliver better returns than managers with a shorter tenure for the five years ended dec the average tenure of a portfolio manager of a large company stock fund was years according to a study by standard &amp poors corp a division of mcgraw hill cos but the managers who consistently ranked in the top half of the group had a much longer average tenure years in another study s&amp p found that the length of a managers tenure stood out "as a primary differentiator" of the funds that beat their peers or the index tenure was more linked to long term success than lower expenses or diversification of holdings s&amp p didnt provide specific data about that observation however these statistics confirm what many mutual fund watchers already suspect indeed research firms such as chicago based morningstar inc have often relied heavily on manager tenure when analyzing funds when neal miller retired a year ago after managing fidelitys new millennium fund since its inception in morningstar went so far as to say "with the departure of its longtime skipper theres little reason to own this mutual fund " mr miller had a reputation as an eclectic stock picker who consistently beat his peers by being early to spot trends among midsize companies "he was just a tremendous iconoclast " says dan lefkovitz morningstars fidelity analyst "not that the new manager was bad he was unknown " mr millers replacement john roth was a relative fidelity newcomer whose experience was in funds that focus on a specific area such as the chemicals sector rather than in diversified funds like new millennium in the months since mr roth took over the fund has returned lagging behind the total return of its benchmark the s&amp p by contrast in the roughly months before mr miller left the fund returned well above the benchmarks a fidelity spokesman says the company is confident in mr roth along with managing sector funds the spokesman says mr roth was an analyst who supplied "successful investment ideas" to diversified funds in addition "john has only been managing the fund for a little more than nine months which is a relatively short period of time around which to measure performance " says the spokesman "we tend to look at performance over longer periods as do our mutual fund shareholders " fund firms know how suspicious investors can be about management changes the firms are all too aware that they are "vulnerable to having assets march out the door" when top managers leave says jim lowell editor of fidelity investor an independent newsletter about fidelity funds and founder of a subscription service that ranks fund managers big pension funds in particular sometimes yank millions of dollars from a fund company when a successful veteran portfolio manager leaves in january for example the los angeles county employees retirement association took assets out of pyramis global advisors a unit of fidelity why james rutherford a star european portfolio manager for pyramis left after years to go to a smaller firm the pension fund says it was worried about "instability" because of mr rutherfords departure and so it moved more than &# million to barclays global investors a unit of barclays plc a fidelity spokesman says pyramis has retained "the vast majority of assets" invested under mr rutherford and has continued to gain investors in the international funds the pyramis assets are entrusted to money managers peter hadden and steve oler "who have years experience and were very familiar with the strategys investment process " worried about losing assets when star managers leave some fund complexes have started "going toward a team management model to mitigate risks" from manager changes says owen concannon an analyst with financial research corp boston fidelity traditionally has been known for its star system now the firm tries to make funds less dependent on any one manager by hiring more career track analysts who will work on funds for years and thus ensure some continuity even when one particular manager departs says mr concannon fidelity says its goal is to increase the depth of its research team some firms have eschewed the star system for a long time capital research &amp managements american funds for one has used that approach since the fund firm has a general policy of not publicizing the work of individual stock pickers preferring investors to buy instead based on a funds overall investment style the team members are called "portfolio counselors" rather than "portfolio managers " even if fund companies stick with the traditional manager system there are steps they can take to keep investor confidence for instance morningstar continued to rave about massmutual financial groups oppenheimer global fund even after manager bill wilby left the fund in after years at the helm because mr wilby had selected and mentored his successor rajeev bhaman the two had co managed the fund for a year so analysts figured it was unlikely that mr bhaman would remake the fund or stray from his mentors proven strategy of buying on bad news when stocks are often artificially depressed in the roughly months since mr bhaman took over the fund has mostly stayed even with its benchmark the morgan stanley capital international index returning compared with the indexs morningstar says "it was the ideal way to handle a manager transition " says morningstars mr lefkovitz "to tell shareholders about it way ahead of time so the managers can work together on the fund " kurt wolfgruber president and chief investment officer of oppenheimerfunds inc massmutuals money management unit says that the firm recognizes the important role that an experienced manager plays in a funds performance so the firm encourages longtime managers to identify successors and then mentor them "it makes it a much more painless transition " he says all of this means that investors should do some research before choosing a stellar fund that has just waved goodbye to its stock picking guru who is taking over is it someone with a sparse track record or someone who is very experienced is it a longtime analyst whos been with the funds team and knows the strategy if so a manager change might be just fine if the old bench is staying put not all individual investors of course can bail on a fund that already is in their portfolio within employers retirement plans for instance fund options often are limited and investors outside of tax sheltered accounts will want to weigh the consequences of capital gains tax before cashing out but given a choice investors like mr genovese of south florida will pick funds where the nameplates have been up for awhile "i worked hard for my money " he says "i want someone whos been there for a while " ms levitz is a staff reporter in the wall street journals boston bureau she can be reached at jennifer levitz wsj com corrections &amp amplifications powershares capital management is a unit of invesco plc two articles on exchange traded funds in mondays investing in funds section incorrectly identified it as a unit of amvescap plc which was invescos name before shareholders
