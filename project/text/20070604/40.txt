investing in funds a monthly analysis before you drive that hot etf theyre spiffy and alluring but an owners manual is essential for novices what you dont understand about exchange traded funds could hurt you think of it like a typical suburban minivan driver put behind the wheel of a formula one race car small investors trading their steady eddie mutual funds for souped up exchange traded funds are in a similar situation they understand the vehicles basic operation but they may not be able to use it to its full potential and they could be tempted into reckless moves many small investors already understand that etfs are much like index tracking mutual funds yet trade on an exchange like a stock and that they generally charge much lower expenses than conventional mutual funds but there is much more to know about these relatively new funds which like race cars contain complex machinery in a sleek simple package to start with the expense advantages arent always as great as they appear at first glance beyond the brokerage firm commission to buy etf shares there are more complicated trading costs in addition while etfs are similar to index mutual funds they follow a wide assortment of complex benchmarks that can mean very different risks and rewards for investors since many of these funds are brand new they arent truly road tested the back tested performance data used to sell these products are sort of like those car commercials where vehicles are put through their paces by a professional driver on a closed track as the etf industry booms with assets now totaling about &# billion in offerings it is becoming crucial for small investors to understand these funds inner workings here follows an owners manual for etf investors drawing on freshly crunched data and new research by morgan stanley and morningstar inc among others no etfs are cheap but arent always the cheapest investment option the expense ratio which represents the percentage of fund assets deducted each year to cover management fees and other costs takes a bite out of investors returns the etfs with the lowest costs are often those tracking broad well known u s stock market indexes vanguard group inc s vanguard total stock market etf for instance charges a annual expense ratio or &# for every &# invested but many etfs arent rock bottom cheap in fact so many new etfs have hit the market recently with higher fees that the average expense ratio for a u s stock etf has jumped just over the past three months to of assets up from according to morgan stanley amvescap plcs powershares capital management unit one fast growing etf provider charges for most of its industry focused etfs including powershares dynamic retail portfolio powershares dynamic energy sector portfolio and powershares water resources portfolio xshares group llcs healthshares lineup of health care and biotechnology etfs costs at the higher end charging are some leveraged etfs and those that make bearish bets against stocks including proshare advisors llcs ultra s&amp p proshares and short s&amp p proshares the proshare etfs many of which aim to deliver double an indexs performance on a daily basis are more expensive because they "require a specialized level of knowledge and skills to run " says michael sapir chairman and chief executive of proshare advisors he adds that the etfs are cheaper than comparable mutual funds jeff feldman chairman of xshares group says the healthshares etfs which are composed largely of smaller companies are "more difficult to put together " and the funds relatively small size means that their asset based expenses will be higher to be sure all these etfs are still cheap compared with the levied by the average diversified u s stock mutual fund but more than no load u s stock mutual funds sold to small investors offer at least one share class charging or less according to a search by morningstar of its database of roughly u s stock mutual funds some are index funds as those tend to be the least expensive funds in the mutual fund world but hundreds of funds run by stock pickers also made the cut among these vanguard windsor which charges a year and delivered an average annual return in the five years ended may beating the standard &amp poors stock index by more than two percentage points no etfs have layers of complex trading costs a big appeal of etfs is that they can be traded throughout the day on a stock exchange just like a stock and unlike a mutual fund which is typically priced just once a day when markets close at p m eastern time the brokerage commission that investors typically pay to buy or sell an etf is fairly straightforward sometimes it can be less than &# a trade murkier is the bid ask spread an investor buys an etf at the "ask" price and ultimately sells at the "bid" price incurring a cost equal to the difference between the two prices so an investor wants as small a spread as possible think of it as another trading cost like a brokerage commission in general funds that hold heavily traded stocks and track well known indexes tend to have narrower bid ask spreads etfs focused on less heavily traded market segments or that track more exotic indexes often have larger spreads among u s stock etfs for example the fund with the biggest spread in the six months ended april was first trust portfolios lps first trust db strategic value index according to xtf global asset management which tracks rates and builds portfolios of etfs that fund which tracks the obscure deutsche bank croci us+ index a benchmark composed of large cap u s stocks had an average spread of of its share price or roughly cents based on the funds recent &# share price that means that on top of the funds expense ratio and the brokerage commission paid to buy and sell an investor trading the fund at typical market prices over that period may have sacrificed an additional of his or her investment to trading costs according to first trusts own data the etfs spread over a more recent period the year to date has averaged just over cents says first trust senior vice president dan waldron "there are no liquidity issues with this basket of securities " he says in contrast state street global advisors s&amp p tracking standard &amp poors depositary receipts or spdr had an average bid ask spread over the six month period amounting to less than of its share price according to xtf investors can visit xtfs free web site xtf com to learn more about bid ask spreads the site shows an average bid ask ratio for each etf reflecting the bid ask spread as a fraction of the etfs price over the past six months and ranks each etfs bid ask ratio against other funds in its category no the variety of etfs on the market means investors have plenty of choice and plenty of room for confusion two etfs that appear nearly identical on the surface may pursue quite different strategies meaning different returns and risks for investors while the same may be said of conventional mutual funds "there has been more experimentation" in the etf market lately says sonya morris a morningstar analyst a big positive for etfs is that unlike mutual funds they generally publish their holdings each day so investors have the ability to determine exactly whats inside their fund that is why a lot of financial planners trying to allocate clients money precisely across various asset classes like them mutual funds by contrast are required to disclose their holdings only four times a year consider that barclays global investors ishares ftse xinhua china index etf gained last year while powershares golden dragon halter usx china portfolio etf gained a big reason for the performance difference the ishares etf tracks an index of chinese companies that trade on the hong kong stock exchange and roughly of its assets are in financial stocks the powershares etf tracks an index of u s listed companies that get most of their sales from china only about of its assets are in the financial sector etfs tracking the biggest u s stocks also show great variety take the ishares s&amp p index etf which returned a year on average in the three years ended may and rydex investments rydex s&amp p equal weight etf which returned a year on average over that period the performance gap springs from the different weighting schemes employed by the two etfs the ishares fund tracks the traditional s&amp p in which stocks weightings are determined by their market valuation while the rydex fund weights all of the s&amp p stocks equally many other etfs use an approach known as fundamental indexing meaning stocks are weighted on the basis of such measures as dividends or revenue that strategy often gives funds a "value" tilt meaning they favor shares deemed inexpensive on the basis of such things as price earnings ratios for the past seven years in the u s value stocks outperformed "growth" stocks those of companies with rapidly expanding earnings giving value tilted indexes an edge no an index tracking fund doesnt always track its index well to run a portfolio that delivers the exact same return as an index requires skill starting with the decision of how closely a funds holdings should reflect its benchmark some funds buy exactly the same stocks and maintain the same weightings as the underlying index matthew hougan editor of indexuniverse com an index industry web site noted in a recent report that such funds may have higher trading costs but lower tracking error after fees other funds buy only a portion of the indexs stocks in order to lower trading costs but this raises the risk of tracking error mr hougan wrote etf tracking error is on the rise among u s major market etfs the average tracking error in was percentage point up from percentage point the year before according to morgan stanley one reason etfs have become increasingly specialized narrower funds sometimes cant mirror their indexes precisely or they would run afoul of securities and exchange commission rules requiring funds to stay diversified those rules say a fund must invest no more than of assets in a single holding and no more than half of assets in holdings with weightings of or more in the dow jones u s telecommunications index for example at&amp t inc has a roughly weighting but because of the secs requirements at&amp t shares represent only about of barclayss ishares dow jones u s telecommunications sector index etf which tracks the dow jones index the ishares etfs tracking error was roughly percentage points last year according to morgan stanley "not even close " mr hougan says "the fund manager is going to do his best to have a limited amount of tracking error " but given the diversification requirements " is the best you can do " says christine hudacko spokeswoman for barclays in its study of major etf providers tracking error for morgan stanley found a link between fees and a funds ability to track its index vanguard etfs which had the lowest average fees had the lowest average tracking error percentage point in one of the best showings vanguard small cap growth etf deviated from its index by just percentage point according to morgan stanley powershares etfs which had the highest average fees also had the highest average tracking error percentage point the powershares etfs have higher tracking error largely because they often invest in stocks that are difficult to trade and are rebalanced frequently not because they have higher fees says managing director john southard some exchange traded vehicles have a unique structure that cuts investors risk of tracking error barclays last year launched exchange traded notes which are designed to give investors the return of benchmarks such as the msci india total return index minus fees but investors in these vehicles take on some credit risk albeit very slight as the notes are debt issued by barclays bank plc no many etfs lack genuine performance histories while etfs generally offer up long term index track records these figures often are hypothetical "back tested" performance rather than true market returns a funds strong back tested record "is no guarantee it will perform well in the real world " morningstars ms morris says the strong back tests for some indexes tracked by fundamentally weighted etfs like wisdomtree largecap dividend for example reflect the strength of value stocks over the past seven years morgan stanley found in its recent research but the s&amp p topped those value oriented indexes in the late s when growth stocks led the market and soon could lead again if many financial advisers are correct that the reign of value stocks has neared its end while wisdomtrees dividend weighted etfs "will lag if the market gets speculative " the market has consistently awarded a premium to value stocks over time and dividend paying stocks help to reduce the volatility of a portfolio says wisdomtree investments inc president bruce lavine another caveat on back tested results they dont factor in trading costs which include commissions paid to buy or sell stocks as well as "market impact " which refers to the way a fund may move a stocks price by attempting to buy or sell it "i dont think you can question back tested results enough " mr hougan says no some etfs may be fit for hedge funds and other high rollers but not for small investors while many financial advisers and investment professionals admire etfs for their low costs and broad diversification a number of newly launched etfs dont quite fit that description "theres a lot of junk coming out truthfully " says jeff buetow chief investment officer at xtf "many of these things are not well diversified and theyre charging silly fees " a slew of narrowly focused etfs have been launched in recent months many financial advisers feel such funds are a gamble not a long term investment fund companies also have a habit of launching etfs in go go market segments that may deliver eye popping results in the short term but fizzle over the long haul "etfs can be very alluring to performance chasers and a lot of the new rollouts have been in hot market areas " ms morris says "that panders to investors worst instincts " narrow etfs can make sense as a small part of a diversified portfolio morgan stanleys global wealth management group recommends that clients devote a small slice of their cash allocation to rydexs currencyshares euro trust the fund offers "a very cheap way" for small investors to access the currency market which has traditionally been the domain of professional investors says david darst chief investment strategist for the global wealth management group the rapid growth of the etf industry also means that "a lot of people think were in a bubble phase " says mr hougan the indexuniverse com editor "some of these funds may not stick and you dont want to be caught holding a fund that has to be liquidated " if a fund shuts down investors may face a tax bill and be forced to pay additional commissions in order to shift to new holdings
