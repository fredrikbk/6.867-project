the daily fix billy d wants to stay bmoc not become small fish in nba online edition sportswriters may have to quickly tear up their first draft of the history of billy donovans move to the orlando magic on friday mr donovan signed a five year &# million deal to coach orlando leaving behind the florida gators team hed led to the last two national titles and had committed to coaching again next season over the weekend according to several reports he had second thoughts faster than you can say nick saban after mr donovan got an ovation from magic staffers on friday joey johnston wrote in the tampa tribune "clearly this will be a long honeymoon " added gene frenette of the florida times union after watching the magic press conference "the honeymoon had commenced " the coach and the nba team are lovebirds no more but the magic may still try to keep their man if he does return to the college ranks it appears gators fans would welcome him back birmingham news columnist kevin scarbinsky cant figure out why the aforementioned mr saban got so much grief for leaving the miami dolphins to coach alabama yet mr donovan gets a free pass in gainesville despite signing a recruit hiring an assistant and representing florida in the final weeks before his departure orlando sentinel columnist mike bianchi says mr donovan is making the right decision albeit a bit late "he still has a chance to go down as the greatest college basketball coach of the modern era if he gets out of his magic deal and goes back to gainesville " mr bianchi writes "otherwise hell just be another nba coach with a mediocre team " but the sentinels david whitley says mr donovan shouldnt duck out on the nba "he said he wants to grow as a coach " mr whitley writes "designing a defense for lebron james presents more of a professional challenge than beating mississippi state though im sure donovan would miss that annual mid winter trip to starkville " speaking of lebron seven months ago before the san antonio spurs home opener against the cleveland cavaliers san antonio express news columnist buck harvey wondered what would happen if mr james and the cavs returned for the spurs final home game of the season that may well happen as the spurs take home court advantage into the finals against the cavs winners of four straight to defeat the detroit pistons in the east finals mr harvey is dutifully humble about his lucky guess "this is called a stretch it happens on deadline " that said some of his comments proved prescient "it would be the young commercialized star vs the old anti hype one and now theres a promotional poster ready for production it would show lebron dunking on tim duncan " the photo would come from that regular season home opener after an up and down season that looked lost around the all star break james is getting more love than ever before columnists point to his reaction after cleveland eliminated the pistons at home on saturday as evidence of his selflessness "with praise and exultation raining down from the rafters james first act was to leap into the arms of zydrunas ilgauskas the hulking cleveland center and embrace him for a long long time " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "at a time when he officially had become the centerpiece of the nba james reaction wasnt to stand in the middle of the court roaring arms upraised he found the guy whose heart had been broken back in february when his wife delivered stillborn twins a boy and a girl ilgauskas had to leave the team for a while and the pain has not fully healed " that team first attitude may help explain how mr james lifted a mediocre supporting cast to the finals at age a mediocre eastern conference didnt hurt it took michael jordan seven seasons and scottie pippen while kobe bryant had shaquille oneal that kobe comparison is especially poignant after last weeks wild events when the lakers star asked for a trade then rescinded the request "you dont have to resort to demands for trades or trying to be the general manager in your spare time " paul oberjuerge tells kobe in the los angeles daily news "if you play hard enough smart enough relentlessly enough great things can happen " because of the understandable fear that the best moment of the cavs season has already happened the superior spurs will be favored columnists are already taking note of clevelands celebrations and its sad sports plight no championships since the browns "the city could use the good cheer more than most municipalities " tom knott writes in the washington times "and it can find a modicum of encouragement in the travails of the cavaliers " detroit could use its own good cheer but instead the pistons join the red wings as teams to fall one round short of the finals detroit free press columnist mitch albom was troubled by the defeated players sense of entitlement and superiority even after defeat "it keeps the pistons from being coached it keeps them from embracing a sense of urgency most importantly it keeps them in denial for the future " whats eating chris pronger for the second time in six games the " anaheim ducks defenseman has dealt a blow to the head of an opposing player and left him motionless on the ice this time mr pronger is being suspended for tonights game giving a notable advantage to the ottawa senators down in the stanley cup finals the hit on ottawa center dean mcammond resulted in mr prongers seventh career suspension and just the third suspension in finals history si coms michael farber says this was "the perfect suspension storm " with several factors in addition to justice combining to ensure mr pronger would miss tonights game "game was the first of the finals that was televised on nbc " mr farber writes "and seeing a glassy eyed mcammond prostrate on the ice for a few minutes is hardly the image the nhl wants to show to its audience in the united states " columnists come down hard on the offending defenseman "pronger earned the wrath of the nhl and jeopardized the ducks chances of winning the cup " helene elliott writes in the los angeles times she adds "that blow also cemented prongers reputation as a cheap shot artist a shameful choice for someone who has the talent to be so much better " the toronto stars damien cox says the ducks rough play could be their undoing "if the ducks dont win the stanley cup it wont be because they werent good enough " mr cox writes "it will be because they threw it all away to prove theyre the meanest sobs on the block " cbc commentator don cherry may have something to say about the proper role of hard hits in hockey when he joins tonights broadcast on nbc between periods in the los angeles times joel greenberg profiles and interviews
