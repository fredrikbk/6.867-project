investing in funds a monthly analysis global investing one stop shopping how top managers comb continents to make world stock funds deliver the goods the case for buying a world stock fund is pretty simple the globe is your oyster managers of world stock funds can pool the best ideas of analysts across their firms regardless of where the companies those analysts follow are based in contrast managers at u s focused funds could end up with a second best or even third best idea in their portfolio if the top picks have foreign addresses "why not let a good manager make the decision of which one to buy " says gregg wolper an analyst at chicago based fund tracker morningstar inc owning a world stock fund last year would have paid off for many investors given the strong rallies of many international markets the average world stock fund returned in according to morningstar that was slightly behind the return of morgan stanley capital internationals benchmark world index but it beat the return for an investor who had of savings in the average u s large blend stock fund and in a large blend international fund a common split in particular world funds can be sensible choices for small investors who may not be able to meet the minimum investment requirements for several funds at the same time there are some things to watch for though one of the biggest concerns among financial planners is the overlap that can result from owning a world stock fund along with u s and international stock funds but morningstar analysts note that overlap isnt confined to world stock funds which as a group recently had about of their money invested in u s stocks for example of the funds in morningstars u s large blend category recently had international exposure of or more investors can visit www morningstar com to view a funds biggest holdings also mr wolper cautions that it is important for investors to focus on management style in choosing a world fund at some funds stock picking is split between a u s manager and one focused overseas "that takes away the advantage of one person comparing everything together " he says world funds recommended by morningstar are american funds new

of assets to get a better look at the category we turned to three managers who morningstar says represent different and smart ways of approaching a world fund oliver kratz at dws global thematic bernard horn jr at polaris global value and robert gensler at the t rowe fund mr kratz looks at the globe and sees investment themes not continents mr horn uses proprietary screening software to crunch out the cash flow generating powers of companies in far corners of the world and mr gensler keeps a heavy travel schedule to grill managements world wide about their growth strategies while also drawing on the expertise of a big stable of analysts and portfolio managers mr kratz a managing director at the deutsche asset management unit of deutsche bank ag invests based on about a dozen long term concepts such as "talent and ingenuity " which identifies companies with strong intellectual property and "disequilibria " which identifies producers of "disruptive" technologies or products that challenge existing systems such as radio frequency identification chips replacing bar codes and other older methods of inventory management mr kratz years old works with four analysts who tap into the expertise of the firms investment professionals around the world the dws global thematic funds &# billion in investments are spread across about holdings "i learn by connecting and collecting information and ideas from many different sources " says mr kratz he travels extensively to scour for stocks and new themes visiting as many as companies a year and up to companies a day while he is on the road he also talks constantly to journalists economists regulators and politicians introducing a new theme typically requires as much as six months of research mr kratz and his team compile a shopping list of about companies that might fit potential thematic criteria zeroing in on to for deeper analysis and ultimately settling on eight to for investment themes are based on long term trends such as growing wealth in china and india leading to the revival of the ancient silk road trade route connecting the asian and european continents but "the investment thesis has to materialize" in less than a decade he says adding that a " or year trade is too long " for example he says investing in monsanto co which develops strains of crops that can be converted into ethanol is a good play on the growing demand for alternative fuels but betting on companies whose sales are based largely on preparing for climate change may not be the fund often has larger emerging markets stakes than category rivals mr kratz explains that many of the companies that fit his funds "supply chain dominance" theme happen to be in those economies that theme focuses on businesses such as container terminal operator santos brasil sa gaining market share along the global trade and production supply chain "its the biggest story out there in global economics since the industrial revolution " he says as of march u s shares totaled about a quarter of the funds stock holdings and those from the u k and western europe totaled about among european countries represented were germany switzerland france and sweden about was in japan and other parts of asia represented about the latin american stake stood at about the fund ranked in the top of its morningstar category in and with returns of and respectively at the &# million polaris global value fund stock selection begins with massive data crunching using proprietary software computers continually screen thousands of stocks from around the world zeroing in on free cash flow a measure of a companys available cash currency risk and country specific data like economic growth and demographics are incorporated of the several hundred stocks that emerge from that process as candidates for investment dozens end up in the fund at any one time based on further research they typically span about countries and industries and are held for three to five years "everything we do is focused on cash flow " says mr horn who launched the polaris mutual fund in "our job is to find the most undervalued streams of cash flow in the world and that defines what the best values in the world are " as of dec u s shares totaled about of the stock portfolio mr horn says the u s market is "still dramatically overvalued relative to the rest of the world " noting that the average share price to cash flow multiple in the u s is about compared with nine elsewhere western european and u k stocks totaled about another was in japan and exposure to latin america was among his top picks are miners bhp billiton ltd of australia and impala platinum holdings ltd of south africa mr horns studies at the sloan school of management at the massachusetts institute of technology led him to believe he would have a competitive advantage as an investor if he looked at stocks outside of the u s which was "the most efficient market at the time " less efficient markets tend to create more opportunities to buy undervalued stocks today his polaris capital management inc manages about &# billion overall it remains relatively small with eight investment professionals working with mr horn the fund ranks in the top of the world stock category for the past five years through may with an average a year return like managers at some other world funds offered by big fund firms mr gensler gets a lot of help keeping track of the stocks in the t rowe price global stock portfolio while about of his work time is spent traveling he recently visited companies over four days in japan he also taps t rowe price group inc s analysts and portfolio managers to share ideas the &# million fund adopts a "go anywhere do anything" approach he says meaning it can swing from bargain hunting value mode to scouting for growth stocks of rapidly expanding companies from small to large cap stocks he focuses on measures such as a companys pricing power and expected revenue and earnings growth over one to three years he owns only those stocks he thinks will appreciate at least a year he insists on hearing corporate managements strategies for their businesses and industries and has sold shares if say a ceos budget for research and development isnt as high as he thinks it should be once in real estate development he sees stocks through the prism of that experience "heres the secret sauce " he says "the neighborhood creates the opportunity in a piece of real estate and the industry creates the opportunity in a company but in stock picking change is when you get your opportunities i love things that are changing " of the three managers mr gensler has been most bullish on the u s recently u s shares represented about of the funds stock position as of march shares from the u k and western europe represented about a third the latin america stake stood at about and was in japan the funds relatively large u s allocation stems from his belief that some industries have been hit disproportionately hard by concerns about a slowing economy he thinks that has knocked stock valuations lower than they ought to be for home builders and construction equipment manufacturers among others the fund owns home builders d r horton inc and hovnanian enterprises inc and bulldozer manufacturer caterpillar inc "i dont give two hoots about todays housing starts " he says referring to increasingly bearish government data on house construction "i care about how the stocks will trade in " the funds return of was in the top of the category its trailing month return of puts it in the top and its three year annualized result of lands it in the top ms richardson is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau she can be
