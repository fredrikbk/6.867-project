registers last hurrah to understand the challenge faced by al hurra the u s taxpayer financed arabic tv network consider the case of yasser thabet for years mr thabet has been a leading figure in shaping news coverage in the region whereas fawning over terrorists would be career suicide in the united states mr thabet formerly a broadcast editor at al jazeera did just that and promptly landed a top position at a major arab media outlet last summer mr thabet wrote a loving tribute on his personal web site to soha bechara a woman who attempted to assassinate a general of the main anti hezbollah forces the south lebanese army calling her "a living symbol of lebanese resistance " he encouraged "those who are unfairly and unjustly detained in our arab world" to take solace from her example including tayssir allouni the former al jazeera reporter who was convicted by a spanish court in of passing money between al qaeda and an affiliated cell in spain after the execution of saddam hussein mr thabet unleashed a vitriolic attack on iraqi shiites whom he called "a group of murderers " lamenting that "the execution of saddam was a political and historical mistake " mr thabet wrote fondly about how the "corpse" of saddam had managed "to incite its people to retaliate and resist " a few months later in march of this year mr thabet was hired as chief editor of news by al hurra his employment is just one of a number of recent controversies surrounding the network since the appointment of longtime cnn producer larry register as its news director last november internal al hurra memos and emails show that mr register was directly responsible for most of the broadcasts which provided platforms to holocaust deniers and islamic terrorists that have angered lawmakers the networks oversight panel and the u s state department have nevertheless maintained that the news directors actions on these matters were just "mistakes " but when mr register hired mr thabet he knew exactly what he was getting mr thabet was well known as part of a relatively small group at al jazeera who decided to broadcast osama bin ladens propaganda videos unedited he publicly defended that decision in at a speech at the university of delaware saying simply "its important to hear bin ladens opinions " he told a colorado audience that same year that because some terror arrests were aided by the videos americans should be grateful they were broadcast given his track record it is difficult to imagine a more inappropriate job candidate for al hurra the broadcasting board of governors the congressionally created panel charged with overseeing international broadcasters apparently agreed the bbg learned about mr thabets past shortly before a congressional hearing on may that focused on al hurras new direction by weeks end mr thabet was fired nevertheless mr registers hire of mr thabet has apparently not shaken the bbgs confidence in him as part of a behind the scenes campaign to save his job mr registers backers including members of the bbg have largely based their defense on his record at cnn where he ran the jerusalem bureau from mr registers supporters claim that he was well liked in israel and had a reputation for being balanced those claims do not sit well with some of mr registers former colleagues who say he was known as someone who harbored deep biases against the jewish state and that he often bragged about his close relationships with among others former palestinian leader yasser arafat and syrian dictator bashar assad a half dozen of mr registers former cnn colleagues who agreed to be interviewed for this column share largely similar recollections of his tenure there their statements about mr registers sympathetic attitude toward dictators in the middle east and elsewhere are also corroborated by independent evidence including emails written by mr register himself mr register has declined more than five requests for an interview between february and last week the latest rebuff coming despite the appearance of two articles about him by me in the wall street journal inside of mr registers current al hurra office say several al hurra employees who have seen them there are on display two photos of him with political figures one is with the very noncontroversial queen noor of jordan the other is with the syrian despot president bashar al assad "having a photo with al assad signaled to the entire newsroom where his sympathies lie " one al hurra insider said while he was cnns vice president of special projects a producer suggested that cnn "may not be balanced in terms of the kind of coverage were providing" by failing to do human interest stories on the suffering of israelis mr register responded in an email on may that "balance is difficult in this story because it is a completely out of balance story " in his five paragraph note mr register wrote that " of the palestinians want to live in peace with israel as their neighbor " this claim is startling repeated polling throughout early found strong majority support by palestinians for suicide bombings echoing a longtime palestinian liberation organization argument that attacks against jewish settlers in the west bank and gaza arent actually terrorism mr register also wrote that "settlers do live under daily threat but this is the life they choose not the one they have to live " mr register added "in israel proper it would not be responsible to do a story of israelis living under daily threats of violence " this was "because it is not the daily reality " that would have been news to israelis who at the time of mr registers email had already been subject to a dozen recent terrorist attacks dotting the landscape in "israel proper" from northern israel to the tel aviv area to jerusalem in all had been killed in those attacks and over injured mr register still seems to be toeing the plo party line last month on may al hurras onscreen ticker referred to the establishment of the modern state of israel in as "al naqba " which in arabic means "the catastrophe " when mr register was informed of this that in effect al hurra was taking a pro palestinian position absolutely not shared by the u s government that funds the network he said to employees in the newsroom that it was appropriate since its the term used by arabs the ticker was eventually changed but only after an hour had passed mr register has assured congress that he is committed to fair coverage of israel yet those assurances should be considered alongside his view of the feb riots that occurred just outside the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem despite widespread agreement in the western media that the riots were started by muslims mr register was convinced that israel was the instigator and he was determined to catch the jewish state in the act the following friday he wrote an email to al hurra staff saying that he wanted a satellite truck "in place to get people turned away from prayers if the israelis do this again " muslim men under had been turned away from the mosque on feb in order to limit the scope of violent riots that palestinians had already hinted were coming but so too were jews praying at the nearby western wall removed from the area this week the house panel responsible for funding the state department and all international broadcasters takes up its fiscal year spending bill nine of the members of the appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations have already demanded that mr registers employment be terminated and now they have an opportunity to hand state and the bbg an ultimatum so mr registers defenders should ask themselves is it worth risking millions to save someone with so dubious a track record mr mowbray is a writer
