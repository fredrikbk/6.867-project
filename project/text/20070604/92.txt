small business link internships help firm find the right fit mill steel co had plenty of job candidates knocking on its door the problem most werent the kind the steel processor wanted the company would get flooded with a motley stream of resumes from online job ads when it wanted driven entry level workers who would learn the business and stay for the long haul but four years ago that changed thanks to a partnership with nearby grand valley state university in which the company provides paid semester long internships for students and works with business classes on company projects during those stints mill steel gets to determine if the interns have what it takes to stay with the firm long term and move up its ranks meantime word about the company spreads through campus raising its cachet among students each internship is like "a three month interview " says tom stanfield director of people development at mill steel which employs people in four michigan locations and sells steel parts to auto companies and office furniture manufacturers before the program started mr stanfield adds he had to interview times as many candidates before finding the right person seventy percent of the interns accept full time jobs with the firm after graduation finding job candidates who are the right fit and and stick around is a common problem among small businesses often people especially younger workers starting out will take job at a small firm to get experience and then move on and of course companies dont really know if people will work out until they hire them but mill steels intern strategy shows how zeroing in on a locale for specific talent and giving them a shot to show their mettle can pay off small firms "have a tremendous opportunity with young people that they dont know they have " says kevin wheeler president and founder of global learning resources inc a recruitment consulting firm in fremont calif they need to "figure out how theyre going to make the students aware they exist " given michigans high unemployment rate mr stanfield always received lots of responses to ads he placed on careerbuilder com and local online job sites but he found himself "wading through volumes of resumes" to find the handful that fit his parameters then in troy farley an assistant director in grand valleys career services office approached a mill steel executive who lived down the street from him and suggested a partnership mill steel would offer a semester long internship program promoted by grand valleys career services office and grand valley would help brand the company on campus bringing executives into classes mr farley says he wanted to offer more job opportunities to graduates of grand valley a mostly commuter state school with about undergraduates and two campuses in the grand rapids area students often think theyll graduate and secure jobs with large well known companies but "that just isnt the case " he says students "dont understand the value of working at a small or medium size organization " he says mr stanfield says gauging a potential employees skills through an internship "gives us much better information than trying to read somebodys life story on a resume " mill steels recruiting efforts include having company executives be guest lecturers in classes at grand valleys business school the company also hosts periodic open houses for students at its grand rapids office and it enlists marketing students to administer its annual customer survey all this allows the company to get to know students who can in turn judge if mill steel is the type of company they would want to work for by the end of each semester working with a class "we know who the shining stars are " mr stanfield says during the first year of the partnership mill steel hired three interns at &# per hour one stayed on as a full time employee the following year it hired several more currently the company hires six to interns each semester and about a quarter of its employees are former interns over time mr stanfield has learned to give interns assignments that can gauge their abilities and potential "you build the internship with mile markers " he says "if they cant get to a certain level by a certain time you realize that you dont have the right person " on occasion he says interns will have some difficulties one former accounting intern he recalls couldnt put together a spreadsheet for customer credit collections "it happens once in a while where its not their natural thing " he says "its better than taking a job and quitting in six months " others fit right in brandon wilcox worked as an intern in after graduating a year later the engineer joined as a full time employee mr wilcox says he also interviewed with a major auto maker but found the company to be "high stress" compared with mill steel which he says has a community feel "i pretty much brag about how solid this company is how stable " he says striking up a relationship with local schools can make sense for firms without the means to travel to dozens of college career fairs or the cachet to make students swarm to their booths says mr wheeler of global learning resources he suggests focusing on state schools or smaller universities where there may be less competition for talent "hold a free seminar on campus " he says "run an ad on the campus intranet " despite its success at grand valley mill steel has had difficulty duplicating its recruitment strategy at other area universities mr stanfield says he has tried to reach out to officials at five other schools but they werent as receptive the key to getting the right fit he says is finding a career services office thats willing to work with you and help establish the company on campus
