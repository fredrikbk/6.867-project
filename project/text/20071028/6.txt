love &amp money my son the stock market maven for a while ive been wondering when to begin passing my knowledge on to my son i want him to learn about the benefits of investing much earlier than i did so he can begin building wealth at a younger age but i also realize this hes just a kid years old and concepts like price earnings ratios and dividend yields will put him to sleep it puts most adults to sleep so as i launch my son into the world of stocks and bonds i have a goal that is both simple and complex i want to make wall street fun i see a lot of financial basket cases in my reporting so many americans are well schooled in the art of spending but hopeless when it comes to saving and investing for the future i want my son to be different early on my wife amy and i began introducing him to financial concepts in an effort to make him comfortable with money since that isnt a life skill most schools teach we started with his allowance and when he was we added an account at a bank where kids dump pocket change into a coin counting machine most recently weve insisted that he deposit part of his allowance at the bank so that hes accustomed to saving a meaningful part of his income and learning to prioritize his spending investing is the next logical step but when to leap it turns out he made the call for me while running errands recently he asked me "when can i buy some stock " "whenever you want " i replied "mom and i have &# to put into an account for you whenever youre ready " "can i buy some today " later that afternoon i opened a custodial account at an online brokerage firm that has an office in our hometown since i want him to physically deposit money on occasion and because the storefront when we pass it will remind him of investing just like that he was ready to own his little piece of america of course i didnt let him loose on his own on wall street first im trying to teach him how wall street works without scaring him with some of the mind numbing details and jargon that scare many adults away from investing he doesnt need to understand the inner workings yet he just needs to see the link between the stock market and his everyday life last friday my son and i were leaving the doctors office when a kansas city southern train rumbled past "see that train " i pointed "mom and i own a tiny piece of it " moments later i pointed out a gamestop store where my son loves to peruse new videogames "you can buy stock in them if you want to " i told him i pointed out home depot and target where we shop mcdonalds and sonic where he grabs burgers i mentioned electronic arts which makes many of the videogames he plays and disney i pointed to a plane from american airlines which we fly regularly and when he was eating rice krispies i noted that he can buy a piece of kelloggs basically i want him to know that investing is no more complex than owning pieces of the companies you do business with every day and that some of the dollars we spend come back to us in the form of higher stock prices or a dividend check he likes the idea of a company sending him money while some of these companies are better investments than others ive decided not to steer him toward any in particular i want him to buy based on his own thinking and based on his rudimentary analysis of mcdonalds "there are lot of people in the drive through every time were here so theyre probably making a lot of money huh " i have confidence in his abilities besides this way hes personally vested in a company not tangentially tied because i pushed him into shares i might think are better but which hes not really into so im putting together for him a list of publicly traded companies we deal with as a family since he knows from his own experiences the companies on my list he will instinctively understand their businesses making it that much easier for me to explain how the familys spending affects the shares hes interested in buying well be going through his account statement every month to show him how stock prices move ill clip news items about his companies and show him the effects these events have on his shares no doubt hes still going to prefer to spend money on a videogame than the videogame maker but at least now its a close call jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
