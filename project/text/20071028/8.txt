small business four danger signals when franchising not long after randy richey signed a franchise agreement to open three tanning salons in things started going awry his costs to build a salon in centerville va ran about &# more than the &# he was led to believe he says and his two other planned franchises were put into default before construction had even begun mr richey feels he was wronged by the franchiser planet beach franchising an attorney for planet beach says mr richey had problems because he hired an outside construction firm instead of using the one planet beach recommended and didnt break ground on his last two franchises on the agreed schedule in retrospect mr richey says he should have done more due diligence before signing the franchise agreement "i didnt look at it in terms of what things could go bad because i never thought things could go bad " he says like mr richey many people buy franchises thinking theyre a carefree alternative to starting a business from scratch but while a franchise can indeed include fewer uncertainties there are also big risks franchisees rely heavily on the franchiser for support training and information and things can get testy or downright nasty if the franchise isnt as lucrative as expected or promised the best defense when considering a franchise opportunity carefully read the franchise disclosure document or uniform franchise offering circular which must be provided by the franchiser at least two weeks before a franchise agreement is signed also call current and former franchisees and have a lawyer review all documents before you sign on the dotted line here are some red flags to watch out for along the way  lots of litigation and closures the offering circular which is being renamed the franchise disclosure document is packed with information to help assess the offer including backgrounds of the company executives bankruptcies ongoing royalties and start up costs franchisees will pay earnings claims and other financial information but two pieces of information are particularly useful franchisers must list all the litigation theyve been involved with over the past years a lot of litigation especially a suit that several franchisees have joined means a number of franchisees have been disgruntled enough to take action says stephen story a franchise lawyer in norfolk va another number to check the percentage of franchises that have closed or been sold back to the franchiser in the past five years a total rate of more than or in one year could mean many franchisees became disgruntled or unprofitable you should also compare the start up costs franchise fees and ongoing royalties charged by the franchise to other similar franchises by checking their offering circulars  too many bad reviews interview at least a dozen current and former franchisees preferably more the disclosure documents provided by the franchiser must include a list of all current franchisees in your state along with all franchisees whove terminated canceled or not renewed their franchise agreements in the most recent fiscal year make sure that some of the current and former franchisees you call are in your geographic area ask how responsive the franchiser has been to questions and problems and how much support the franchiser has provided in marketing help and supplies also inquire how profitable the franchises have been compared with the franchisees original expectations one bad review of course may just be a case of sour grapes but if you receive a handful of bad or lukewarm reviews or little commentary at all you might want to rethink the offer says mark siebert chief executive of ifranchise group a homewood ill franchise consulting firm "if those franchisees were surprised with the negative results that they achieved then you likely will be too " he says  high pressure sales tactics its a bad sign if the franchiser pressures you to buy quickly says mario herman an adamstown md lawyer who represents franchisees a franchiser might for instance tell prospective franchisees they have a short window of time before the current franchise offer expires or ask for a down payment to hold a particular location "you should not have any money exchange before you have time to fully review the offer " mr herman says  ambiguous termination clauses what happens if your franchise fails three years into your year franchise agreement you better know the answer before you sign sometimes the franchise agreement explicitly lays out the termination procedures but other times the terms are ambiguous or even very unfavorable some franchisers have sued former franchisees to collect future royalties or tried to prevent them from running a similar business anywhere near where the franchise was located mr herman says kelly spors covers small business for the wall street journal email kelly spors wsj com
