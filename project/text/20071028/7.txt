real time one familys e commerce sorting through a years receipts reveals how much spending has migrated online online edition last week amazon com reported a gain in revenue to &# billion and my first reaction was "well i did my part " over the last couple of years ive come to consider amazon a px of sorts its the default place i buy books electronics tech gear and housewares our neighbor whose being home during the day makes her our buildings de facto postmistress and therefore extremely powerful is used to the parade of boxes with arrows so presumably are the guys on the garbage trucks who cart away the recycling on wednesday mornings i suspect amazons increasing presence in my household is a microcosm of its rise in general amazons beachhead was books which my wife emily and i buy too many of and there it won us over by being cheaper than our local bookstores letting us shop at our leisure and delivering reliably from that starting point weve slowly but surely followed amazons lead into other areas its third party sales and marketplace program helped i now buy the vast majority of my used books from amazon affiliated sellers though some of those sales replace new books i might have bought from amazon itself my decision more than a year ago to get amazon prime in which two day shipping is free has proved self justifying encouraging me to recoup primes &# a year cost by turning to amazon for more and more things finally i started using amazons wish list as a way to note books i read about and find interesting for myself or our four year old son instead of forgetting i can use my wish list to spot a paperback release a good deal on a used copy or indulge my own whim that said its faintly embarrassing to think i turn to one retailer for so many different things amid the digital age and all its wonders i sometimes feel more like a prairie settler who buys everything from the general store than the shopper i was before e commerce when bookstores and music shops were a regular part of my rounds so just how much were we contributing to amazon anyway i went through my order history and discovered that in the last year or so ive spent &# with amazon not all of that money went to the retailer i frequently order from marketplace sellers who give amazon a cut of the proceeds doing the math however i discovered third parties got just &# of that amazon spending along with &# in shipping which is an important way such sellers eke out a profit as i explored in this column items sold by third parties arent eligible for amazon prime i was surprised that third parties were such a small share of my amazon spending until i realized my third party purchases are mostly used books and cds with more expensive items typically bought from amazon itself by the way i spent &# with amazons overseas divisions in this day and age theres no reason to wait for something to be published in the u s amazon doesnt play as big a role in my wife emilys retail life but she spent &# herself our total amazon spending over the last months &# honestly i thought it would be more so that led me to a bigger question how does our amazon spending compare to our overall e commerce spending time to bust out the credit card statements and a lot of furrowing the brow trying to remember whether various transactions had been consummated by handing over a credit card by or entering numbers and hitting "submit " the e commerce tally for a year best i could reckon &# my first reaction was unprintable clearly our credit cards should be taken away and we should be locked up for our own protection lest we wind up in debtors prison but when i started looking deeper i decided the situation wasnt quite so dire and realized that my familys online shopping habits had changed without my noticing for one thing while i think of myself as more wired than my wife nicknamed "analog girl" for her stubborn adherence to old ways the numbers say otherwise emilys e commerce spending easily topped mine &# compared with &# but if you think the rest of this column is going to be some cyber update of "the honeymooners " not so fast of our e commerce spending &# was for travel covering airline tickets car rentals and ez pass fees sounds exotic but most of it was family visits along with a couple of weekly car rentals for two jersey shore getaways since we dont have a car our travel costs are higher and e commerce accounts for a disproportionate share of them we spent &# on food most of it groceries from fresh direct which delivers most every sunday clothes mostly workplace staples and new things for our always growing boy cost &# emily does most of the shopping for travel food and apparel which explained her higher e commerce spending we spent &# via e commerce on housewares and used the net to give &# to charity subtracting our brief vacations about half of our e commerce spending was directed toward keeping our household running and visiting family that made me feel a little better granted that left plenty of spending and some more surprises for example i like to think im a digital music convert who scorns cds but between itunes emusic and amazon i only spent &# on downloads my emusic subscription does allow downloads a month but i didnt always use them all physical cds are only used for ripping mps now but they remain a bigger part of my music consumption than i thought on the other hand i collect all sorts of dorky junk as confessed ages ago here and that costs more than id imagined &# baseball which emily and i both love is expensive we paid &# for tickets to see the brooklyn cyclones and new york mets which makes me even more bitter about the latters september collapse emily uses shutterfly to print out lots of snapshots and to make gifts for our grandchild adoring parents those added up to &# and then there were the gadgets as previously chronicled here and here thanks to an unexpected windfall this was the year we took the hdtv plunge i knew that had led to a burst in spending but i hadnt realized just how much our gadget bill for the last months was a whopping &# thats unlikely to be repeated thank goodness but maybe that new imac will have to wait as for amazon its share of our e commerce spending turned out to be impressive but not quite the general store id imagined why did i overestimate amazons share because those boxes bring the things i look forward to most books dvds and the from now on occasional gadget but i also hadnt realized just how much of our spending has shifted to the internet and how inevitably thats made e commerce so mundane that id underestimated how much we buy online i now rarely go to bookstores shop for cds in actual stores or scour real world haunts for collectibles but i also dont go to the grocery store the travel agent or the ticket window at shea stadium and perhaps one of these days ill get it through my skull that someone who dresses almost exclusively from the gap old navy banana republic axis can buy clothes online too instead of going out to buy what we need my wife and i increasingly bring retailers to us by firing up our browsers whenever parenthood and our jobs leave us with a couple of spare minutes that no longer seems extraordinary and that might be the most extraordinary thing of all how have your e commerce habits changed are there things you buy online that you thought would remain offline purchases what would it take for you to make greater use of e commerce join me and other online journal readers in
