eyes on the road paving the way for new sales auto industry talks about safer cleaner cars but also better highways to lift demand online edition toyota motor corp chief executive officer katsuaki watanabe says his dream car is a vehicle "that can make the atmosphere clean a vehicle that can never injure people can never cause accidents and can go around the globe on a tank of gas " but while we wait mr watanabe has something else on his agenda building more highways in japan in japan he explains during a meeting with reporters on the sidelines of the tokyo motor show highways are so jammed that "people may realize cars are not needed in downtown areas " sales of new cars in japan have declined by million vehicles or about since turned off by the hassle of driving in japans congested cities many consumers are shifting to tiny microcars or simply going without a car japan is the auto industrys nightmare scenario come to life "we have to make these highways true highways where people can speed up " mr watanabe says beyond that mr watanabe says cities need to create more parking spaces more roads and more parking spaces in japan could "revive demand for larger cars we havent given up " as for who should pay for this highway construction mr watanabe says "we need the support of the government " in other words taxpayers it may sound contradictory for mr watanabe to call for pollution free cars in one breath and in the next plump for more highway subsidies to encourage sales of larger cars but thats the way things are in the car business right now the tokyo motor show which opened to the public over the weekend offered the customary displays of japanese techno goofiness highlighted by mr watanabes entrance to toyotas big press conference at the helm of a concept electric "personal mobility" vehicle called the "i real " which looked for all the world like a wheelchair expropriated from the star trek museum the official theme of the tokyo show was "catch the news touch the future " with an emphasis on sustainable mobility the underlying vibe was cognitive dissonance nissan motor corp exemplified the shows split personality on one side of the stage at nissans show booth there was the pivo a futuristic concept for an electric car with a cabin and wheels that could pivot so drivers never had to turn their heads to back up on the other side of the stage was a car nissan actually intends to sell the nissan gt r a nearly horsepower gas chugging machine with a tail fin on the back "people love it " says nissan chief executive carlos ghosn says of the gt r at the same time mr ghosn says nissan and its french alliance partner renault sa are pushing to develop commercially viable electric vehicles for sale by mr ghosn who also runs renault says he has concluded that big cities such as paris and london will eventually forbid all but "zero emission" vehicles in their centers when people come under pressure in their lives their responses can be contradictory and confused whats so different about large auto companies which after all are nothing but collections of individuals struggling to balance short term and long term interests toyotas mr watanabe has a particularly difficult challenge on his watch as ceo toyota has achieved its goal of becoming nearly as large as general motors corp in terms of vehicles sold world wide and is much larger than gm in terms of market capitalization but with greater power comes greater responsibility and greater scrutiny toyotas decision to push its gas electric hybrid prius in the u s market over the initial skepticism of some american executives has proven to be a master stroke now toyota is getting flak from the u s green community because it has joined the detroit three in opposing some of the more aggressive proposals for boosting u s fuel economy standards mr watanabe may dream of cars powered by fuel cells that require only cleanly produced hydrogen for fuel but toyotas profits in the current year depend in part on convincing americans to buy more v powered tundra pickups and sequioa sport utility vehicles toyota has an eight story building in its headquarters complex in toyota city japan devoted to research on advanced batteries and fuel cells the company spends a massive trillion yen a year &# billion on research and development for new models and new technology but the companys executives are still fundamentally conservative particularly in the wake of a recent rash of quality problems various upstart organizations and companies in the u s say they have developed systems for using lithium ion batteries to extend the all electric range of the prius hybrid system but senior executives in charge of toyotas advanced vehicle efforts say they arent going to rush to deploy their own lithium ion battery systems for plug in hybrids and they say the costs of all electric vehicles are still too high fuel cells probably not before and then in limited quantities toyota executives say toyotas leaders get the same muddled signals from consumers around the world as their rivals people say they love the prius for its fuel efficiency and then suggest to toyotas marketers that it would be even better if it had a faster time people say they want fuel efficient cars but cling to the notion that larger more powerful cars should command a higher more profitable price mr watanabe and toyota may have made some good calls during the last few years but thats no assurance the future wont jump them tomorrow just as it has in japan send
