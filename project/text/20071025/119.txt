progress in california fires as winds die down fighters get a break quest for new tactics firefighters began to gain an upper hand over californias wildfires even as a region bracing for more frequent destructive blazes sought new tactics for combating them the fires which began sunday and wreaked havoc in seven southern california counties have so far destroyed homes charred nearly acres and temporarily displaced more than a half million residents relentlessly gusting winds which earlier this week both fanned the flames and made them difficult to fight died down yesterday giving firefighters a chance to make significant progress in containing them so far economic damage caused by the wildfires is modest relative to the nations worst natural disasters including hurricane katrina in and the northridge calif earthquake in in large part because the blazes havent hit dense urban areas or major infrastructure in san diego county the hardest hit region officials estimated the fires have caused about &# billion in damage but moodys economy com estimated that property damage from lost homes throughout the region was much lower putting it between &# million and &# million amid sniping among some local governments over access to firefighting resources california gov arnold schwarzenegger has traveled from one fire command post to the next carrying an upbeat message of government cooperation across federal state and local lines he has gone out of his way to praise president bush and other federal officials for their quick response to his aid requests inviting comparisons to the administrations failures after katrina mr schwarzenegger brushed aside questions suggesting that some communities were unprepared or that fire fighting resources might be deployed unequally southern californias predicament is serving as a proving ground for emerging high tech methods from satellites to pilotless aircraft aimed at helping fire officials better predict track and fight blazes researchers around the u s are stepping up work on such techniques some climatologists and fire researchers see trends they believe are likely to increase the frequency and duration of wildfires one recent study of national forest land in arizona for instance concluded that encroaching development and other factors have make certain trees more susceptible to large scale high intensity fires dar roberts a geography professor at the university of california at santa barbara has developed innovative ways to gauge the potential for devastating outbreaks using satellite data the goal is to assess moisture content and the proportion of live vs dead vegetation in fire prone areas mr roberts also is working on a new system combining such detailed information with high atmosphere weather patterns and he is experimenting with infrared ground sensors to measure the intensity of fires some of his analysis of california shrubs was used in developing strategies to fight fires in the state earlier this year unmanned aircraft increasingly are being deployed to assist in emergencies the national aeronautics and space administration yesterday flew a version of the militarys predator drone equipped with special heat measuring sensors to help fire commanders predict and allocate resources cruising at feet and skirting densely populated areas to comply with federal air safety restrictions the predator was able to transmit digital images to fire command posts in five or minutes regular surveillance aircraft are scarce and getting information from them to fire commanders often can take many hours by which time conditions can dramatically worsen when used earlier this summer to track fires in the west according to brent cobleigh one of the projects managers the predators images surprised fire commanders by revealing the spread of some blazes long before they could be detected by ground crews the national weather service is improving the effectiveness of so called incident meteorologists forecasters sent to the fire lines to anticipate violent local winds or minitornadoes of flame often spawned by large blazes nine such forecasters are working in southern california equipped with lightweight satellite dishes in the future they also will have electronic surveying equipment able to measure high level wind by tracking balloons launched from fire lines even as the region prepares to better fight fires it must grapple with another issue how to rebuild in areas that are clearly fire prone some areas devastated by the fires rebounded vigorously as residents not only rebuilt their homes in high risk areas but built bigger homes the upscale scripps ranch development in san diego suffered the heaviest losses four years ago when more than homes were destroyed it was in the fire path again this year although evacuees were allowed to return to their homes on tuesday resident pascale fougeres says all but one of the scripps ranch homes lost in have been rebuilt whereas many homes in the area had been between square feet and square feet after the fire several square foot houses rose from charred lots tougher building codes since the fires have given some added protection for instance in scripps ranch homes that previously had highly flammable shingle roofs now must have tiles or concrete amid widespread predictions for more devastating wildfires in the future some homeowners may be attracted to personal security services to supplement public fire department services two years ago american international group inc the new york financial services company developed a wildfire protection product as part of an insurance program for homeowners with multimillion dollar properties the coverage which can run as much as double the cost of traditional insurance includes the service of a "rapid response unit" that is automatically dispatched to a home threatened by wildfire this week aig said it has had six trucks spraying fire retardant on clients homes in southern california
