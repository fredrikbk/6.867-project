the daily fix red sox flatten the rockies behind a dominant beckett online edition welcome to fenway park colorado rockies now duck game of the world series was a rout the boston red sox pancaked the rockies buffeting starter jeff francis six runs in five innings from dustin pedroias leadoff homer onward and then demolishing the rockies bullpen for seven in the fifth youkilis double ortiz double ramirez single lowell double varitek walk drew single exit franklin morales enter ryan speier lugo walk ellsbury walk pedroia walk exit mr speier possibly to hide under his hotel room bed enter matt herges youkilis pop out to right yes all that came with two outs it was enough to leave rockies fans muttering about that eight day layoff and perhaps worrying that while the rockies did win an incredible of before game not one of those games came against a team like boston "well then that was just about the worst case scenario wasnt it " writes dan lucero on the blog up in the rockies adding "as much as wed rather not have admitted it the day layoff clearly had an effect on the sharpness of colorados hitters and pitchers alike the rockies lineup as a whole was behind josh becketts heat all night and every pitch francis and company threw to red sox hitters lacked life and precision i had figured the rox would have some rust but this wasnt rust this was a sunken cruise liner after a week at the bottom of the ocean " the loss which only counted for one game in the series despite the ugly final score seems to have put colorado columnists on the defensive the denver posts mark kiszla begins by talking about the very rich and comparing team payrolls before invoking previous humiliations "sure the best of seven series is a long way from being over but this was the worst beatdown on national television for a denver sports team since the broncos went to super bowl xxiv and all they got was a lousy t shirt not to mention a heaping helping of humiliation served by the san francisco ers while manny was being manny and boston played bingo bango bongo off the famous left field wall did anyone else have a bad rocky mountain flashback to super joe montana " bernie lincicome of the rocky mountain news meanwhile launches an inexplicable attack on fenway which he writes "squats in disjointed immunity to the present tense having convinced new englanders that being too small too ugly and too weird is nevertheless as a banner proclaims americas most beloved ballpark " after calling it an "absurd little tenement by the turnpike " mr lincicome then writes that "coloradans may not be able to appreciate the local fascination for this analog woodpile having a much more digital fenway of their own named after a beer but with more comfortable seats and better food if no more convenient or cheaper parking " um ok his colleague dave krieger is more clear eyed drily observing that "on the bright side that should probably take care of the debate about which team is hotter the kid rocks have now won of on the other hand the red sox have won four in a row by a combined score of since the rocks last won including wednesdays head to head verdict so they may have the momentum " mr krieger doesnt fret about mr franciss poor outing or mr becketts great one but the battering suffered by the rockies young relievers does worry him particularly since tonights starter ubaldo jimenez is a year old rookie "morales looked very much like a pitcher rushed to the major leagues from double a tulsa not the surprisingly mature year old that pitched to a era in eight major league starts during the regular season " mr krieger writes "his world series era might be useful as a halloween mask speier too looked like a minor league pitcher dropped into the world series as some sort of practical joke " on the boston side well whats not to like the struggles of the sox are remembered with something close to nostalgia "remember when there was genuine concern about the red sox lineup " jackie macmullan asks in the boston globe "remember when folks were legitimately fretting that this team couldnt hit you are forgiven if you cant recall those sentiments were a lifetime ago that deficit to cleveland in the american league championship series nine days ago caused in part by a sox power outage is a hazy memory a vague recollection like those old time grainy black and white films you strain to follow on espn classic " the rockies refused to blame their poor showing on that extended layoff with manager clint hurdle saying firmly that "were a no excuses team " thats admirable but in the washington post thomas boswell isnt so diplomatic and puts the blame where it belongs "bud selig and top executive bob dupuy need to do an immediate rethink on their well intentioned brainchild one that turned out to be a frankenstein in game " he writes adding "the games top executives created extra days off in october to generate a more lucrative tv package and produce more prime time exposure especially mid week instead they turned game into must not see tv this calamitous contraption needs to die a sudden and private death as soon as possible because what happened to the colorado rockies was an embarrassment to the institution of the world series and to the dignity of the game " on sunday the new york giants will play the miami dolphins at wembley stadium which means theres a foot tall animated statue of dolphins defensive end jason taylor wandering around london not on its own its being ferried from place to place by forklift that would be pretty scary otherwise leaving aside the question of whether what the dolphins do on the field each sunday counts as football the new york daily newss filip bondy wonders what exactly the nfl hopes to accomplish "there appears no real point to the nfls half hearted toe in the door visit to wembley stadium other than to say it was there " he writes "the giants will spend minimal time in london they will arrive early friday morning terminal at heathrow airport they will practice for two hours that afternoon with limited player and coach availability to the media on the practice field on saturday at noon there will be a walk through at wembley with no interviews then theres a game against the miami dolphins on sunday a brief farewell conference on monday morning at a hotel and a flight back to new york wham bam thank you queen elizabeth " in the miami herald greg cote checks in with restaurateur eddie irwin the president of dolfans u k "imagine being in an american sports bar on a super bowl sunday and being the one evangelist handing out leaflets on why soccer is a better sport " asks mr cote "welcome to eddies world oh he still loves englands football its his blood chelsea is his team but he loves the dolphins in a way even many dolfans dont and his love is shared by the or so members of his club the ones who travel to miami for games when they can the ones who are treating this weeks game at wembley like a local catholic church might regard a visit by the pope " the fix will stick with the herald for basketball and dan le batard who weighs in on the heats trade of unhappy well paid forward antoine walker along with michael doleac wayne simien and a conditional first round pick in to the minnesota timberwolves for ricky david and mark blount mr le batard makes much of mr walkers struggles with conditioning which earned him a four game suspension last season "the miami heat is literally in better shape today than it was yesterday " he writes "so thats the good but miami is not better than it was a few months ago thats the bad " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your
