the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources health are there really two types of diabetes patients who have an odd mixture of symptoms from both kinds of diabetes are leading some scientists to rethink dividing the disease into two forms reports journalist jo whelan both types of the disease stem from problems with the amount of insulin in the body in type diabetes which most often is diagnosed during childhood the bodys immune system attacks insulin producing cells in the pancreas in type diabetes which is linked to obesity the body slowly becomes resistant to insulin the second type can usually be managed by diet although insulin injections can eventually become necessary there have been many cases of children with type later developing type diabetes but recently doctors have come across patients with more surprising combinations of the symptoms for instance some middle age obese adults with classic type diabetes symptoms show signs of a type immune attack on the pancreas diabetes researchers debate the significance of the condition variously called mixed double hybrid or type diabetes some see it as a reminder that the types are labels of convenience and that doctors should tailor treatments to each patient rather than fall back on an either or approach more controversially terence wilkin of the peninsula medical school in the united kingdom says the two types could reflect the same disease progressing at different speeds he thinks both types of diabetes start by weight gain with genetic differences determining at what point an individuals immune system attacks the insulin producing cells dr wilkin speculates that even a small gain in weight in children might be enough to trigger diabetes dr wilkins theory would explain mixed diabetes and an otherwise baffling rise in type diabetes but others point to some difficulties with the theory edwin gale of the university of bristol in the u k says recent genetic tests on diabetes sufferers suggest that the two types arent manifestations of the single condition new scientist oct law holding third parties liable can do more harm than good should hosts at a party be held liable if they serve alcohol to guests who go on to crash their cars under the influence this could be a rare instance where it makes sense for the law to go beyond the person who directly inflicted an injury and punish someone who failed to prevent it writes u s circuit judge richard posner on his blog the type of person who is unwise enough to drive a car while drunk isnt likely to respond rationally to deterrents on the other hand hosts and bartenders are in the same way that parents are held responsible for their childrens actions it is sometimes effective to put pressure on rational people to ensure that irrational people fall into line but in most cases so called third party liability causes more harm than good says mr posner an influential legal theorist to use mr posners example punishing a strong swimmer for not trying to rescue a drowning person at a beach would only deter strong swimmers from going to beaches mr posners sparring partner on the blog economist gary becker agrees that third party liability laws make sense in only a few cases such as holding corporations accountable for injuries caused by their employees while on the job but he doubts that holding social hosts liable for drunk drivers is efficient because it imposes too many costs on hosts and bar owners for the amount of drunken driving it would stop a more sensible solution would be to impose tougher legal penalties on people who are caught drinking and driving mr becker says the recent chicago marathon where hundreds of marathoners fell ill from heat induced dehydration is a good example of a case when third parties shouldnt be held liable because the runners were as informed about the weather as the organizers and sponsors the becker posner blog oct society dallas hopes mans law
