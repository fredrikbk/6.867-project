wonder land rudy one school of thought on the religious right holds that if rudy giuliani would commit to an unequivocal anti abortion position they could vote for him a second school of thought articulated by richard land a leading figure in the politically important southern baptist convention is that he wont vote for any pro choice candidate "as a matter of personal moral conscience " though mr land says other evangelicals might find a way to vote for mr giuliani among the reasons politicians such as mr giuliani are sensitive to this issue was the revelation from exit polls after the election that values and morals ranked high among voters concerns thus this past weekend the very conservative family research council pointedly named its washington convocation the "values voter summit " into this den of reproach stepped rudy giuliani on saturday dragging various balls and chains liberal "social" beliefs three marriages alienated children new york city no matter that ronald reagan had two marriages alienated children hollywood pals and live and let live social views a straw poll taken after the candidates speeches put mr giuliani next to dead last before john mccain but well behind the attendees top choice former baptist minister and future talk show star mike huckabee the focus here is on the speech mr giuliani delivered to the values summit hes the front runner hes the candidate who somehow has to get people like these evangelicals to decide whether votes in a presidential election ought to be cast for one or two issues or for a governing philosophy then theres the little matter of the candidates character call me old fashioned but i think governing philosophy is more important than the endless chinese puzzle of moving this or that issue forward and back american politics right and left has become obsessive about nailing where candidates "stand" on standalone issues abortion gay marriage immigration the north pole melting or pulling out of iraq trying to pin politicians down is honest work but last time i looked the thing you win was still called a "government " that means it matters if the candidate is able to govern which has proven a challenge the past years or so in part because proliferating factions refuse to be governed in the s the left introduced the "non negotiable demand" into our politics its still with us its political infantilism in real life the non negotiable "demand" usually ends about age six of necessity mr giuliani has to get voters on the right past this narrowed focus adult politics though runs in both directions rudy has to move toward them too and believably mr giuliani didnt mention abortion and adoption until deep into the talk he began by laying down a personal marker "i cant be all things to all people im just not like that i cant do that " this opened the door a crack on the man behind the grand smile he needs to do more of that why in a moment but his case against issues pandering is one of the better ive heard "for me to twist myself all up to try to figure out exactly what you want to hear and today say one thing and the next day another thing if you do that too long you lose the sense of what leadership is all about " then came the admission of their political legitimacy and in a way theyd get he told them that people of faith "should not be marginalized" in public debates the "religious right" knows exactly what this means this is what was at issue when this movement erupted at the gop convention in houston back in the no apologies belligerence of the christian right began then because they were marginalized even mocked by the national press corps in houston mr giuliani however didnt exploit their enduring sense of alienation from the media instead he argued with some force that their ideas deserved a seat at the national table he didnt promise triumph but he offered respect the speechs big set up theme was "responsibility " every right carries a duty and every benefit brings an obligation his argument to them was a "culture of personal responsibility" enhances both accountability and self respect and these in turn will result in less of the things that drive the evangelicals nuts to the extent any politician can make it sound as if he actually believes this stuff mr giuliani does still theres a problem "responsibility" was a main theme of bill clintons inaugural speech we believed him a wall street journal editorial "responsibilitys return " commented the next day "it is good to hear any president or anyone in a position of leadership in this country talking about personal responsibility mr clinton is talking about it because in our recent history there hasnt been enough of it " then came the presidency mr giuliani has a remarkable gift for political empathy but i think he is acutely aware that no one talked this kind of talk better than bill clinton and that the show stopper ever after for charismatic presidential candidates will have to do with questions about character once in office so to the values voters he added "we lose trust in political leaders not because they are imperfect after all theyre human we lose trust with them when theyre not honest with us " a woman in the audience said "thats right " thats right but twice in the speech mr giuliani tried to explain that his faith and his personal failings were difficult to discuss "because of the way i was brought up or for other reasons " other reasons the way he was brought up in the pre vatican ii grade schools and high schools of new york city many of us understand but hell need to find a way to talk about "the other reasons " it was a remarkable effective and important speech and more useful still if mr giuliani and the religious right can reach some shared understanding of political and personal adulthood
