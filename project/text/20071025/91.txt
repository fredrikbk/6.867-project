notable &amp quotable john christy of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change co recipient of this years nobel peace prize responds to questions by cnn anchor miles obrien obrien i assume youre not happy about sharing this award with al gore you going to renounce it in some way christy well as a scientist at the university of alabama in huntsville i always thought that i may sound like the grinch who stole christmas here that prizes were given for performance and not for promotional activities and when i look at the world i see that the carbon dioxide rate is increasing and energy demand of course is increasing and thats because without energy life is brutal and short so i dont see very much effect in trying to scare people into not using energy when it is the very basis of how we can live in our society obrien so what about the movie "an inconvenient truth" do you take issue with then dr christy christy well theres any number of things i suppose fundamentally its the fact that someone is speaking about a science that i have been very heavily involved with and have labored so hard in and been humiliated by in the sense that the climate is so difficult to understand mother nature is so complex and so the uncertainties are great and then to hear someone speak with such certainty and such confidence about what the climate is going to do is well i suppose i could be kind and say its annoying to me obrien but you just got through saying that the carbon dioxide levels are up temperatures are going up there is a certain degree of certainty that goes along with that right christy well the carbon dioxide is going up and remember that carbon dioxide is plant food in the fundamental sense all of life depends on the fact carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere so were fortunate its not a toxic gas but on the other hand what is the climate doing and when we build and im one of the few people in the world that actually builds these climate data sets we dont see the catastrophic changes that are being promoted all over the place for example i suppose cnn did not announce two weeks ago when the antarctic sea ice extent reached its all time maximum even though in the arctic in the north pole it reached its all time minimum
