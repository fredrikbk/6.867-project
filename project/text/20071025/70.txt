lilly suspends two studies of key blood thinner drug eli lilly &amp co is suspending two small studies of the most promising drug in its pipeline signaling a potential setback for a blood thinning therapy the company hopes will become its next blockbuster the indianapolis company is to present its major late stage trial data on the drug called prasugrel to doctors at the american heart association meeting on nov but late yesterday lilly confirmed it is pulling patients off two narrowly focused studies of the medicine that were still continuing after data from several completed studies raised concerns about the dosage in certain patient groups lilly said the two studies are being suspended until their procedures can be adjusted wall street is watching prasugrel with a near myopic focus lilly which teamed up with japans daiichi sankyo co on prasugrel still plans to submit the drug for food and drug administration approval by the end of the year with its market debut as soon as lilly shares were down cents at &# in new york stock exchange composite trading at p m yesterday in after hours trading after the news the stock fell &# or to &# daiichi sankyo shares fell to yen &# thursday morning in tokyo lilly hopes prasugrel which would be used to prevent clotting in heart patients arteries will rival plavix which had nearly &# billion in sales last year the broader study to be presented next month concluded in july and lilly has been tallying data since then that study called triton looked at patients who began treatment at a milligram dose followed by milligram maintenance doses lilly relied in part on triton data in deciding to halt the continuing studies raising doubts about whether some dosages in that study were appropriate the two small studies that are being suspended had enrolled just patients at the same dosages being studied in triton a michael lincoff who directs cardiovascular research at the cleveland clinic said dosage adjustments are needed for patients who take certain anticlotting drugs already on the market based on factors such as weight age or kidney impairment that create a higher risk of bleeding he said lillys statement on the suspended trials was difficult to interpret but such a step would typically be taken for safety reasons with bleeding the most likely safety issue that would arise dr lincoff has conducted research on behalf of lilly bristol myers squibb co and sanofi aventis sa including research on plavix he hasnt been involved in studies of prasugrel dose adjustments arent required for any subgroups of patients who take plavix which is sold by bristol myers and sanofi aventis a lilly spokesman said the suspended studies werent designed to look at efficacy or bleeding risk he declined to explain what in the body of data that lilly has collected on the drug caused concern saying the analyses are too preliminary "the protocol amendments should not be interpreted to represent the outcome of the overall prasugrel clinical development program " lilly said in a statement credit suisse has estimated that top sales of prasugrel will be &# billion which would help lilly clear a significant hurdle as its &# billion antipsychotic zyprexa faces generic drug competition in prasugrels theoretical advantage is that it could block blood fragments called platelets from clotting more aggressively than existing therapies which include plavix and aspirin the drug could work for patients who resist plavix for some reason or could work more quickly in acute situations the suspended studies were looking at what levels of prasugrel and plavix block platelets from clumping together the market for such drugs is growing briskly patients who require their arteries to be held open by devices called stents now take blood thinning drugs indefinitely but the risk is also high drugs such as prasugrel and plavix can cause excessive bleeding in patients this can trigger minor inconveniences such as bruising but is a more serious liability in heart patients who quickly need surgery the concern that has hung over prasugrel is whether its more aggressive action could put patients at greater risk for bleeding the news ratchets up pressure on lilly in advance of the heart meeting next month since yesterdays news clouds the horizon for prasugrel "whenever a company suspends enrollment of a clinical trial it raises concerns " said rob califf a cardiologist at duke university who hasnt participated in prasugrel studies but has plans to be involved in the future
