style tricks of the trade style expert tim gunn makes small talk even in the less than genteel world of reality tv tim gunn the mentor figure on the "project runway" tv show never fails to project poise with several high profile jobs he is also chief creative officer at liz claiborne inc and co host of the show "tim gunns guide to style" mr gunn must attend numerous social functions and confidently navigate social interactions with executives fans and people who have never heard of him while small talk now seems effortless for him mr gunn says that it is an acquired rather than natural talent in his youth mr gunn suffered from shyness and a stutter he recalls that when he started teaching at parsons new school for design he was so terrified that he braced his back against the wall in order to stand he got over his fear in fact he has counseled his students on how to work on shyness "you just have to become a good actor or actress " he says "so practice with each other and learn how to do this " its important to convey not just confidence but also interest in other people "if youre saying one thing but your body language is saying something else then the person doesnt hear the words " he says he resists the temptation to look over the shoulder of the person hes speaking to at a cocktail party and always maintains eye contact being in the public eye often means people he doesnt recognize greet him with a friendly "hi tim " he never assumes theyve met "i always extend my hand and say hi im tim gunn and ill hope that theyll do the same " if people ask if he remembers them mr gunn might say "of course i do remind me again where was it " although mr gunn says that he lets conversations evolve organically he avoids controversial subjects if pressed for a small talk topic hell ask "what brings you here tonight " or the sure fire "who are you wearing " sometimes the issue is not empty space but too many words the key to politely leaving a conversation mr gunn says is to be forthright he extends his hand and says "its been lovely talking to you but im needed across the room " conversations are quasi relationships mr gunn says "every second that youre with someone and every word or sentence that you exchange extends the relationship so its a matter of what type of message are you trying to send to them "
