a cultural conversation with charles simic the immigrant outsider is now poetrys insider new york the great thing about the united states is that you kind of start everything from scratch " says charles simic the poet would know a thing or two about the american dream born in in belgrade yugoslavia mr simic moved to america at age he learned english as a teenager started using it to write poetry a few years later and this year was nominated by the library of congress to be u s poet laureate "being an immigrant you also feel a bit of an outsider anyway " mr simic explains "which is really good if youre going to be a writer " mr simic has been in this country for over five decades and he points to american icons such as wallace stevens emily dickinson and robert frost as influences still dark memories of war torn europe cast a long shadow over some of his finest work his poem "prodigy " for example describes nazi inflicted horrors of "i am told but do not believe that that summer i witnessed men hung from telephone poles " such poetic visions of the old country are particularly appreciated by certain audiences mr simic describes reading to a crowd of second generation americans who really liked his poems and how after readings some people would say "my grandfather used to talk like that " perhaps mr simics "starting from scratch" approach to poetry is in part what makes his work so original his poems sometimes appear to be quietly poking fun at poetry itself "i believe in the soul so far it hasnt made much difference " begins one poem another describes the sea "sounding weary after so many lifetimes of pretending to be rushing off somewhere and never getting anywhere " sparks of irreverence enliven his criticism as well one essay opens with this line "no poem can be more delightful or more idiotic than a sonnet " i meet mr simic on a rainy afternoon in his friends west village apartment the poet seems to delight in finding humor and absurdity in the world around him and his comments are often punctuated by an easy gentle laugh he seems to be getting acclimated to all the hoopla that comes with the poet laureate nomination mr simic is not a stranger to the spotlight he won the pulitzer prize in for his book of prose poetry "the world doesnt end " and a macarthur "genius" grant in but this is different he tells me in fact when he first got the call from the library of congress informing him of his nomination mr simics initial response was "im surprised astonished very honored but let me think about it " he just wasnt sure he wanted all the attention "my ideal poet is emily dickinson sit in a closet and write your poems " he explains his wife and kids were much less ambivalent about whether he should accept the nomination however and mr simic called the library back that very same day the realization that this was an honor not a job also helped persuade him becoming poet laureate will not drastically transform mr simics lifestyle he may have to do some additional readings but he will continue as before writing poems teaching at the university of new hampshire and editing for the paris review the honor may lead to invitations from official washington but mr simic says he is not interested "i dont think its my business to go hang out with politicians so i wont do that " the duties of poet laureates here in the u s seem much lighter than those of their counterparts in england british laureates are expected to write poems for certain occasions and the potential silliness of such a task does not appear to be lost on mr simic "if the queen has a cold you write a poem " he muses "in england its a very tough assignment " he adds "a number of really first rate poets have held the position of poet laureate in england and the poems they wrote on their job official poems were usually horribly embarrassing things " this is just one of the differences between poetic life in the u s and europe and in general mr simic seems more upbeat about america "i think poetrys in terrific shape " he says he points to huge crowds at poetry readings for well known writers even in remote parts of the country creative writing programs and university poetry series "over the years decades now there really has been an audience for poetry " he says poetry is apparently not enjoying the same vibrancy in europe in france for example mr simic notes "its very marginal " why are so many more americans interested in poetry "it is more democratic its kind of an expression of individuality individual conscience individual point of view " mr simic explains "its the only place we can say something about our private lives and hopefully make art " in parts of europe on the other hand poetry remains a pastime of the elite mr simic describes what may be a uniquely english experience "in england i know very good british poets who come from lower classes and who have told me that they would give a reading in some major university like cambridge or oxford and what would happen is someone would come up to them at the reception some don and would say sir what gives you a right to quote the classics with a background like yours " such a conversation might not take place elsewhere on the continent but mr simic points out some broader differences between american and european approaches to poetry "in europe poetry has always been a literary undertaking its really part of literature " mr simic says "if you write poetry in a serious way you are participating in a very long tradition over a thousand years they dont have for example the tradition of confessional poetry they never had a walt whitman " he adds "surrealist poets broke a lot of literary taboos they were irreverent but they would never write a poem saying this morning i drove my kids to school " in america he says poetry can play the role of a journal or a record of ones life and yes there is a downside to this "raw direct quality that allows us to write endless endless poems in our culture " he explains "one could say this is all wrong this is the trouble with american poetry so much of it is about someones life there is a kind of a narcissism me me me me me this is what happened to me and therefore im going to record it put it down and we all as readers shout its trivial dont bother it happens to everyone its boring " mr simics work avoids this problem perhaps its because readers might recognize some aspect of their own lives in his poetry from the simple delight of sharing a meal with a lover to broader sentiments of wartime dread mr simic explains that a poet "reminds the reader of his or her own human predicament " but perhaps above all mr simic sees poetry as a celebration of the individual point of view poetry he says "is one of the few places where individuals can convey their human predicaments say something about their existence its a private place a place where you can be free where you can attempt to convey what it meant to be alive in this historical moment " ms parker is an assistant editorial features editor at the wall street journal
