mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q is there any way to watch high definition tv on a mac in real time not downloaded from a service a as on windows computers there are add on tv tuners for macs that can both receive and record tv programs in real time some of them can handle high definition programming the best known company that sells such tuners for the mac is called elgato at elgato com q im interested in your perception of the treos future i currently use and generally like a treo id like to upgrade but ive read recently that palms future is uncertain i wonder if you think the treo is on a slippery slope down while the apple iphone will likely improve a i do believe that palm has allowed its software to stagnate and hasnt moved fast enough to make its hardware thinner and cheaper however there are also some positive signs at palm its new centro phone is pretty good smaller and less costly than a treo and the company is receiving an influx of funds and talent from a group of outside investors with experience at apple among other places palms fate and future may depend on the success of a project it has undertaken to create an entirely new operating system but the outcome of that effort wont be known for quite some time the iphone which is already very good will likely get better as it is just at the beginning of its life it has raised the bar for other smart phone makers such as palm especially when it comes to software but i expect other companies to match at least some of the iphones features and style which means apple will have to hustle to keep its lead in the past five years apple has done very well at staying ahead of competitors in the design of its computers and portable music players but the cellphone business is full of companies with more imagination than the typical pc maker and more resources than many makers of portable music players so the challenge for apple will be greater q my mom is legally blind and has difficulty working with email and downloading files i try to help her by phone but it never works and we live far apart so i cant just go over to help her i would like to install an application on her pc where i can take over remotely from home do you have any suggestions for this type of application a there are a number of possibilities one very simple option is a program called crossloop at crossloop com some versions of windows such as windows xp professional and windows vista ultimate also have remote desktop control built in you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online for free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
