politics &amp economics two tax proposals target wealthy fund managers washington as house democrats move to keep the alternative minimum tax from hitting more people this year private equity and hedge fund managers may be back in their sights for a tax increase there are two proposals one hitting private equity managers profits known as carried interest the other limiting offshore hedge fund managers ability to defer income taxes together they would generate nearly &# billion over years the same amount lawmakers need to replace revenue lost under their plan to limit the number of people hit by the alternative minimum tax or amt this year congressional budget rules require tax cuts be offset with spending cuts or tax increases though those rules can be overridden the private equity and hedge fund managers tax increases have been offered then knocked down repeatedly this year as lawmakers have sought new revenue resistance appears strongest in the senate where leaders may decide not to compensate for a reduction in the amt rolls slowing momentum for targeting carried interest as well as other revenue raising proposals it could also undercut the democrats claim that they not republicans are the party of fiscal responsibility rep charles rangel d n y chairman of the house tax committee plans to advance a &# billion one year bill that includes an amt reduction and extends popular tax breaks for businesses and individuals set to expire this year he may break out the &# billion amt fix separately the proposals will be in a broader tax bill mr rangel will unveil today he described the legislation yesterday to the members of his committee many of the sweeping changes mr rangel will propose in his broader tax bill a permanent repeal of the amt a cut in the corporate tax rate and proposals to raise revenue for those efforts arent likely to see a vote this year house democrats hope to act soon on the more urgent tax matters while they havent said publicly how they would pay for the offsets the revenue numbers suggest they may target private equity and hedge funds proposals that managers have been fighting for much of the year such a move would send a strong political message with democrats siding with middle income people who would have to pay the amt against wealthy private equity and hedge fund managers the proposal on carried interest would affect a cut of profits private equity managers receive thats taxed at the capital gains rate the bill in line with a proposal put forward last summer by house democrats would raise the tax rate to regular income rates of as much as venture capitalists and some real estate deals also would be affected people familiar with the legislation said the proposal would generate &# billion in revenue over years the other provision would raise &# billion over years by capping the amount of compensation managers of offshore hedge funds can defer each year under current law the managers can put off for years the income taxes due on large chunks of their compensation and they can reinvest the deferred amount in their funds and let it grow tax free in the meantime
