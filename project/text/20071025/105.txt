politics &amp economics fed plans transparency steps more forecasts seen but inflation target is likely to be deferred washington federal reserve officials are nearing consensus on several steps to make their deliberations more transparent to the public but are likely to defer one of chairman ben bernankes longstanding goals an explicit inflation target the centerpiece of their new communications steps would be the release of economic forecasts of policy makers four times a year instead of the current two times with additional detail and background according to people familiar with the matter moreover the horizon for those forecasts would be extended to three years from two the new initiatives have been in the works all year earlier this year the fed had hoped to finalize them by this month but the fallout of the market turmoil that erupted in august has complicated the agenda of next weeks meeting of the policy making federal open market committee and it may defer decisions on its communications policy to a later meeting indeed after months with little change the forecast for the economy has become highly uncertain the fed cut its target for the federal funds rate to from last month to limit the impact of a credit crunch on the economy the recent deterioration in housing markets and the stock market has prompted investors to expect an additional quarter point cut in the interest rate next week some foresee a cut of half a point while the idea of setting an inflation target hasnt been shelved officials say it needs more discussion meanwhile they see the longer forecast horizon as an interim step with many of the benefits of an inflation target the public could assume the fed expects to achieve its desired inflation rate in three years and thus a third year forecast amounts to a target the forecast approach sidesteps the biggest problems with an official number the misgivings some officials still have with a target potential political fallout and the difficulty of agreeing on the right number for mr bernanke deferral of an inflation target represents a setback but he can chalk up a tactical victory for forging a consensus on other steps the fed has been moving toward greater transparency for decades under alan greenspan chairman from to the central bank began announcing changes in the federal funds rate then releasing statements after all fomc meetings and reducing the lag between its meetings and the release of minutes but mr greenspan had little use for the collective forecasts the fomc has released twice a year since at the behest of congress and he opposed an inflation target as a constraint on the feds flexibility at his nomination hearing in mr bernanke restated his preference for a target while promising "extensive discussion and consultation" and "no precipitate steps " after he became chairman he began making greater use of the fomc forecasts to explain fed policy he also appointed fed vice chairman donald kohn like mr greenspan a skeptic of targets to head a subcommittee on communications mr kohn has shown signs of warming to the notion in september he said in a speech he was "relatively more persuaded" that targets help anchor the publics expectations of inflation the fomc as a whole is still not ready to take the step one concern is that congress having taken a more populist turn since democrats took power in could perceive a target as subordinating the feds responsibility for employment despite mr bernankes insistence to the contrary another is that officials dont think the current system is broken at present the fomc meets eight times a year and at two of its meetings members submit forecasts for the current and next year on growth inflation and unemployment that are included in a report to congress the "central tendency" of those forecasts a range that excludes the extreme projections garners the most attention rather than create new reports for the two additional rounds of forecasts the fomc is more likely to release the details in minutes to the meeting currently the forecasts are included in reports the fed chairman must by law submit to congress in february and july the forecasts for those reports are usually presented at two day fed meetings in january and june its unclear when additional forecasts would be made but the fed has scheduled two day meetings for april and october of next year at present the post meeting fomc statement and the minutes arent expected to be altered significantly
