the truth about the top key legislators and presidential hopefuls in the democratic party have proposed raising the top two tax rates theyre also suggesting extra surtaxes for war for alleviating the alternative minimum tax for social security and for subsidizing compulsory health insurance barack obama and john edwards advocate taxing capital gains at hillary clinton favors taxing dividends at the surtaxed income tax rates the argument for these proposals has nothing to do with the impact of higher tax rates on incentives and the economy it is all about "fairness" defined as reducing the top s share of income this political exercise invariably begins by citing dubious statistics about pretax incomes among the top million tax returns as an excuse for raising tax rates on the top among others echoing speeches from sen clinton business week recently exclaimed "according to new internal revenue service data announced last week income inequality in the u s is at its worst since the s before the great depression the top percentile of wealthy americans earned of all income in up from in " these statistics are extremely misleading first of all the figures do not describe the top percentiles share of "all income " but that groups share of "adjusted" gross income agi reported on individual tax returns for one thing thousands of professionals and business owners who used to report most of their income under the corporate tax responded to lower individual income tax rates after and by reporting more income under the individual tax as partnerships llcs and sub s corporations peter merrill of pricewaterhousecoopers found that "since the tax reform act of the share of business income earned through pass through entities has increased by from in to in " business profits accounted for just of the income reported by the top in according to economists thomas piketty and emmanuel saez but that business share leaped to by and to in it is this bookkeeping shift moving business income from the corporate to the individual tax not ceo pay which raised the top s share on individual tax returns income reported on w forms salaries bonuses and exercised stock options accounted for only of total income among the top in down from in and in real compensation among the top actually fell from to turning to the denominator of this ratio "all income" a huge portion of middle and lower income is no longer reported on tax returns a larger and larger share of middle class investment income is now accumulating outside of agi because it is inside ira k and savings plans the cbo reckons the top accounted for more than of all capital gains interest dividends and rent reported on individual tax returns by yet estimates of the share of national wealth of the top range from if the top own of all capital how could they be collecting of the income from capital they cant and they arent the top is simply reporting a rising share of capital income because those with more modest incomes are keeping a rising share of their capital income unreported in ira k and accounts millions also shrink their "adjusted" incomes by subtracting contributions to iras unavailable to the rich another huge swath of middle and lower income is excluded because agi includes only the taxable portion of social security benefits and totally misses most other transfer payments such as medicaid food stamps and the earned income credit the canberra group an international group of experts on income statistics brought together from by the oecd world bank u n and others insisted household income must include everything that "increases the recipients potential to consume or save " government transfers amounted to &# trillion in more than the total income of the top in the basic piketty and saez estimates &# trillion as a result of such huge omissions and tax avoidance the agi of &# trillion in was &# trillion smaller than pretax personal income personal income was &# trillion in after subtracting &# billion of payroll taxes anyone suggesting agi is a more accurate measure than personal income is obliged to argue that gdp in was exaggerated by estimated income shares from the irs or messrs piketty and saez are not about income per household but income per tax return that matters because the top fifth of households average two salaries per tax return the census bureau reports that the top fifth accounted for of all full time works last year while the bottom fifth accounted for just in fact of the households in the bottom fifth had nobody working not even part time for a few weeks when labor economists discuss income inequality they habitually switch to speculating about skill based differences in hourly wages totally ignoring differences in hours worked third the latest irs figures are not comparable with those of much less with because the definition of agi changes with changes in tax law such estimates differ greatly with the irs saying the top received only of income in because agi then excluded of capital gains while messrs piketty and saez put that years figure at and the cbo says it was the irs figures only go back to so the business week comparison with the s is invalid the new figure is from the irs but the old one is from messrs piketty and saez their recent estimates are also not comparable to their prewar estimates before their figures were obtained by dividing top income shares by of personal income their estimates for were obtained by dividing top incomes by the &# trillion left on tax returns after excluding even taxable transfer payments if total income for was defined as it was for then the share of the top would have dropped to in compared with in besides as messrs piketty and saez explained "our long run series are generally confined to top income and wealth shares and contain little information about bottom segments of the distribution " a fundamental problem with all tax based income data involves "taxable income elasticity " numerous studies some by mr saez show that the amount of top income reported on individual tax returns is highly sensitive to changes in marginal tax rates on individual income corporate income and capital gains after the tax on dividends was reduced in for example top bracket investors held more dividend paying stocks in taxable accounts rather than in nontaxable accounts and fewer tax exempt bonds when the top tax on capital gains was cut in and investors reacted by trading stocks more frequently and realizing more capital gains in taxable accounts in the piketty saez data capital gains accounted for only of the top s income from to when the capital gains tax was by contrast capital gains accounted for of the top s reported income from through when the tax was down to even if estimates of the top s income share were not so sensitive to changes in tax rates they would still tell us nothing about what happened to incomes among the other the top s share always falls in recessions even aside from capital gains but that certainly doesnt mean recessions raise everyone elses income "it is a disputed question " wrote messrs piketty and saez "whether the surge in reported top incomes has been caused by the reduction in taxation at the top through behavioral responses " in fact their data clearly suggest that higher tax rates on top incomes dividends and capital gains would sharply reduce top incomes dividends and capital gains reported on individual tax returns such behavioral responses would have little impact on actual income or wealth at the top while nonetheless leaving middle income taxpayers stuck with a much larger share of the tax burden mr reynolds a senior fellow with the cato institute is the author of "income and wealth" greenwood press see related letters "letters to the editor its not so bad to be part of the top " wsj nov
