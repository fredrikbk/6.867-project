renewable stealth tax democrats in congress are huddling in their low carbon footprint backroom in search of a compromise energy bill and all eyes have been on the issue of raising fuel economy standards but theres a lot more to worry about here than whether so called "cafe standards" rise to miles per gallon or from today the house version omitted cafe standards altogether to mollify michigan house baron john dingell but that doesnt make it the better piece of legislation the bill runs to pages and bears the vaguely orwellian title of "new direction for energy independence national security and consumer protection act " in fact the bill undermines energy independence by raising taxes on domestic production and throwing up new barriers to exploration its hard to see how it has any effect on national security and were at a loss about its consumer protection claim too unless you think americans need "protecting" from the incandescent lightbulb the bill bans those effective on page but its worst and little noticed provision may be a requirement that of u s electricity be generated from "renewable" sources by utilities that cant meet these goals are fined taxed really based on how far short of this eden they fall currently only about is provided by such renewables as wind solar or "biofuels " one obvious problem is that some states have better prospects for renewable energy than others hydroelectric power is easier to generate in the mountainous west than back east so what supporters might say if its more expensive for some to generate electricity through renewables those utilities can either buy excess credits from others as permitted in the bill or pay the fines but the fines amount to a tax on low cost energy producers without generating any environmental benefits and whether credits are purchased or fines are paid those added costs will go into the utilities rate bases driving up consumer electricity bills at the same time utilities would be forced to pour money into pursuing the mandate rather than investing in badly needed upgrades to the nations electrical grid in any case as were all discovering with corn based ethanol renewables have their own problems both substantive and political liberals are all for wind power as long as it doesnt obstruct their oceanfront views off nantucket hydro power is dandy except it kills fish and disrupts their habitat solar requires acres and acres of real estate theres plenty of land for solar arrays in the middle of the country or at least there was before the land was turned over to grow corn for heavily subsidized ethanol and by the way using farmland for energy means using less to grow food which means higher prices at the kitchen table or more food imports or both the house members who voted for this must figure all of this will be some other congresss problem earlier this year mr dingell suggested that if congress were really serious about global warming it would impose a carbon tax at least thats being honest about the costs the "renewables" mandate in the house energy bill by contrast is a multibillion dollar stealth tax on electrical utilities and ultimately on electricity users the danger is that with all eyes on car mileage standards this tax could become law without many people even noticing
