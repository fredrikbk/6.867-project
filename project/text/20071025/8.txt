airlines explore new routes executives talk the talk about upside of mergers but big barriers remain with a recovery under way but with market values still puny the u s airline industry is under wall streets increasing pressure to shed noncore assets such as frequent flier plans and to get serious about consolidation the airlines now appear to be listening there is no solid evidence that any deals are in the works and airline mergers still face considerable barriers but airline executives in recent weeks have acknowledged consolidations benefits richard anderson who took over sept as chief executive officer of delta air lines inc said last week that consolidation "could make sense for delta if its done thoughtfully from a position of strength " under prior management the airline fought off a hostile takeover by us airways group inc early this year executives at american airlines parent amr corp and southwest airlines co also have nodded to the benefits in recent weeks "consolidation may well have the potential to create a healthier industry " said tom horton amrs chief financial officer "consolidation would help the industry " said southwest airlines ceo gary kelly though the carrier is focused on initiatives to increase revenue a spokeswoman says united airlines parent ual corp also has taken steps to break out financial results for frequent flier programs and other ancillary businesses moves that could give potential buyers greater insight into those businesses financial health delta and american are considering similar moves years of painful restructuring capacity cuts and a surge in air travel have left the u s airline industry in its best financial shape since the sept terrorist attacks tuesday in the industrys latest flush third quarter profit report ual reported net income had risen to &# million or &# a share but many industry observers believe earnings may be at a peak oil prices are flirting with &# a barrel raising the prospect of higher jet fuel prices "im worried about where oil prices can go " standard &amp poors airline analyst jim corridore says meanwhile a new open skies agreement between the u s and the european union set to go into effect in the spring will create new opportunities but also greater competition in the wide margin trans atlantic market mindful of that british airways plc last week said it wants to bolster its relationship with american while delta and air france klm sa announced a broad joint venture that will share profits airline stocks have taken a beating the american stock exchange airline

that of amrs hedge funds and institutional investors are demanding airlines take more dramatic steps wall street would love to see consolidation that would let airlines take seats out of the air and in theory give them more power to raise fares airline investors recently have been bouncing between carriers trying to foment deals and enlist other big airline shareholders in the push people familiar with the situation said ual ceo glenn tilton has advocated combinations for three years to contain the number of seats cut costs broaden route networks and better compete with foreign carriers that are moving down this path until now he and doug parker us airways ceo were the only vocal proponents of this view "the investment community is demanding change " mr tilton said in an interview last week "its just a question of time " he added "muddling through" the next downturn "isnt sufficient " some investor disquiet comes from shareholders who were issued airline stock in return for their creditor claims when carriers emerged from bankruptcy court protection that equity hasnt appreciated the way many had expected and they think a merger or multiple combinations would lift share prices for the industry as a whole others simply worry the industry doesnt have a plan b if oil stays at &# a barrel or goes higher short of consolidation they are pushing the companies to sell or spin off noncore assets which some analysts have predicted could unlock billions of dollars of value united has begun efforts to sell all or a majority of its maintenance and overhaul operation in san francisco to private investors or a large maintenance provider although that move could be blocked by its mechanics union united also has begun studying options for its frequent flier plan united plans to form a separate profit and loss statement for mileage plus by year end says kathryn mikells uniteds vice president of investor relations united also is studying options for its cargo business in a conference call to discuss deltas third quarter results mr anderson also talked about improving returns from deltas maintenance and business jet operations by running them as standalone businesses and he said delta will soon decide whether to sell its comair regional airline unit the ceo cautioned that the fate of deltas mileage program "needs to be a post consolidation sort of decision " amr has been publicly chided for failing to create shareholder value by an activist investment fund in iceland last week amr said it was weighing whether to sell assets including its regional airline an investment advisory subsidiary its maintenance operations and mileage program asset divestitures could prove much easier than mergers given the difficulties of winning antitrust approval blunting labor opposition and performing a complex operational integration so far the right partners dont appear to have found each other and there doesnt seem to be an immediate deal catalyst although mr andersons surprise remarks last week raised expectations bill hochmuth a research analyst at thrivent investment management said he cant recall an airline merger when at least one partner wasnt troubled "there is no precedent for merging two healthy carriers " he said "but none of the airlines now are particularly weak " uniteds informal efforts in the past year to strike deals with continental airlines inc and delta went nowhere as did preliminary conversations between delta and northwest airlines corp us airways the product of a merger with america west airlines still is digesting that transaction but remains warm to future combinations
