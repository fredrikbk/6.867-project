politics &amp economics shift is afoot on mexican border security crackdown cuts illegal crossing but aids smugglers el paso texas a security crackdown on the mexican border is believed to have reduced the number of people trying to cross illegally into the u s while increasing business for professional smugglers with ties to the drug trade data to be released next week by the department of homeland security are expected to show the number of illegal border crossers caught fell to less than one million for the fiscal year that ends sept the first time that has occurred since through the end of august barely apprehensions were recorded along the u s mexico border a drop of more than from the previous fiscal year the decline thought to show that fewer migrants are attempting to cross will add weight to claims by u s officials that heavier law enforcement is making it more difficult for migrants to sneak across the mile border with politicians deadlocked over how to deal with illegal immigration trying to seal the border to catch and deter illegal immigrants has become the main policy tool but the crackdown also appears to be affecting the markets for smuggling people and drugs in mexico as tighter security makes crossing the border trickier and more hazardous the traditional mom and pop operations in mexico that used to ferry people across have been replaced by larger more professional criminal gangs often with ties to the illegal drug trade u s officials are reporting increased violence along the border including gunfights between rival smuggling gangs gangs hijacking each others customers en route to u s destinations and the rape or assault of migrants special agent alonzo pena chief investigator for u s immigration and customs enforcement in arizona says as the border gets harder to cross fees to smugglers have increased from next to nothing to as much as &# a head making the smuggling business an attractive new market for drug gangs "its one of the unintended consequences of sealing the border " mr pena says border patrol agents have noticed that smaller scale smugglers on the mexican side are being replaced by more sophisticated ones who appear to have ties to mexicos cocaine cartels smugglers are carrying higher caliber weapons and sometimes dress in camouflage uniforms and use military tactics to evade capture "drug cartels have more resources " explains border patrol agent martin hernandez now in his fifth year monitoring the busy corridor between el paso and ciudad juarez in the mexican state of chihuahua in el paso the border has become much more difficult to cross more than agents patrol a mile border stretch that covers busy urban centers in this binational metroplex of three million people as well as remote patches in the new mexico desert where ranches harbor safe houses used by smugglers by adding agents in each of the past two years with another expected next year the border patrol has nearly doubled its strength here high tech cameras motion sensors and miles of reinforced steel fence choke off smuggling routes the addition of national guard troops along the border for part of this year has also increased vigilance the crackdown together with a slower u s economy has helped stanch the flow of illegal crossers in several ways the higher risk of getting caught and higher cost of crossing has prompted many illegal workers in the u s to stay put rather than return home every year to do things like celebrate christmas with their families for those who still want to cross the higher risk means putting their lives in the hands of more organized criminal groups with the means to get them through authorities are beginning to see commingling of drugs and human loads and are frequently seizing migrants who apparently are paying for their trip by carrying drugs for traffickers "drug smugglers use them as mules " the border patrols mr hernandez says with loads of as heavy as pounds each being walked across the desert u s agents have noted that people smugglers are starting to follow drug smuggling routes protected by mexicos sinaloa cartel a cocaine trafficking organization either paying a transit fee to the cartel or sharing operations with the drug traffickers that may explain the apparent paradox that while the smuggling of people across the border is down trafficking in narcotics is ticking upward department of homeland security data this month show a rise in border drug seizures especially of marijuana a total of million pounds of the drug was seized along the u s mexico border between october and the end of august up from million during the fiscal year ended sept and million in the fiscal year ended sept cocaine seizures rose slightly while seizures for methamphetamines and heroin fell slightly the increase in drug seizures is seen by border agents as an indicator of an increase in imports
