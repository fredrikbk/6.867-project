fires turn up heat on a key advocate of california shrubs mr halsey loves chaparral but not too close to home battle over clearing brush as wildfires raged in southern california this week richard halseys embrace of the local shrubland turned prickly the founding director of the california chaparral institute mr halsey has spent four years defending the existence of chaparral the term given to the wide varieties of shrubby plants trees and bushes that dot the regions hilly landscape his web site californiachaparral com celebrates its diverse plant life seasonal ponds that gleam like "liquid sapphires" and birdlife that includes bushtits and towhees "i awaken each morning to a view of old growth chaparral coating a nearby mountain like a carpet of green velvet " he writes "the first sound i usually hear is that of the wrentit a secretive little bird with a descending whistle that mimics the beat of a bouncing ping pong ball " on tuesday mr halsey found himself standing on the roof of his century old home garden hoses at the ready as wildfire spread across the chaparral and torched houses a quarter mile away the witch fire as the conflagration was named was bearing down on his town of escondido calif just northeast of san diego feeding off the bushes mr halsey has fought to save in the or so wildfires that have ravaged hundreds of square miles in southern california in the past few days chaparral has been the primary fuel whipped by strong winds the fire has spread across this vegetation consuming some homes along the way chaparral has long bedeviled local fire planners a key to fire prevention mr halsey and fire officials agree is clearing such brush from around homes and other buildings to keep flames from jumping from brush to home but some fire management officials have proposed more aggressive measures including clear cutting strips of chaparral to create fire breaks or conducting controlled burns to combat overgrowth to minimize the potential of destructive wildfires mr halsey takes the opposite view allow the chaparral to grow and let nature take its course "our landscape is being misrepresented and condemned " he wrote in an essay on his web site "we need to come to its defense " mr halsey began his chaparral crusade in when he set up a web site after the areas devastating cedar fire which started four years ago today mr halsey says he was appalled that the public criticized san diego fire departments for not doing enough to battle the fires but he also didnt like the bum rap the plants were getting "the problem is not the chaparral " he said this week "the problem is people and the way they decide to place houses " he adds "when you put a flammable structure in a flammable corridor its like putting a bowling pin in a bowling alley ultimately its going to get taken out " while mr halsey is a gadfly with a self promotional bent the issues he raises are ones that have vexed southern california for decades and may get worse in the midst of the current drought in the west how to manage the so called urban wildland interface where the wild meets civilization has long been a hot button issue amid the current wildfires there has already been plenty of sniping on sunday afternoon at the height of the brush fire in ritzy malibu calif l a county supervisor zev yaroslavsky told a local television station that part of the blame for the intense brush fire lay in the hands of the state coastal commission which he said protects plants instead of clearing brush to mitigate fire risk "it was an understandably emotional mischaracterization of the commissions policy " says sarah christie spokeswoman for the california coastal commission "we allow brush clearance around structures" as long as it minimizes the impact on the brush she says mr yaroslavsky declined to comment further diane spaeth a ramona calif resident whose house burned down in the fire says she cant see the point in opposing controlled burns if it could help save houses "were grateful when chaparral is burned with less fuel theres less intensity to the fire " she said yesterday as she tended to horses evacuated because of the latest fires she and her husband rebuilt their ramona home and diligently remove chaparral from their plot sometimes using machines she says on the internet the year old mr halsey offers all aspect of thought on dry dense scrubby vegetation calling himself the "voice of the chaparral " the former biology teacher implores firefighters not to burn or cut swaths of chaparral in the wilderness in the name of fire prevention controlled burns he argues not only destroy the ecosystem but also arent effective at reducing future wildfires because the weeds that replace burned chaparral can be even more flammable mr halsey offers two types of membership to the institute one costing &# another &# which include a subscription to the "chaparralian" newsletter which he emails quarterly essays in the current issue address global warming and mr halseys proposal to change the designation of local national forests to "national chaparral recreation areas " he sells a dvd called "secrets of the chaparral" &# for nonmembers and sells his recent book about chaparral and wildfire that includes color photographs of southern california plants and animals mr halsey says he has paying members "theres such a drumbeat against the native vegetation that weve lost perspective" when it comes to fighting fires says mr halsey who says he has been trained by the united states forest service as a wildland firefighter prevention he says "is not a one answer question " mr halsey has gained vigorous support from some in the local fire establishment "he is one of the most knowledgeable guys out there in this field " says jeff bowman former chief of the san diego fire rescue department who resigned last year after the city council was unable to fund &# million to upgrade the department when mr halsey published his book after the wildfire mr bowman agreed to review the manuscript beforehand this weeks fires have led mr halsey to do some soul searching when he moved to the area in he says "i knew there were brush fires but i had no idea about any of the real dangers " his house was built in and he has no desire to lose it to a chaparral fueled firestorm and while he has made significant efforts to fire proof it including a fire resistant roof he admits it still contains some highly flammable old wood as the fire roared into escondido on tuesday mr halsey ignored the mandatory evacuation order along with teams of firefighters he and a handful of other residents used hoses to soak buildings and extinguish flying embers that sought footholds on patio furniture inside roof vents and under eaves "embers are why a lot of these structures got taken out " says mr halsey "the only way to get rid of the embers is to get rid of the vegetation " he remains opposed to controlled burns or clear cutting vegetation in the wild but from now on he says in his speaking engagements he will put much more emphasis on keeping the chaparral away from homes and other buildings "my passion and my bias is to favor the environment and the natural habitats " mr halsey said yesterday afternoon as he walked by several burned out homes but after this fire he says "i have a greater appreciation now for the impact of vegetation near structures than i did before " mr halsey has no plans to overhaul his web site to give it an anti chaparral viewpoint but he might add first hand stories about fireproofing homes near chaparral "ill definitely add a line on the web site that clearly says chaparral presents a real fire risk " jonathan karp contributed to this article
