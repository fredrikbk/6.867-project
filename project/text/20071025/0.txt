a college championship thats a different kettle of fish lake lewisville texas like a lot of college athletes justin rackley dreams of turning his sports passion into a lucrative professional career so when he picks up his pole and goes fishing hes not taking a day off hes in training bass fishing joined the ranks of collegiate championship sports two years ago and although there are no scholarships for wetting a line its winning converts from a surprising array of students last year mr rackley walked away from the baseball team at his local junior college to join the fishing team at texas a&amp m university "between sponsorships and prize money he assured us he could make more money fishing than from baseball " says his mom wendy rackley "well see " recently mr rackley and his texas aggie teammate trevor knight attempted to fish their way to a &# prize and the national collegiate bass fishing title they were among two person teams drawn from college fishing clubs from across the country in the second annual national collegiate bass fishing championship on lake lewisville a huge reservoir just north of dallas no need for helmets and shin guards just ultra light graphite spinning rods and a pocketful of wiggly plastic "wacky worms " the goal to end each day with five living fish that weigh in total more than other teams fishing might not involve the spine crushing perils of football but it comes with its own risks "there are three occupational hazards skin cancer high cholesterol and hemorrhoids " says katrina dehaven a pro angler and fishing coach of arizona state universitys team coaches face their own challenges during the three day tournament ms dehaven stayed up all night to guard the three boats her team lugged from phoenix and parked in the lot at their budget motel mr rackley now a year old college junior admits that fishing never figured in his childhood dreams of athletic glory but with the growth of two professional angling tours in recent years tournament purses have mushroomed to as much as &# million to a single winner the countrys top five anglers each pocketed at least &# in winnings last year not including lucrative sponsorships from boat motor rod reel and lure makers that can be worth even more the sport of fishing knows it has to attract young people or die the average age of an angler rose to years old in and the number of fishing licenses issued fell over the last decade the collegiate bass anglers association was founded two years ago by two former college baseball coaches hoping to reaffirm fishing as a sport for the young "if we dont do something to get these kids to stay in fishing of them will come back from college with golf clubs " says charles goodloe president of careco multimedia a video production company specializing in outdoor sports that helped produce a version of the national competition that will edit out the boring parts of waiting for a bite and be shown on the fox college sports network in january the networks parent news corp is in the process of buying dow jones &amp co the parent of the wall street journal the national collegiate athletic association bans college athletes from accepting sponsorship swag or prize money the collegiate bass fishing circuit is considering applying for ncaa recognition which would allow for travel equipment and tuition to be subsidized but for now the sponsorship money flows freely the national championship in lake lewisville had over a dozen sponsors including sporting goods retailer cabelas inc and boatu s an association of boat owners "this is more wholesome than the nfl or baseball there are no scandals " says irwin jacobs the well known financier and deal maker who owns boat maker genmar holdings inc a sponsor from boat companies to lure manufacturers and makers of beef jerky sponsors heap free goodies on the college fishermen and fisherwomen throughout the year helping to defray the high cost of angling as well as to keep them hooked on the sport a decent bass boat costs &# and it costs another &# for the trailer to haul the boat to and from tournaments most teams brought an average of two dozen rods between them all rigged differently for different conditions it was easy to spot the newest fishing teams at the tournament their anglers wore plain t shirts instead of colorful jerseys plastered with names of bait companies and sunglass makers "we havent got money from any anyone " gripes casey crumpton a finance major at university of montevallo in alabama and a member of the schools three week old fishing team "it cost me &# just to run the boat around the lake today " the college anglers took a whole off week from school to compete in the championship at lake lewisville each night they spent two hours preparing a dozen or so rods checking knots sharpening and baiting hooks for the next day the first three days they practiced called "pre fishing " competitors got the lay of the lake and picked out their special spots the competition began at sunrise thursday and ended at p m for a weigh in after the fish were weighed they were put in a tank and released later back into the lake by the end of day one the montevallo team in its unadorned gray t shirts was in first place with five large mouth bass weighing a total of pounds mr crumpton refused to say where he and his teammate caught them or how fearing a competitor would move in on their territory "a couple of guys tried to get in on us today " says mr crumpton "im locking up the gps tonight i dont want anyone looking at it " it was a different story the next day mr crumpton and his montevallo teammate had little luck at the old spot and had trouble finding another "honey hole " or spot with lots of fish they returned with no bass knocking them out of the running on saturday five teams louisiana tech university of wisconsin madison western kentucky texas a&amp m and the university of alabama competed in the finals while most of the anglers fished in the brush near the shoreline "flippin the brush" in fishing parlance the texas a&amp m team used a different strategy mr rackley and his teammate mr knight hung out in the marina nabbing fish that were noshing on the algae growing on the wood pilings they caught four fish weighing pounds and won the competition the &# prize will go to a&amp ms fishing club whose members will decide how it will be spent says mr rackley the duo also won rods and the opportunity to fish with the pros in an event on the flw tour named for legendary bass boat maker forrest l wood to date schools have contacted the collegiate bass anglers association asking for help in starting a college fishing team no doubt many of the angler wannabes dream like mr rackley of becoming a pro ms dehaven the arizona state coach makes sure they know what theyre up against "yes there is money to be made and sponsors help you " says ms dehaven sporting a gold spoon lure around her neck "but remember in the end nature always wins "
