new shipping law makes big waves in foreign ports rotterdam the netherlands a u s law that will require foreign ports to scan every container they ship stateside looks set to create big winners and losers and force consolidation at ports around the world designed to ensure freight containers arent used by terrorists to smuggle weapons or bomb materials into the u s the law on maritime cargo scanning requirements is shaping up to have a dramatic impact on the global shipping industry port officials and operators in europe and asia say companies that make the giant &# million x ray or gamma ray machines needed to scan shipping containers are anticipating a boom in orders as roughly ports around the world gear up for the u s rules which were signed into law in august but take effect in industry analysts say each will have to buy one to of the scanners or stop exporting to the worlds richest market large modern ports mostly in asia also expect to win new business as smaller and older ports struggle to meet the u s requirements the european union estimates the average start up cost for a port to buy and support the scanners will be around &# million too much to make business sense for some minor ports to go on shipping to the u s big older river ports like antwerp in belgium are also at a disadvantage antwerp would need to build new roads and bridges to get all containers to scanners from its scattered docks and may not be ready in time "were looking at billions of euros in extra spending " says lieven muylaert a belgian customs official the eu has led opposition from around the world to the new u s requirements worrying the relative lack of flexibility at many european ports will add to cost advantages asian exporters already hold over european companies asias newer ports tend to be bigger but more compact than their european counterparts they will have less trouble meeting the requirements port operators and analysts say the eu has threatened to impose reciprocal constraints on all containers landing in the eu from the u s since the attacks of sept the u s has toughened rules that aim to stop terrorists from smuggling weapons into the country in containers the or foot steel boxes that carry everything from bananas to toys to lawn mowers around the globe the u s imported million containers of goods last year and that number is expected to rise according to the u s security experts say the container scanning law may reduce but wont eliminate the risk of terrorists smuggling weapons aboard ships that is partly due to the poor resolution of x rays able to scan something as big as a container according to jim cowling managing director for maritime security solutions ltd a london based consultancy it is also because ships remain vulnerable to tampering after leaving port "it could be possible to hijack or bribe a ship and put a container on it in the middle of the ocean " says mr cowling the new u s scheme will replace the current risk based system under which only selected containers get scanned under the new system giant x ray devices would scan every container for suspicious shapes at a rate of about three containers per minute it now takes several minutes to scan a container the three main international suppliers of container scanners are nuctech co a chinese state owned company that dominates in asia u s defense contractor science applications international corp which sells mainly in the u s and smiths heinmann gmbh part of smiths group plc a pan european firm all three compete in europe and latin america a fourth company rapiscan systems a division of osi systems inc also makes scanners but is behind the others in orders say analysts michel lequy who sells nuctech scanners in europe says orders already grew to dozens per year from low single digits before u s lawmakers started talking about the scanning law in he expects a further increase after governments and ports start budgeting for the actual law next year "we can cash in on a boom " he said though europes governments are likely to pick up much of the extra cost for major ports like antwerp to meet the rules construction can take years in the face of tough eu environmental laws putting them at a significant disadvantage antwerps troubles could mean more business for the nearby dutch port of rotterdam which is more compact than antwerp and expects to be able to install the scanning equipment quickly and at comparatively low cost "security is a good business opportunity " says peter struijs chief operating officer at rotterdam without significant change to the rules smaller ports such as seville in spain dunkirk in france and naples italy could have to stop shipping to the u s altogether "the law will force us to stop shipping to the u s unless we can attract a lot more customers which would justify investment in the equipment " says philippe revel manager for the shipping terminal at dunkirk the bush administration has said it wants to cut the number of ports that ship containers to the u s to around world wide from today because that would make it easier to monitor security consolidation would also force more trucks onto europes already congested roads however as they move u s bound goods to bigger but more distant ports for shipping port operators say the biggest long term cost of the u s rules may be the extra "dwell time" the number of days that containers packed with goods spend sitting on docks clogging terminals and delaying shipments before they head out to sea operators estimate average dwell time will increase to seven days from around five after port officials say the impact of the new law could be softened if the u s agrees to let companies such as wal mart stores inc which fill their own containers to scan containers themselves wal mart campaigned against the law "we shouldnt have to put those containers through an x ray machine " says andreas mai harbor master at bremerhaven a german port that ships over a thousand containers a day to the u s carrying everything from mercedes car parts to red bull soft drinks mr mai has been lobbying u s officials to implement the new law so that ports would have to scan only containers packed by individuals or small businesses one u s customs official said washington would listen to such concerns "we know this is a work in progress " the official said bruce stanley contributed to this article
