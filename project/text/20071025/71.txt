media war round ii when michael powell former head of the federal communications commission learned last week that his successor and sometime rival kevin martin plans to try to update the countrys antiquated media ownership rules his response was "i admire his courage " ours was better put on your helmet and shoulder pads back in when mr powell was at the helm the fcc voted to ease the prohibition on companies owning tv stations with a combined audience reach of more than in addition it voted to change the rule that prevents "cross ownership " or a newspaper proprietor from also owning a tv or radio station in the same local market in a three network television world such limits arguably could be justified with the advent of cable television satellite tv and the internet however they serve little public purpose nevertheless opponents of media deregulation went to the mattresses reed hundt who was fcc chairman under president clinton accused mr powell of "promoting the most radical view of media consolidation that any democracy has ever supported " democratic representative lynn woolsey said the fcc was attempting to impose a centralized "saddam style information system in the united states " ted turner said that relaxing the rules "will stifle debate and inhibit new ideas " an organization of small broadcasters filed a suit challenging the rules and the u s court of appeals for the third circuit in philadelphia ultimately ruled against the fcc the justice department decided not to appeal congress meanwhile passed a law overturning the agencys decision to lift the television ownership cap to settling on a compromise that put the cap at after having promised to veto any congressional tinkering the bush administration backtracked and hung mr powell out to dry mr martins plans are less ambitious he wants the fcc to hold a vote on the cross ownership rule which he opposes by the end of this year since mr martin and two fellow republican commissioners comprise a majority on the five member panel he should prevail but opponents of more vigorous media competition have vowed to put up another fight "if in fact the chairman has indicated he intends to do media ownership by december of this year " said democratic senator byron dorgan last week "there is going to be a firestorm of protest and im going to be carrying the wood " at a senate commerce hearing yesterday claire mccaskill a missouri democrat remarked that large media conglomerates give her "heart palpitations " apparently its not just the health of our democracy that hangs in the balance mr dorgan along with republican senator trent lott led the political opposition to deregulation four years ago this time theyve threatened to propose a "resolution of disapproval" that would authorize congress to veto any fcc relaxation of media ownership limits the senators claim to be concerned about too much consolidation too little media "diversity" and a reduction in local programming in reality theyre shilling for local broadcasters who dont want the competition theyre also reflecting the political lefts ideological paranoia about corporate media ownership yet the critics have no such objections to the lefts operational control of national public radio or pbs one of the most obsessive critics of free market media ownership is bill moyers who seems to be a permanent fixture on public broadcasting complaints from consumers union moveon org and other interest groups that the fcc isnt allowing enough time or opportunity for public comment also dont hold water the agency has conducted a series of public meetings nationwide in the past months by the time it votes on changes in december eight such hearings will have occurred relaxation of the rules had been urged by most of the broadcast networks and many large media companies including tribune co gannett new york times co and news corp whose deal to purchase the publisher of this newspaper is pending the new rule isnt expected to affect news corp s acquisition of the journal but in any case these columns have long favored letting the free market determine the size of a company the media concentration that has occurred and is likely to continue is a direct response to new technologies segmenting traditional outlets as tv networks and newspapers have seen their viewers and readers decline theyve used consolidation to offset audience fragmentation this has led not to monopolies but to a media landscape that is more diverse than ever americans have never had more news and entertainment options if federal media ownership regulations are to encourage such dynamism rather than inhibit it they need to be updated see related letters "letters to the editor pining for the days of strong local news" wsj oct
