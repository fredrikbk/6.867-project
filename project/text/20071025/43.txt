every person should own his own medical history the reply by brian d kent m d letters oct in response to bill gatess proposal that online medical records could enable a patient to "take ownership" of his medical data is misdirected his retort that such a patient would be like a man who acts as his own lawyer and thus has a fool for a client confuses personal health with medical interventions by members of the health care industry today when eight of out the leading causes of death are incurable chronic diseases doctors are more like firemen who vainly try to put out fires caused by arson or negligence or both most chronic diseases including heart disease diabetes and many cancers can be either prevented or delayed by behavioral and lifestyle changes yet we rely on doctors to repair the wreckage wrought by our own irresponsibility online medical records give patients easier access to the information that they already have the right to so they can better interpret question and act upon it with or without the ongoing help of medical doctors to guide them along the road from sickness to health health is a state of being that truly should only be "owned" by each individual and not something that is sold or leased to us by the medical establishment improved online access to patients own medical information is just one small but necessary step toward shifting the control of ones personal medical data and of reinstatement of the concomitant responsibility for ones health back to ourselves jeffrey r wyant darien conn see related letter "letters to the editor were sick not guilty" wsj oct
