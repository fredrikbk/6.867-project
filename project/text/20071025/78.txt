merrill takes &# billion credit hit oneal faces grilling as loss tops forecast stock price falls after presiding over one of the biggest losses in wall street history merrill lynch &amp co chief executive stan oneal finds himself with a weakened power base as he fends off charges that he let the firms exposure to risky mortgages get out of hand merrill said yesterday it took a &# billion hit in the third quarter from revaluing bonds backed by mortgages and taking other write downs that was far higher than the &# billion hit merrill estimated just two and a half weeks ago a surprise that led the firms stock price to fall as its credit rating was downgraded overall merrill recorded a &# billion loss for the quarter making it the only one of wall streets five biggest investment banks to end the period in the red ratings firm standard &amp poors described the write downs as "staggering" and blamed "management miscues " merrill lynchs board met on sunday and monday to preview the results and grilled mr oneal and top executives the meeting was "definitely tense and very testy " says a person familiar with it mr oneals job doesnt appear to be in immediate jeopardy this person said but the write downs which amounted to about one eighth of merrills total value at the end of the quarter emboldened critics among merrills alumni some of whom had already been toying with the idea of an activist campaign to unseat mr oneal a campaign by morgan stanley alumni led to the june ouster of that companys then ceo philip purcell "this was a great firm with a great franchise and it is not being led well " said win smith the son of one of the firms founding partners who lost out to mr oneal in a horse race for the top job "it is in need of the right leadership for the future " on a conference call with analysts mr oneal said "im not going to talk around the fact that some mistakes were made " but he described merrill as the victim of an "unprecedented liquidity squeeze" that started this summer through a spokeswoman mr oneal declined to be interviewed although merrills stock is up under mr oneal it hasnt risen as much as its major rivals merrills share price has climbed since he took over on dec while goldman sachs group inc is up and morgan stanley has risen over the same period mr oneal has never enjoyed strong support from key factions within the firm he isnt a former broker like many of his predecessors and unlike some other wall street chief executives such as richard fuld of lehman brothers holdings group inc or lloyd blankfein of goldman sachs his roots arent in the capital markets and trading area mr oneal pushed to expand merrills role in new kinds of bonds and other financial instruments which helped propel profits in recent years before leading to trouble merrills annual operating profit averaged &# billion between and more than double the &# billion average in the preceding five years the &# billion hit leaves it clear that mr oneal and his team didnt always appreciate the risks they took to achieve the greater profits the write downs surpass a &# billion loss suffered in by the hedge fund amaranth llc which had stood as the largest single known wall street loss mr oneal ousted more than a dozen top executives in a cost cutting drive after he gained the top job last year he replaced a veteran group of risk managers led by jeffrey kronthal with a younger less seasoned team one merrill director ran into larry fink chief executive of bond manager blackrock inc in a restaurant tuesday and the two men briefly discussed the issues at merrill according to people familiar with the matter no overture was made to mr fink during the encounter these people said but a bigger role for mr fink would be logical blackrock which is owned by merrill is a fast growing bond manager with expertise in the area of merrills recent weakness and mr fink was approached about becoming ceo of morgan stanley in and nearly forged an alliance with morgan last year until merrill snatched the deal away by offering more favorable terms he is also close to greg fleming who was recently made co president of merrill on the conference call mr oneal accepted a share of responsibility saying "i am accountable for the mistakes as i am accountable for the performance of the firm overall " that didnt prevent a tough interrogation by analysts who wondered why merrills estimate of its losses a few weeks ago was so far off when mr oneal and another merrill executive noted that merrill had volunteered more information about its exposure than its wall street peers analyst mike mayo of deutsche bank ag retorted "but your peers didnt take an &# billion write down " merrills &# billion overall loss for the quarter came to &# a share compared with a profit of &# billion or &# a share a year earlier before a one time gain from the transfer of merrills money management unit to blackrock it was merrills first quarterly loss since mr oneal attributed the bigger than projected write downs to worsening market conditions and a "more conservative" valuation of the firms current &# billion portfolio of mortgage related securities which merrill said has shrunk from &# billion in late june "it was a bad quarter and worse than anything we would have expected " said analyst william tanona of goldman sachs mr oneal said merrill planned to explore selling some noncore assets such as a &# billion sale of two life insurance units announced in august to aegon nv merrill said it will also suspend its stock buybacks until around years end s&amp p and moodys investors service cut merrills credit rating which will increase merrills cost of raising funds to do business s&amp p cut merrills senior debt rating one notch to a+ its fifth highest level and kept it on negative watch for possible further downgrade merrill said it had cut in half its exposure to one risky asset class collateralized debt obligations which are securities backed by pools of assets including mortgages it said it now has &# billion in cdos down from &# billion three months earlier analysts pushed merrill to say whether it had cut its exposure by selling the cdos or by buying hedges in an attempt to balance future losses mr oneal declined to give a breakdown merrill has been wall streets leading underwriter of cdos since in addition to its mortgage and cdo write downs merrill recorded an additional &# million of losses or &# million before deducting fees from commitments to finance leveraged buyouts and other corporate activities the firm said it exercised "aggressive and effective risk management" in limiting the corporate loan losses two and a half weeks ago mr oneal ousted merrills head of fixed income osman semerci and a top lieutenant in the u s and appointed ed moriarty as the firms new chief risk officer merrill said its other businesses are prospering stock market revenue climbed to &# billion and investment banking revenue rose to &# billion on merger advisory growth for much of the mortgage boom merrill was able to sell the bulk of the cdos it underwrote to investors all over the world but from late onwards it became harder for the investment bank to find buyers for the growing volume of mortgage cdos it was arranging many investors felt they had invested enough money in this asset class and financial guaranty companies which wrote credit insurance on many cdos were getting skittish about their growing exposures to mortgage securities in a slowing housing market for merrill the fees it earned from arranging deals were too lucrative to give up its profits averaged of the deal volumes it did or around &# million for each &# billion cdo more than of the securities issued by each cdo bore triple a credit ratings traditionally these top rated securities were insured by a financial guaranty company which effectively bore the risk of losses but by mid few bond insurers were willing to write protection on cdos that were ultimately backed by subprime mortgages to people with poor credit histories according to people familiar with the matter merrill put large amounts of aaa rated cdos onto its own balance sheet thinking they were low risk assets because of their top credit ratings many of those assets dived in value this summer serena ng contributed to this article see related article "it plunged into
