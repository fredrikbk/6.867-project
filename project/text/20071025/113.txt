reinventing the wheel the latest car technology driving on nitrogen pumped tires what it is nitrogen is a gas that some automotive service outlets and parts suppliers are promoting as a superior alternative to common compressed air typically used to inflate tires part of its appeal is that auto racing teams the aviation industry the military and other groups bent on precision have for years used purified nitrogen to fill tires because it is more stable and produces more consistent inflation pressure even during severe temperature changes than compressed air compressed air can contain contaminants and oxygen which makes up about of ambient air and that can speed up tires degradation nitrogen advocates say one supplier calls compressed air "your tires worst enemy " how to get it a number of large auto supply chains smaller service shops tire dealers and even costco stores offer nitrogen inflation the gas is typically pumped from a simple storage tank or from more complex equipment that separates nitrogen from the surrounding air some suppliers of nitrogen inflation systems like ultrafill a unit of air products &amp chemicals inc list dealers that offer nitrogen inflation on their web sites ultrafill com but the gas is becoming more widely available the best place to look for it is at your local tire store or auto repair shop upside nitrogen is better suited to use in tires than compressed air in part because its larger molecules dont seep or "migrate" through the tires rubber skin as quickly so nitrogen filled tires maintain pressure better and can make it easier to maintain the benefits of proper inflation including improved fuel economy better handling and longer tire life tire makers say the rule of thumb is that tires lose one to two pounds per square inch of pressure every month the rate of loss varies and tends to be lower for cars driven less frequently downside nitrogen inflators arent as easy to find as old fashioned compressed air hoses that are available at nearly every gas station using the purer gas doesnt free you from having to check tire pressure regularly also paying for air may make some drivers feel silly cost speaking of inflation filling up with nitrogen can be surprisingly expensive prices of &# to &# per tire are typical but &# per tire isnt uncommon some gas stations still offer compressed air which is about nitrogen free of charge while others charge cents for a minute or so of inflation time comment filling up with nitrogen may answer a question that few motorists are asking the marketing push in favor of the gas is also dotted with hype about harm caused to tires by corrosive compressed air while its true that rubber decays from contact with oxygen the process is so gradual that it doesnt matter to everyday drivers even tire makers dont necessarily recommend it goodyear tire &amp rubber co says it neither endorses nor forbids the use of nitrogen and the rubber manufacturers association says compressed air is safe and more economical nitrogen the group says is a good choice "when its free "
