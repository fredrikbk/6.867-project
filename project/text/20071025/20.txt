commercial construction may slow the pace of u s commercial construction activity which had remained strong despite a sharp contraction in housing is showing signs of slowing and could drop next year for the first time since the early part of the decade the latest sign that companies are turning cautious about the economys prospects in a closely watched report expected to be released today mcgraw hill construction will forecast that spending on commercial and manufacturing buildings such as offices warehouses and hotels will decline next year in dollar volume and in the number of square feet of space built that would be a sharp turnaround from this year when commercial and manufacturing construction is expected to end the year up in dollar volume the mcgraw hill forecast is based on the companys tracking of construction projects including the issuance of building permit data by local governments that data known as construction starts are an indicator of future construction spending and often correlate strongly with actual construction spending the strength in the commercial sector until now had been offsetting the decline in the housing market that appears to be changing though continued growth in institutional construction such as universities and hospitals and road construction will provide somewhat of a balance the pattern of having one sector up while the others were down "has been a moderating force " says robert a murray vice president for economic affairs at mcgraw hill construction a unit of mcgraw hill cos a new york based publisher all construction spending including residential construction is expected to shrink next year compared with a decline of this year the smaller total projections for next year indicate that mcgraw hill believes the sharp declines in residential spending may be moderating this year for example spending on single family home construction is expected to drop but just next year "firms are taking note of the slower economy this year and expected slowness in and are adjusting their construction plans accordingly " mr murray says slower job growth could damp demand for new office space while retail builders pull back in the face of a slowdown in housing a key driver in demand for new shopping centers and strip malls hotel builders are seeing a glut forming after three years of heated lodging construction there are indications that this summers credit crunch and the tightening of lending standards will put a damper on plans for real estate expansion especially among commercial real estate developers and companies that are intensive users of real estate "we are also seeing the effect of tighter lending conditions that support commercial building " mr murray says if the expectations hold true would mark the first time since the recession of the early s that overall construction spending fell for two years in a row commercial construction currently contributes about half of the overall &# trillion construction economy according to the u s commerce department residential construction makes up the other half though this year commercial is likely to outpace residential as the housing market continues to falter the construction industry accounts for almost a tenth of economic activity and is a major generator of jobs government spending on highways and infrastructure is expected to increase "in the aftermath of interstate highway w bridge collapse in minneapolis the momentum for increased spending on transportation and public works has been boosted once again " mr murray says much of that increase however is riding on a planned increase in federal highway spending currently under debate in congress with president bush putting pressure on congress to cut spending it is unclear if such legislation will go into law institutional construction will continue to grow at a clip but mr murray warns that could change in as government tax receipts which support those types of buildings could fall in the face of slower economic growth
