free dennis kozlowski its hard to rally much sympathy for l dennis kozlowski apart from his criminal conviction the ex ceo of tyco international is best remembered for buying a &# shower curtain throwing a &# million birthday party for his much younger wife and for having tyco buy an &# million apartment on fifth avenue tacking on another &# million to spruce the place up still his conviction which will be appealed today is questionable at best despite millions for his defense dennis kozlowski was railroaded kozlowski wasnt convicted for overspending nor for defrauding investors the most common charges leveled against corrupt ceos he was convicted instead of grand larceny that is of stealing his bonuses which were certainly oversized but even if you believe the worst about kozlowski and his co defendant former tyco cfo mark swartz they were paid according to a contract and that is not stealing if this is the case how was kozlowski convicted the charges against kozlowski started when he was indicted for sales tax evasion not paying nyc tax on multimillion dollar paintings by claiming they were being shipped to new hampshire those charges got the ball rolling kozlowski was fired and the tyco board hired superstar lawyer david boies to conduct an internal probe at the time the company appeared to owe kozlowski more than &# million in deferred payments a matter still in dispute like most such internal investigations mr boiess probe wound up absolving those whod hired him and he heaped blame on the now absent kozlowski the results of the investigation including the crazy spending on what was the ceos pied a terre were leaked to the newspapers a much larger indictment followed in rapid succession this one for stealing or "looting " as it was oft characterized in the media the enron saga still fresh the bald ruddy cheeked kozlowski became the poster boy for corporate greed and abuse as with everything about tyco and kozlowski the numbers were eye popping the ceo had been paid as much as &# million in a single year a legal and public relations steamroller was in full motion the trials there were two with the first ending in a hung jury focused on the testimony of tyco directors several directors denied that they ever approved the huge bonuses doled out to kozlowski and swartz they didnt know how much the ceo was being paid the directors said mr boies who the board paid millions to fight against kozlowski testified too this clear conflict of interest is now a major point in kozlowski and swartzs appeal kozlowskis lawyers tried to prove the directors did know about the bonuses part of their problem was that the director who they said knew the most had died letting the district attorney bill their defense as a shameless ruse but it was all beside the point there is no question that kozlowski was paid according to the incentive compensation plans that were duly approved by the tyco board in and again in the plans rewarded the ceo and cfo with bonuses based on improvements in company earnings cash flow and earnings per share excessive thats an understatement but though the record keeping was careless nothing was secret the contract and the payments were all on the books partly because tyco was growing so fast largely from acquisitions even a small percentage of the growth amounted to sums that were princely even by ceo standards but that was the deal whether the board members remembered the deal or not in the wake of the enron scandal and faced with kozlowskis myriad bonuses corporate loan programs renoirs monets and &# umbrella stands its hard to fault the jury for smelling a rat and following its nose but the key question was a legal question can a payment recorded on a companys books disclosed in proxy statements and pursuant to contract be stolen michael obus the trial judge never gave an answer and threw it all to the jury unlike enron or worldcom tyco never went bust an investor who held tyco shares during mr kozlowskis year tenure would have quintupled his stake the stock fell on the scandal but recovered within months now his funds forfeited or frozen the wife for whom kozlowski threw the infamous party is divorcing him he and swartz denied bail pending appeal went to prison despite months of trial over pages of legal briefs and the gaudy sums at play the case is not complicated lets hope the appeals judges benefiting from time and distance can send this prosecution back to square one mr ackman is a lawyer and a journalist
