politics &amp economics bush seeks middle ground on childrens insurance bill washington the bush administration looking for compromise on an issue causing heartburn for many republicans shifted its position on a major area of disagreement with congress over a childrens health insurance bill health and human services secretary michael leavitt said the administration would be willing to support letting states cover health care for children in families earning as much as of the federal poverty level or about &# a year for a family of four in the state childrens health insurance program or schip the administration previously opposed permitting states to cover children above the level "in order to find common ground we are prepared to begin having a conversation about those between and " mr leavitt said the shift came just before house democrats announced they would vote today on a childrens health bill modified to address concerns raised by house republicans democrats hope to sway enough republicans to their side to override another expected veto by president bush the shift narrows at least one major difference in the standoff between mr bush and congress over legislation reauthorizing and expanding the program that provides federal grants to states to help cover health care for low income children mr bush vetoed legislation that would have added &# billion over five years to schip and expanded coverage to about four million more children house democrats attempted to override the veto last week but failed to win the required two thirds majority the protracted debate over schip has been difficult for some republicans who opposed the legislation as labor groups and other organizations accuse them in a high profile ad campaign of siding with mr bush over needy children the administrations move may help undercut claims from democrats and some republicans that mr bush has been unwilling to make any concessions to the party that now rules congress mr leavitts olive branch came with conditions he said legislation would have to ensure that states meet a "rigorous" standard of covering children below of the poverty level before they could expand to higher levels the administration has said that states should have to cover of children below the poverty level before they could expand to higher incomes but democrats and many state officials say that standard is impossible to meet other differences remain between democrats and the president the two sides are far apart on program funding house democrats have modified the legislation that passed congress in an effort to pick up more republican votes people familiar with the bill said it now wouldnt permit coverage expansion to children above of the poverty level would more quickly phase out coverage of adults some states now cover and make more explicit the fact that illegal immigrants wouldnt be covered in the senate enough republicans already support the legislation to beat a veto
