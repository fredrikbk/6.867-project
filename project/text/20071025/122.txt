the afternoon report more heat on tehran online edition the u s announced broad sanctions against elements of the iranian military and financial system sending a message moscow and beijing as well as tehran the sanctions covered a swath of individuals banks military agencies and affiliated companies including irans elite revolutionary guards corps which was designated as a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction and the elite quds force an arm of the guards which was named as a supporter of designated terrorist organizations the u s says the group has provided powerful bombs blamed for the death of u s troops in iraq a charge iran has denied the sanctions also swept up irans defense ministry logistics unit three officials in its ballistic missile program and two additional state run banks secretary of state condoleezza rice joined at a state department news conference by treasury secretary henry paulson said the moves were in response to "a comprehensive policy to confront the threatening behavior of the iranians " although she also said that washington remains open to "a diplomatic solution " mr paulson called on "responsible banks and companies around the world" to end relationships with the three banks and companies and affiliates of the revolutionary guard iran is already subject to comprehensive u s sanctions for supporting terrorism which largely prohibit u s companies from dealing with the country "this is really i think intended as a shot across the bow toward europe asia and russia " said suzanne maloney a senior fellow at the saban center for middle east policy at the brookings institution in light of business ties between russia and china and irans military establishment the latest sanctions "could make those relations fairly complicated for the russians and the chinese " ms maloney said nile gardiner director of the margaret thatcher center for freedom a foreign policy think tank at the heritage foundation agrees that todays sanctions send clear signals to china and russia they also represent a bid by the u s to go outside the united nations in order to put more pressure in iran "the united nations has proven to be hugely ineffective over the iranian nuclear question and also in terms of dealing with irans open aggression over iraq " mr gardiner said the u s has pushed two sanctions resolutions through the u n security council but a third has bogged down amid chinese and russian opposition vali nasr of the council on foreign relations stresses that while the substance of these sanctions might not be radically different from measures already in place washingtons latest step could have significant consequences "this essentially will make most of irans leadership too hot to handle and that would make the prospect for negotiations much more difficult " mr nasr said stocks move lower stocks turned lower in the wake of economic data on housing and durables goods orders the dow jones industrial average and the s&amp p
