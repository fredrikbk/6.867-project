offering a peek into what could be the next region for deal making among exchanges in recent years public offerings by exchanges in asia europe and the u s have set off a wave of modernization as broker associations have morphed into for profit groups with an eye on expansion just this year the new york stock exchanges takeover of european exchange operator euronext nv formed a company nyse euronext that owns exchanges in six countries and is valued at more than &# billion latin america has lagged behind the trend but several ipos are awakening strategic interest in the region in addition to bovespa brazils main futures and commodities exchange the bolsa de mercadorias &amp futuros and mexican exchange operator bolsa mexicana de valores also are planning ipos and in the first foray by a major u s exchange into latin america chicago mercantile exchange owner cme group inc announced plans late tuesday to acquire about of brazils bm&amp f which trades things including cotton

spell of stability that stands in contrast to past boom and bust cycles there have been ipos on the market this year so far and foreign investors seeking emerging market returns have pushed the markets key index up by since january the markets success is a big change from the s when a wave of privatizations shrank the number of listed brazilian firms demand for the bovespa ipo has been heavy and that could make the deal which is being underwritten by goldman sachs group inc and credit suisse group among others one of the biggest ever for a stock market as well as brazils largest ipo to date overall it could rank as the fifth largest ipo of world wide just after that of private equity firm blackstone group lp according to thomson financial executives at rival exchanges called the ipo price steep but brazils climbing market put many big investors in a position where they "dont want to miss the boat " says bernardo mariano a partner at financial advisory firm equity research desk bovespas offering raises the odds for a deal with other exchanges although big u s operators have so far stayed away bob greifeld chief executive of nasdaq stock market inc which recently made a bid to acquire nordic exchange operator omx ab said recently that his priority remained on opportunities in the middle east and europe latin american exchanges he said could represent "a second phase" of consolidation deal makers face a number of hurdles in the region as is common in brazil bovespas bylaws are structured to poison any takeover attempt more than banks and brokers own shares in the market with none currently topping a stake mergers and deals "wont be automatic like when the nyse went public and their biggest shareholders became hedge funds " says benn steil director of international economics at the council on foreign relations in new york latin america also remains divided culturally and politically which has slowed attempts at consolidation three years ago bovespa and stock markets in mexico colombia and chile began working on a strategy to permit each to trade the others stocks but that plan has gotten hung up on legalities according to an official in mexico observers praise bovespa for boosting interest in brazils stocks in it introduced the novo mercado a listing for newly public companies with u s style corporate governance standards partly as a result foreign investors have bought up of shares in new listings which have included real estate companies banks and ethanol plays indeed bovespas novo mercado has been stoking a fever for corporate "transparency" that is helping to remake business in brazil and is likely to extend the ipo trend to go public closely held family companies are rapidly retooling bringing on new management and investors and becoming more efficient currently some additional firms are waiting for regulatory approval for ipos already this year companies have raised &# billion in initial offerings on bovespa ranking it fourth in the world after exchanges in london new york and hong kong according to thomson and some observers think brazils exchange could emerge as a low cost competitor for south american firms looking for dual listings that might otherwise go to new york or london in july an argentine bank banco patagonia went public in brazil and other latin american companies have been sounding out the market one big draw is the brazil markets trading activity it has grown steeply since when bovespas average daily volume was only about &# million now it averages &# billion a day an increase over last year the exchanges profit is leaping too to &# million in the first half of the year still bovespa ranked st among stock exchanges by the value of trades in the first half of behind the nyse nasdaq and exchanges in london and tokyo nearly of trades on the exchange involve just two companies oil giant petroleo brasileiro sa or petrobras and iron ore miner companhia vale do rio doce sa such blue chips appeal to investors who want emerging market returns but are wary of investing on unfamiliar terrain now predictions are that bovespas stock will quickly join the short list of brazils
