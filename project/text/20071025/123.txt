the daily fix favored sox host upstart rockies at last fall classic is set to begin online edition the boston red sox for so long cast in the role of perennial underachievers have a chance to become the first team since their archrivals the new york yankees to win two world series in a five year span the colorado rockies who before had had just a single playoff win on their resume have a chance to stun baseball and continue their implausible streak of wins in games including seven straight in the playoffs at last the world series is upon us "one team is playing for history and the other may only have this one chance to win everything " tim marchman writes in the new york sun "one team has three world series mvps and the other has only two everyday players who made a postseason roster before this year depending on how you define it both teams have a claim to being the best in baseball right now its not a glamorous matchup but it is an awfully good one " one thing our two league champions have in common wacky ballparks fenway park where the red sox will host tonights opener thursdays game and potentially games and ranked first among all baseball stadiums this year in scoring colorados coors field meanwhile perennially ranks in the top five even after the rockies starting suppressing scoring by putting baseballs in humidors the rockies have figured out that taking pitches is essential for survival in home run friendly ballparks steven goldman writes in the new york sun "in a hitters park patience is not a virtue its a skill necessary for survival " he writes "the air in colorado does not discriminate it amps all hitters not just rockies assuming average pitching on both sides in a typical game the rockies are going to hit a home run and so are the visitors its not the big fly thats special its how many runners are on base when it goes out " boston knows this too leading the majors in walks on hardball times josh kalk notes that the ballparks favor hitters in different ways at coors the air is thin and the outfield is full of gaps while fenway is cozy that means both teams outfielders are likely to struggle in new environs the red sox are the logical pick to win thanks to the american leagues superiority and bostons superiority within its league but washington post columnist thomas boswell isnt so sure "if the red sox are simply a much better team as many think all this may be irrelevant " he writes "but in the world series being better isnt always important " he cites several recent stunners such as the champion florida marlins and notes that by his measure of the last world series deserved a grade of a for entertainment "anticipating boredom in october baseball just bucks all the odds " mr boswell writes "go ahead and yawn say the red sox will win in a laugher that the rockies will be killed by their layoff and that the nl cant upset the superior al two years in a row prediction rockies in seven games how do they win game at fenway surprise me " bostons starting rotation was the big story this morning knuckleballer tim wakefield is off the roster and may have unleashed his last fluttering pitch in the majors because of recurring shoulder trouble "from kevin kennedy to terry francona five red sox managers have known just whom they could count on in times of emergency in the pitching department " bob ryan writes in the boston globe "tim wakefield has been a security blanket for skippers around here for years and the fact that he cannot pitch in the world series is a matter of no small consequence " meanwhile game starter daisuke matsuzaka redeemed himself with boston fans by winning the pennant clincher against the cleveland indians "imagine shouldering the expectations of two proud demanding baseball nations " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "there is japan where dice k has been a living legend since his teenage years and then theres new england red sox nation the most skeptical unforgiving community of them all if matsuzaka had cost boston a shot at the world series hed officially become a multimillion dollar bust a complete waste of time and money hed have his own place in the pages of dubious sox lore right along with galehouse burton dent and boone " colorado enters the world series as more of an unknown commodity gerard baker slights todd helton and matt holliday in the times of london by writing that the rockies "do not boast a single familiar player in their lineup" denver post columnist mark kiszla says mr hollidays profile is about to gain national prominence thanks in part to his agent scott boras "holliday will be marketed as more than a hitter with serious pop in his bat " mr kiszla writes "this is a made for tv hero perfect for a starring role on a regional sports network boras told me weeks ago before the legend of holliday grew with his head first slide into the playoffs or his homer that put the exclamation point on the rockies drive to the world series " even in the rockies short history there are forgotten pioneers espn coms gene wojciechowski reminds readers of mickey monus a co founder of the team who served more than years in prison starting in for fraud and embezzlement charges mr monus is no longer involved with the rockies but hell be rooting for them "monus will watch every world series game on tv " mr wojciechowski writes "a year old man will try to be a kid again the ghost of the rockies past reappears " manager clint hurdle has some ghosts in his past too including his record as a cant miss prospect who missed and compiling the worst record in triple a history as manager of the tidewater tides a year before the rockies debuted in the majors virginian pilot columnist tom robinson reviews the ups and downs of mr hurdles baseball career mr hurdle whose five year old daughter suffers from prader willi syndrome earlier this year visited the hospital bedside of year old kyle blakeman two years ago mr hurdle learned of kyles kidney cancer by chance from a blakeman family friend who stood next to the manager in a checkout line mr hurdle and young mr blakeman struck up a friendship and two months ago mr hurdle began writing kyles football uniform number on his lineup sheet as a potential good luck charm for the rockies season to nowhere four days later kyle died "they made an odd pair these two " john romano writes in the st petersburg times "the gregarious year old and the shy year old brought together by their love of a game and bonded by the randomness of a disease the day his number was first written on the lineup card was one of the final times kyle was lucid enough to interact with his parents in the room he watched on tv as the rockies came from behind in the bottom of the ninth colorado has not stopped winning since " high school baseball coach brian fleury died friday at age after fighting hodgkins disease for two decades in the newark star ledger steve politi listens as delbarton graduate jay schmid recalls his former coach "as schmid worked his way up the interstate he remembered the trust his favorite coach showed in a once troubled kid how fleury who also was athletic director gave him a job coaching the freshman baseball team when even he wondered if he was responsible enough to oversee two dozen year olds " mr politi writes "he remembered the way he felt at the athletic banquet his senior year when fleury called him up to give him an award he said "jay youre one of my favorite guys i love you " schmid said i was an year old kid ill never forget that "
