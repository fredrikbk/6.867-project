politics &amp economics new recipe for corn in farm bill washington the ethanol boom and higher corn prices are shaking up this years farm bill debate as growers press for a revised safety net more attuned to their new energy driven world the result is a washington marriage of interests between the powerful corn lobby and senators desperate for savings from farm programs which would fend off demands for cuts to subsidies but the crop insurance industry is up in arms wheat farmers are alarmed and critics say the government could pay more than predicted for a new revenue option proposed in the senate bill the background is the remarkable rise in corn prices spurred by ethanol demand a success story that has cut off corn producers from most of the subsidies dictated by the current price support system "the only way they are going to get money is to change the payment mechanism " one administration official said and this has sparked interest in alternative approaches that put less emphasis on price per se and more on revenue economists have long argued that this approach makes sense as a way to deal with the swings in agriculture since revenue is a product of both prices and crop yields it will reflect not only market changes but disasters such as drought the senate bill proposes such a program known as average crop revenue which could be elected by farmers beginning in the complicated formula seeks to guarantee revenue roughly equivalent to of a farms average of the previous three years as currently drafted it appears most beneficial to corn and soybean producers in the central midwest to the extent revenue is protected crop insurance premiums are predicted to fall and since crop insurance is heavily subsidized any savings will also accrue to the government acr received a major boost when the congressional budget office concluded that so many farmers will sign up especially in corn rich states such as iowa indiana and illinois that washington could save as much as &# billion over five years the cbo estimate was a huge boon for agriculture committee chairman tom harkin d iowa helping him pull together the bill that began moving through his panel yesterday but about of the savings would be at the expense of crop insurance companies and critics argue there could be unintended consequences wheat growers who farm more marginal lands worry that it will lead to their rates being jacked up "its the three i" proposal " sen pat roberts complained accusing iowa indiana and illinois corn interests of a power play on the proposal the kansas republican is pressing for changes that effectively blocked final committee approval of the bill yesterday the national corn growers association which is the force behind acr advocated a revenue option as early as "its not so cynical and self serving as it might seem " said bruce babcock an iowa state university professor who has advocated this approach ron litterer an iowa based farmer and the corn growers president said "if we can improve the risk management tools its good " selling the idea mr litterer admits is a lot easier since corn prices jumped to highs of &# a bushel or twice the guaranteed &# per bushel price support in loans from the government with a softening in the ethanol market corn has fallen back to the range of &# per bushel but thats still cents more than the threshold for triggering countercyclical payments to qualify for acr a farmer would submit to tougher loan rules and direct payment subsidies a legacy of the s would be capped at &# an acre about &# to &# less than many corn growers receive today proponents argue that the reduction in premiums will offset these losses and a stronger floor will be established for the revenue now enjoyed because of demand for alternative fuels for example based on the experience of the past three years acr appears to establish a revenue floor for corn of at least cents per bushel higher than what the countercyclical program promises today
