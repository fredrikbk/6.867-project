global warming lets rely on science instead of hysteria daniel botkins voice of reason "global warming delusions " editorial page oct about putting climate change in perspective while working for science based solutions should be heeded by our public policy leaders in washington d c and state capitals regrettably hyperbole drives many of our policy decisions thus the ever swinging pendulum seeking the midpoint balance al gore is awarded the nobel peace prize for highlighting the importance of climate change but scientifically based research that might not track with the hyperbolic perception advanced by activists is ignored coincidentally the oct editorial "ethanols water shortage" highlights a similar policy rush to judgment to save us from imported oil and achieve "energy security" by strangling our nations water supply to produce among other things wood based cellulosic ethanol congressional tax credit proposals encourage this new industry without any regard to the sustainability of our forests nor the impact of subsidy hungry entrepreneurs diverting resources from existing commercially based industries in five years other industries will be reliving the same "oops dilemma" facing corn consuming industries unfortunately government subsidies only seem to address the demand side of the demand supply equation creating market distortions well be working to fix this mess later rather than addressing both sides of the equation today which doesnt fit into the need to solve our energy problems before the election cycle chris brescia st louis mo whats also alarming about the global warming alarmism being preached by environmentalist true believers based largely on cockamamie climate model pseudoscience is that credible scientists such as mr botkin feel pressured to assert that they are not "naysayers" or "know nothings" when they point out that true science does not justify a mindless costly and even environmentally damaging rush to do something anything to address climate change when truth tellers have to apologize for doing so or are shouted or cowed into silence it shows that despite our supposedly science based and rational age human nature is still as susceptible to "extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds" as it was when charles mackay wrote about them in donald r spalding whitefield n h mr botkin is very correct in assuming that we do not know the full extent of global warming and its true effect on our society however there is a risk that global warming could have negative consequences to our environment this risk whether real or imagined is enough to take action the action as mr botkin states may be a misallocation of resources however the associated research and development and the creation of a new industry will grow the global economy this action will also raise the awareness of other potential environmental issues which mr botkin feels is more pertinent second the growth in the economy from the creation of this new industry will allow for even greater resources to be set aside for such things as habitat preservation and other environmental initiatives only good can come from battling global warming whereas standing idle only exposes our society to additional risks michael e mcdonald new york prof botkin discounts the threats posed by global warming to wildlife by arguing that only a handful of species became extinct over the past million years during what he describes as similar periods of rapid climate change he fails to take into account two important differences between then and now the rate of climate change and the massive destruction of earths natural areas due to expansion of human civilization in the past climate changed as much as one degree celsius per years now we are facing changes times greater as much as one degree celsius per years thus plants and animals are being forced to respond to more rapid climate change than in the past beyond what genetics physiology or evolution may allow in addition as wildlife attempts to move to higher elevations or cooler latitudes in response to global warming its migration is blocked in many instances by the buildings roads dams and fragmentation of natural areas resulting from human settlement and infrastructure one need only look at a satellite image of the earth at night to see the pervasive imprint of humans on this planet we share with wildlife prof botkin is correct in one respect we do need to increase our scientific knowledge of global warmings impacts but that should not be an excuse for failing to take action immediately to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and help wildlife survive the impacts of global warming wm robert irvin senior vice president conservation programs defenders of wildlife washington see related letter "letters to the editor green taxes on the poor" wsj nov
