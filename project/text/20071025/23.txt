credit where its due imagine if congress tries to cut credit card costs by enacting new limits on fees and interest rates banks can charge but rather than lowering prices the new restrictions backfire fewer people who need credit can get it and nearly all of those who have a credit card pay more for the privilege in the form of new fees and higher interest rates not a realistic scenario its what happened recently in the united kingdom in the u k office of fair trading capped credit card penalty fees at gbp about &# roughly half what banks had previously charged but that cap just spurred several credit card companies to reintroduce something consumers there long ago stopped paying annual fees as well as introducing other new fees this bit of recent british history is instructive like their british counterparts american consumers have benefited in recent years as annual fees fell or disappeared completely interest rates have also fallen for the vast majority of cardholders as i found in a recent study i conducted with a colleague for the american bankers association much of this improvement comes from credit card issuers being able to charge lower rates to those who pose less of a credit risk the numbers tell the story before most credit cards charged fixed interest rates of about by the average interest rate had fallen to and a full of cardholders paid rates lower than two decades ago nearly all credit cards charged an annual fee by only a handful of them did except as part of a rewards program driven in part by falling fees there has been an explosion in the "convenience use" of credit cards consumers using their credit cards instead of cash and then paying their balances in full each month but there has been another quiet revolution made possible by risk based pricing consumers who have lower incomes or who carry a higher credit risk can now get credit cards when previously they couldnt these individuals can now handle unexpected expenses and emergencies without turning to for example payday lending institutions that charge far higher fees than credit card companies former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan put it clearly "unquestionably innovation and deregulation have vastly expanded credit availability to virtually all income classes access to credit has enabled families to purchase homes deal with emergencies and obtain goods and services " of course the stated purpose for new restrictions on credit card pricing is to protect high risk and low income individuals but price caps and other restrictions will do more to harm many of these individuals than they will to benefit them as seen in the u k price restrictions reduce access to credit and raise costs for the vast majority of cardholders when the prices of credit card firms can charge higher risk customers are capped they either cut off access to credit for those customers or make up the lost revenue by charging everyone a little more this kind of restriction could have a broad effect here because the u s economy is now more dependent than ever on consumer spending rather than place price controls on credit cards lawmakers should take the following steps to protect consumers first we need to improve transparency and make credit card disclosures more understandable such efforts have proven effective in the past but credit card products have become more complex in recent years a starting point is a set of recently released federal reserve proposals to improve disclosures about credit card interest rates and fees the effects of these proposals should be understood before new regulations are imposed second government nonprofits and financial institutions need to do a better job educating consumers programs to improve financial literacy can be very effective third we need better regulatory oversight to guard against unfair or deceptive practices currently regulation of the industry is fractured among various state and federal agencies consolidating the regulatory framework to quickly and consistently address bad practices would help protect consumers finally congress needs to take measures to enhance economic security by boosting private saving and otherwise protecting families against rising economic risks credit card debt is often the result of emergencies like job loss or illness congress should deal with the underlying problem not just the symptom imposing price controls on credit cards may help a few borrowers but it would raise the cost of having a credit card for everyone else and cut off access to credit for many of the riskiest borrowers thats no way to be a friend to consumers mr orszag a senior managing director of competition policy associates compass was an economic policy adviser to president bill clinton see related letter "letters to the editor usury plain and simple" wsj nov
