parsing candidates student loan proposals top democrats would end subsidized commercial loans government as sole provider the front running democratic presidential candidates are pushing a simple idea they say will improve the college loan system cutting out the middlemen and the middlemen primarily commercial banks and lenders are none too pleased this month new york sen hillary clinton issued her plan to make college more affordable through a range of proposals from creating a new tuition tax credit to simplifying the aid application process buried at the bottom of her plan is perhaps the most radical step a pitch to eliminate the federal family education loan program which gives subsidies to commercial lenders such as sallie mae to distribute federal loans to students months earlier former north carolina sen john edwards and illinois sen barack obama made similar proposals to eliminate the ffel program such a move would leave the governments alternative lending option the william d ford federal direct loan program as the sole provider of federally supported student loans the direct loan program allows students to borrow directly from the federal government through their schools financial aid office the loans that students get from either program do not differ in terms of interest rates or the amount that can be borrowed so the argument for eliminating ffel is that students could get the same amount of financial aid at essentially the same terms while saving taxpayers money by eliminating the need to subsidize the commercial lenders commercial lenders however assert that students benefit from the public subsidies to their industry for one thing the ffel industry says it offers far more incentives than the direct loan program does rewarding borrowers for on time payments with a slew of rebates and rate reductions many lending experts concede that few borrowers wind up qualifying for the incentives according to student loan giant slm corp better known as sallie mae less than of borrowers earn all the advertised repayment benefits but dissolving ffel would also leave schools and students with no choice in federal loans the lending industry says students would still be able to go to commercial lenders for private loans that arent part of a federal financial aid package john dean special counsel for the arlington va based consumer bankers association a group of student loan providers adds "not only are you going to eliminate competition but theres another factor what if the system fails " for its part the u s department of education says it is reticent to take on the added burden "as the regulator of both ffel and direct loan we want to ensure both programs stay healthy to better serve consumers at a time when families need options maintaining two viable loan programs is critical " said diane jones assistant secretary for postsecondary education luke swarthout higher education advocate for the u s public interest research group says the candidates proposals "recognize the need for a major overhaul of the loan system whether that looks like direct lending or some sort of hybrid market system remains to be seen " some lending experts say the competition between the two programs has yielded benefits for students before the emergence of the direct loan program "the quality of customer service was atrocious " says mark kantrowitz publisher of finaid org "all of a sudden we had the introduction of loan discounts lenders invested in improving the quality of customer service on the other hand the direct lending program is one of the better run government programs and thats because there are all these hungry lenders waiting in the wings" to steal away business in the long run eliminating the bank based ffel program "would eliminate choice forcing schools to operate under one government run program " says eric solomon spokesman for student loan provider nelnet inc it is also expected to hurt the bottom line of lenders such as nelnet and sallie mae already due in large part to recent cuts in federal subsidies a group of investors led by j c flowers &amp co has cut the offer price of its initial bid to buy sallie mae at &# a share the matter is in litigation the federal direct loan program was launched in the early s under president bill clinton the idea in part was to create a financial aid distribution program that would be less expensive to taxpayers by lending directly to students the federal government would have no need to subsidize the banks the new program resulted in competition for students which was also expected to ultimately benefit consumers with discounts and better service but the direct loan program stopped short of eliminating banks altogether instead schools were given a choice of using either the ffel or the direct loan program students are required to borrow through whichever program the school has chosen as it happens the ffel program has been steadily capturing more loan volume and today has about of the market in the past three academic years the number of ffel loans originated has increased to million while the number of direct loans has decreased to million one possible reason has emerged in recent months deals between lenders and schools that included perks to financial aid officials such as expensive dinners and travel to fancy resorts a nationwide probe by new york attorney general andrew cuomo has led more than schools and a dozen lenders to reach settlements totaling &# million an additional &# million has been paid back to students in the wake of these investigations newly empowered democrats in congress just passed an overhaul of federal student aid signed by president bush last month the college cost reduction and access act of cuts interest rates on certain student loans in half increases grants to poor students and creates a new loan forgiveness program the cost of it some &# billion over five years is paid for largely by significant reductions in the subsidies to banks and other lenders in seeking to address soaring colleges costs republican congressional leaders have been focused on reining in tuition the senior republican on the house education committee howard p "buck" mckeon of california has previously introduced legislation that could sanction schools that raise tuition too much a spokesman for republican fred thompsons campaign said the former tennessee senator hasnt yet detailed a higher education plan a spokesman for former massachusetts gov mitt romney says the candidate is concerned about the idea of eliminating the ffel program which he believes fosters competition an aide for former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani wouldnt comment specifically on the proposals but stressed the candidates belief in "choice " the clinton campaign estimates that eliminating ffel will save taxpayers about an additional &# billion a year "hillarys goal is to expand access to college " says sen clintons campaign policy director neera tanden "and she believes that direct lending should be part of the answer to make college more affordable " the competition the governments direct loan
