home &amp family cranky consumer finding online homework help for kids we seek an answer to a pizza problem ignored by dr math with school in full swing many kids are shouldering hours of nightly homework when students are stumped they can turn to their sometimes clueless parents or head to a flurry of online homework help sites we looked around for sites appropriate for our sixth grade tester and we wanted help solving this geometry problem what is a better buy a square pizza measuring inches by inches that costs &# or a round pizza with a inch diameter that also costs &# our first site was thebeehive org created by the not for profit one economy corp as a tool to help low income families the site offers easy access to information on a wide range of topics by clicking on "school" on the home page none of the other topics looked at all relevant we got right to homework help the section is divided into elementary middle and high school help our answer was just a few clicks away "math" in the high school section took us to webmath com which offered a coherent explanation of how to do the problem along with a "circle calculator" on which to do the arithmetic we went to "geometry problem solver " then to "geometry circles " and there was the formula we plugged in the information we had the diameter to get the answer the square pizza is bigger our next visit was to drexel universitys year old mathforum org the site was harder for us to navigate than the beehive site and we couldnt find an online calculator but it has a wealth of formulas as well as answers to commonly asked questions ours included the "frequently asked questions" list included everything from "what years are leap years " "how do i find the day of the week for any date " "how do i find a calendar for any year " to "what is a prime number " to those questions the site offers explanations along with sample problems and their solutions for less common questions the site offers "ask dr math " where new questions are fielded we did try asking dr math the pizza math question but we werent surprised that we never heard back the site warns that if the answer is among the most commonly asked questions and an applicable answer is already available dr math probably wont respond we also tried a logic problem but didnt hear back on that one either turns out dr math is manned by volunteers who love math if there is a volunteer who finds your problem interesting or feels that he or she can help it will be answered if not you are out of luck up next was coolmath com founded in by karen lyn davis a math teacher with a community college in orange county california mixed in with everything from how to calculate your age in dog years to an "airport calculator " which calculates distances and bearing between u s airports are some very useful tools including one that helped us calculate the area of our circular pizza our one complaint we found the multicolored shapes and numbers which jump around on the already busy web page a little distracting but our tester liked them getting our math question answered by a "live" person at sites that offer personalized tutoring however was more complicated at anytimetutor com we never did figure out how to take advantage of the "one free math session" offered on the home page even though we tried a few times there was no response to our email requests for the free session either we gave up and forked over our credit card number the cost &# per email question to be answered in up to hours &# for an answer in up to four hours &# for one hour and &# for live help again one question there is a &# minimum there are also "live chat plans " for fifteen minutes a day starting at &# for a week to &# for a month for questions we found the system confusing and the "live" support was offline the first time we checked eventually we were able to im with the "live support" person who explained the system and we emailed our question late in the afternoon our question was answered at the next morning the solution was written out but it wasnt explained in a way that really helped our tester next up was vistatutor com a bangladesh based tutoring site the company started by entrepreneur k ganesh provides a team of tutors in subjects hours a day the price averages &# per month for unlimited tutoring with an introductory month at &# but we were offered one month for &# in an email the company sent us the day after our free trial still signing up for the free trial wasnt smooth sailing we got a hard sell from the "academic coordinator" he tried to persuade us to sign up for the service before we tried it offering us a discount that was already on the web site if we signed up immediately when we said we wanted him to solve our math problem first he tried solving it and got it wrong finally he passed us to a tutor john stuppy president of tutorvista regretted that had happened but pointed out that the "academic coordinators" are sales people not tutors and that he was probably just trying to fill in at a busy time once we got to our tutor however he was a hit we could watch him solving the problem on our own computer using a virtual white board while he explained it to us over the phone had we signed up for the service we could have downloaded vistatutors voice over ip software and spoken to the tutor that way our testers reaction "that would be my pick " web site price thebeehive org free features includes information on everything from money to health to family to schools the "schools" section has math homework help through high school offering well organized lists of formulas problems useful calculators explanations and definitions ease of use once you know "schools" leads to homework help the site is easy to navigate comment we were a little surprised to find our math problem related to the area of a circle in the high school section of the site rather than middle school but once we got to the right place we liked the explanation that went with the very well designed calculator web site price mathforum org free except for homework enrichment which starts at &# per year for students and offers challenging word problems features has extensive resources for teachers and students the ask dr math section includes reviews of skills required through college offers sample problems and answers to frequently asked questions and offers to answer problems that havent already been answered on the site ease of use we didnt find any online calculators but the answers to frequently asked questions are extensive and generally easy to follow comment we found a wonderful explanation of the formula needed to solve our problem in the middle school circle part of dr math but we never heard back from dr math on the two questions we asked web site price coolmath com free features bright colors big graphics and constant movement characterize this site offers math games math lessons and fun math facts as well as offbeat calculators and "science monster " ease of use not the most efficient to use but fun to find our way around we kept checking out different things on the site while looking for the answer to our problem comment turned out our kid tester found this site long before we did hes a fan of the games on the site web site price anytimetutor com prices vary one to one private tutoring over the internet for example is &# for minutes of live help features offers one on one tutoring as well as email responses without monthly fees a range of pricing possibilities pay as you go or on a weekly or monthly basis ease of use we never figured out how to take advantage of the free math session offered and by the time the "live operator" had come on to help us we had already paid for one question comment once we figured out how to use the site we got what we needed but it was a frustrating experience we also found the pricing options too confusing no response to emailed and faxed requests for comment web site price tutorvista com free trial available then averages &# per month for unlimited tutoring with an introductory month at &# but the company sent us an email offering one month for &# features online tutoring in subjects through college options include staying with one tutor or hour availability of tutors in a majority of the subjects of the tutors have graduate degrees offers a virtual white board and the option to record each session for later review ease of use our testers top pick it was easier to understand the explanation when it was being done live watching the tutor draw out the solution on the virtual white board comment we didnt appreciate the salespersons hard sell of the sites subscription services when we signed up for our free trial but after that our experience was great corrections &amp amplifications tutorvista com is a tutoring site based in bangalore india a cranky consumer column in thursdays personal journal incorrectly gave the company name as vistatutor on first reference and mistakenly said it was based in bangladesh wsj oct
