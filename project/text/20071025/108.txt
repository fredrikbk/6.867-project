politics &amp economics role of u s oil reserve scrutinized white house criticized for boosting stores now better to put on market washington lawmakers and oil analysts want to know why the bush administration at a time of sky high oil prices insists on pumping barrels a day of some of the worlds most desirable crude into salt caverns in texas and louisiana the question centers on the countrys huge strategic petroleum reserve which now holds million barrels or enough to replace days of u s crude imports critics of the energy department argue the administration could ease concerns over lofty prices simply by not pumping additional oil into the reserve and putting the extra barrels on the market instead the debate comes amid concerns over global crude supplies and swelling demand also yesterday the federal government reported an unexpectedly large decline in commercial crude oil inventories as imports fell from the previous week sending oil up &# per barrel or to &# filling the reserve is the latest wrinkle in a larger debate over its role should the u s turn to the petroleum stash to calm oil markets as governments often increase spending when the economy slows or should it be used only in times of true crisis like another war in the middle east or a massive hurricane like katrina energy department officials say it makes sense to keep filling the reserve at the current rate they say that bush administration has no intention of changing course whether to send signals to the market or otherwise megan barnett an energy department spokeswoman said the input is "a minute amount compared to over million barrels per day consumed in the u s and over million barrels consumed globally every day " the extra oil she said "helps to provide an added layer of protection to americans in the case of a severe supply disruption " of particular interest is the growing premium buyers are now paying for low sulfur crude the mainstay of what the energy department is now pumping into the reserve from suppliers in the gulf of mexico the reserve now contains million barrels of sweet crude with the rest being the less desirable heavy sour variety "sweet" crude yields more premium refined products like gasoline "sweet crude is the chateau haut brion of oil " says philip verleger an independent energy economist based in colorado who is clamoring for the government to dip into the reserve larry goldstein director of the energy policy research foundation in washington says the crimp in sweet crude supplies "makes this an opportune time for the government to rethink its policy this would be a tinkering with the market not a tampering " six democratic senators including senate energy committee chairman jeff bingaman also want the administration to cut off further deliveries to the spr at least until oil prices taper off the senators accused energy secretary samuel bodman in a letter last week of sticking to a policy that "has exacerbated the current oil price spike " continuing to pump the oil into the ground at a time of near record prices the senators said "sends a message to the market place that the administration is comfortable with the current price levels " the government isnt paying cash for the oil instead private producers supply the government with oil as part of a royalty in kind program to pay for the right to drill in u s controlled offshore waters about million barrels a month of this royalty oil is now flowing into the reserve but skeptics argue it would be smarter for the energy department to sell the oil and buy up additional reserves when prices subside as many expect they will next year senate democrats in their letter to mr bodman argue that congress wants the department "to use a market based approach to determining when to fill the spr " u s officials say they arent continuing to fill the reserve with a particular contingency in mind the u s decided to create a petroleum reserve system right after the arab oil embargo and began filling the first salt caverns in the energy department now describes the reserve as "a significant deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool of foreign policy " the reserve has been tapped in the past for emergencies during the gulf war the government pulled million barrels president bush opened the spigots in after hurricane katrina caused massive damage to oil facilities in the gulf of mexico in putting another million barrels on the market the reserve has also offered to swap or loan oil during limited supply disruptions but president clinton in the late s turned to the reserve to address less calamitous needs citgo petroleum corp part of petroleos de venezuela and the forerunner of conocophillips together borrowed a million barrels from the reserve in june when an accident cut off supplies to two of their huge refineries in louisiana twice that same year the administration tapped the reserve to offset surging heating oil prices in the northwest the bush administration has been determined to boost the reserve which stood at million barrels in september the government expects to fill the reserve to its million barrel capacity by the end of next year at the same time the energy department is moving ahead on plans to eventually expand the reserve to a billion barrels president bush in january called for an even greater expansion to billion barrels though it is unclear whether congress would appropriate the massive sums needed to buy and store that much oil at current prices
