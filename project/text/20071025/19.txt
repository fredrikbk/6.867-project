cablevision holders reject buyout latest effort by dolans to take company private likely will be the last shareholders of cablevision systems corp voted down the dolan familys &# billion offer to take the cable operator private in an unusual display of shareholder activism given the recent credit climate the rejection testament to outside investors continued frustration with the dolans is expected to draw the curtain on the familys two year struggle to take the company private this was the dolans latest and probably last of four steadily increasing offers the most recent for &# a share in the current credit climate the family probably couldnt make another offer on par with the one just rejected in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange the shares slid or &# to &# giving the company a market capitalization of about &# billion the "no" vote also raises questions about whether the family will soon decide to sell the countrys fifth largest cable operator in terms of subscribers or some of its parts which include television networks madison square garden and the new york knicks and rangers the defeat comes as conditions on wall street are changing for dissident shareholders earlier this year they had been flexing their muscles but most of these efforts have stopped amid turmoil in the credit markets a sharp increase in the default rate of subprime mortgages sparked the turmoil making it more difficult and expensive for many companies to borrow money deals such as the buyout of txu corp which had locked in financing terms before the credit crunch have been winning approval from shareholders who fear the capital markets arent going to make such attractive terms available anytime soon cablevision was an exception to this rule many investors felt the dolans were trying to buy the company for far less than it was worth "market forces are not going to allow the dolans to steal this company from investors " said john linehan a portfolio manager at t rowe price value fund which owns a stake in the company the vote was the latest blow to the dolans who have become well known in new york for battles with mayor michael bloomberg and yankees owner george steinbrenner chief executive james dolan and his father cablevision founder and chairman charles dolan have feuded publicly in recent years over a satellite tv project that charles dolan championed last year the company got in trouble for awarding backdated options to an executive who had already died this fall the management of cablevisions madison square garden unit which is run by james dolan was tarnished by a highly publicized sexual harassment trial that ended in an &# million verdict against the company the dolans said in a written statement they were disappointed with yesterdays vote but that "in many ways it is a positive event" because it demonstrated that shareholders are confident in the companys prospects many dissident shareholders say they believe cablevision one of the countrys top performing cable operators is worth at least &# a share run on a day to day basis by chief operating officer tom rutledge the company has been a leader in rolling out digital cable phone and advanced services like interactive advertising it serves about three million households in the lucrative market of new york city and its suburbs most grating to some shareholders cablevision has begun to generate an enormous amount of free cash flow cable investors have been waiting for this to happen for years but in the past companies have launched into new rounds of capital spending every time they have reached this point with no major new investments on the horizon cablevision will generate &# million in cash this year and that figure will rise to &# billion in according to a projection by sanford c bernstein &amp co "thats something all shareholders should benefit from including the dolans " said christopher marangi an analyst with gabelli &amp co a unit of gamco investors inc which owns an stake in cablevision dissident shareholders say they hope cablevision will share the cash with them in the form of dividends and share repurchases some would also like to see the company sell some of its noncable assets mr marangi estimates the company could get &# billion for its three cable networks alone amc ifc and we and &# billion for its madison square garden division which includes the teams and the famed arena shareholders also expect the dolans eventually will sell the cable operation to a larger company for a premium over the familys latest offer time warner cable inc which owns adjacent systems in the new york city region and has expressed interest in buying cablevision is considered a top candidate the dolans have long said cablevision of bethpage n y isnt for sale james dolan issued a statement last week that he was "completely prepared to continue to lead the company into the future as a public company if the transaction is not approved " the dolans launched their privatization effort in with an offer to buy the cable units and spin off the other assets in a deal valued at &# a share the family later rescinded that offer and pushed through a special dividend of &# a share in they tried again with a &# a share bid which they increased to &# a few months later but the family couldnt negotiate a deal with a special committee formed by the board of directors the special committee approved the latest bid in may noting that it represented a premium to the familys &# a share offer the previous year but some large investors immediately protested claiming the company could get much more by putting itself on the block not all investors opposed the dolans latest bid some voted in favor noting that the financing commitments the family obtained last spring would be unobtainable in todays volatile credit market that makes it very unlikely the dolans would be able to make another similar offer supporters of the deal also have raised concerns about the competition cablevision faces from verizon communications inc which has targeted the new york city region with its new fiber optic network named fios but opponents felt the dolans wouldnt have bid &# unless they were convinced that the company was worth much more "its very obvious that the dolans arent remotely worried about fios " said jeremy hosking co founder of marathon asset management ltd a london based investment management company that voted against the deal
