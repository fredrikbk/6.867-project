in mckesson some foresee value lesson drug distribution firm has makings of winner low debt and buybacks mckesson corp shares are inexpensive the company has well respected management and it sports a great balance sheet the drug distributor operates in an industry that should hold up nicely even if the economy slows making it something of a perfect value stock so whats the problem rough comparisons with last year suggest that earnings are unlikely to impress wall street during the rest of this year but some smart investors say the best time to scoop up shares of a company like mckesson is when they are ignored and before a profit pickup is at hand these investors including some top hedge funds and private equity firms say mckesson which has a market value of about &# billion might even be a takeover candidate if the merger game heats up again at a recent charity event in new york during which a group of prominent hedge fund and private equity players shared their best investments picks mckesson was the only stock for which the honchos shared an affection larry robbins founder of the &# billion hedge fund firm glenview capital argued that wall streets profit expectations are too low and that mckesson has so little debt it could borrow money to boost its current share buyback program the san francisco company is one of glenviews largest holdings some say
