terror vs democracy in pakistan after more than a decade in exile benazir bhutto a former prime minister of pakistan returned home to karachi last week to throngs of cheering supporters her triumphal arrival was marred by a terrorist bombing that killed more than people and underscored this fact terrorism is a threat to pakistan and its people and not merely a response to the foreign policy of a distant superpower for too many pakistanis this is a hard fact to accept many seem to believe that the war on terrorism is americas war and that if it did not stand with the u s then pakistan would be safe from attack this is not true pakistan has been a terrorist target since the s when its security services got involved in proxy wars in afghanistan and kashmir a compilation of published figures shows the trends in people were killed in terrorist attacks in pakistan of these were civilians were security personnel and were terrorists thats an increase over when the number of fatalities was much lower civilians terrorists and security personnel this year terrorists stepped up their attacks even before ms bhuttos return in the first months of the year a reported people were killed the number of suicide bombings in pakistan is also up compared to previous years pakistan clearly has a terrorist problem and needs to fight the organizations that carry out these attacks for the sake of its own people the willingness of the united states to provide economic and military aid for fighting terrorism is incidental those who punish men for not growing a beard or who wish to subjugate women or who behead human beings like animals are not open to persuasion they will not stop if pakistan were to distance itself from the u s the attack against ms bhutto reflects a deep seated anger among global jihadis who shake at the thought of a woman leading the worlds only nuclear armed majority muslim country its not the first time this anger has been directed at ms bhutto when she was elected prime minister for the first time in fatwas were issued by radical clerics condemning her and the decision to elect her ramzi yousef mastermind of the attack on new yorks world trade center has also admitted to plotting an attack on ms bhutto in ms bhutto is clearly a brave and courageous woman who cannot and will not be deterred easily by either the threats of terrorists or the machinations of those within pakistans covert security services who have consistently conspired against her even after the attacks ms bhutto did not change her stance against terror nor did she back away from her demand for restoration of democracy and free and fair elections ms bhuttos suspicion is that certain elements within pakistans ruling establishment might be behind the bid to kill her these fears should not be disregarded even though it is difficult for gen pervez musharraf to accept that some of his close friends and associates may be complicit or tolerant of mass murder ms bhuttos fears come from almost two decades of being hounded by jihadis and their allies in pakistans security establishment its crucial for pakistan to address her concerns mr musharraf needs to open his heart to genuine democracy and that must include listening to the complaints lodged by the peoples representatives against his friends and allies in the establishment in any case mr musharraf has wasted six critical years in the war against terrorism by failing to purge the government and intelligence services of hard liners who supported jihadis in the past and who have maneuvered behind the scenes to stop true democrats from gaining power the massive demonstration of support for ms bhutto and her pakistan peoples party last thursday confirms that her popularity remains undiminished by the political developments of the past two decades before ms bhuttos return the conventional wisdom offered by many pundits and some politicians was this ms bhutto is seen to be too pro american and too pro musharraf to be popular in pakistan but neither of these suggestions nor the charges of corruption and misrule that have been repeatedly lodged against her over the past years seemed to carry much weight with the millions of people enthused about ms bhuttos return from americas point of view the good news is that the people who were cheering in the streets of pakistan for ms bhutto will likely cheer against terrorism under a government run by her pakistans war against terrorism will likely make better progress with the support of the people than it has in recent years under an embattled military dictator mr haqqani is director of boston universitys center for international relations and author of "pakistan between mosque and military" carnegie endowment for international peace he has also served as an adviser to several pakistani prime ministers including ms bhutto
