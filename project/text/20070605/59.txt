new drugs show promise for liver cancer liver cancer is a complex disease that for decades has stymied researchers hunting for treatments that has left patients with few options and one of the poorest prognoses of all cancers but now a number of drugs are on the horizon that could be the first to show promise in liver cancer furthest along is nexavar a pill currently approved as a kidney cancer treatment and headed for regulatory review for use in liver cancer this year yesterday scientists reported at a big meeting of cancer doctors that nexavar improved survival time by nearly three months a significant advance since liver cancer patients typically have just months to live after diagnosis at least two other drugs sutent and avastin are also advancing in tests against liver cancer the drugs are part of wave of so called targeted treatments that seek out specific aspects of cancer cells or tumors in particular research has been spurred by the discovery that certain "anti angiogenic" drugs which block blood vessels that nourish tumors can work in liver cancer drug companies have also been lured by the high prices cancer drugs can command these days running &# or more a year and a generally faster regulatory approval process for life saving treatments liver cancer which often follows organ damage due to hepatitis b hepatitis c or cirrhosis of the liver is one of the few malignancies for which the death rate is increasing the number of cases in the u s has roughly doubled in the past years due largely to the rise in hepatitis c before modern blood screening currently about americans die of liver cancer each year and some estimates put the number of people at risk for the disease in the u s at four million more than people a year world wide die of it because it is essentially two diseases in one liver cancer is particularly hard to treat patients with organ damage may be more fragile and less able to tolerate toxic chemotherapy options have included surgery to remove tumors liver transplant radioactive beads inserted into the cancer site or off label use of chemotherapy drugs for direct injection into liver arteries doctors have also had some luck with "chemo embolization" threading a catheter directly into an artery to bathe the liver with chemo such techniques can buy time until a transplant but waiting lists for donor organs are long "this has been the third rail of oncology " says alan venook professor of clinical medicine at the university of california at san francisco and a former consultant to nexavar maker onyx pharmaceuticals inc with no current ties to the company or drug "nothing seemed to work " there have been about trials over the past years looking at liver cancer treatments without success according to joseph llovet the nexavar study lead researcher and director of liver cancer research at mount sinai school of medicine in new york for that reason yesterdays report on the nexavar study at the american society of clinical oncologys annual meeting in chicago was "really a breakthrough " he says the study looked at patients with advanced liver cancer about half received nexavar and the other half received a placebo or fake treatment patients receiving nexavar had a median overall survival of months compared with months in the placebo arm the study was considered so successful that it was halted earlier this year and patients in the placebo group were offered nexavar dr llovet said a statistical analysis of the results showed the effect of nexavar translates into a improvement in overall survival but the survival extension isnt a cure the drug also carries a risk of side effects including intestinal upset rashes and thinning hair and like most new cancer drugs it will be pricey nexavar sold by onyx of emeryville calif and germanys bayer ag costs just under &# a month or nearly &# a year the company says it offers assistance to patients without health coverage nexavar began life as a drug designed to interrupt proliferation of cancer cells in a case of scientific serendipity doctors found it also blocked vessels to the tumor "it was a twist " says onyx ceo hollings renton onyxs partner bayer tweaked the formula to boost potency and turn it into an oral pill in fda approved it for kidney cancer based on a patient study showed nexavar doubled progression free survival to six months from three months nexavar hit the u s market in early robert fullerton who was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer last year has been taking nexavar since january doctors had removed part of his liver but follow up scans discovered spots on the remaining part of the organ his surgeon david geller a co director of the university of pittsburgh medical centers liver cancer center was also concerned that since mr fullertons tumor had burst cancer cells may have spread dr geller says he was aware of earlier studies suggesting nexavar might work in liver cancer so he decided to put mr fullerton on the drug and helped persuade insurance to pay for nexavar mr fullerton who lives in pittsburgh and works for a welding equipment company says he has been taking nexavar twice a day without any problems except for feeling tired and since he has been on nexavar ct scans have shown the tumors in his liver have not grown he says he feels "fortunate" to have nexavar especially when he visits the liver cancer center and sees patients "with ports in their arms and their hair is coming out and here im taking pills " two other liver cancer rivals also are in testing genentech inc s avastin a vessel blocking drug already approved to treat colorectal cancer and lung cancer has been found in three small midstage studies to be active against advanced liver cancer alone or in combination with another genentech drug called tarceva avastin toxicity can include bleeding gastrointestinal perforations or problems with wound healing pfizer inc s sutent is already marketed for kidney cancer and is in midstage studies against liver cancer sutent also works by inhibiting angiogenesis the growth of blood vessels and tumor cell growth albeit by a slightly different pathway than nexavar besides gastrointestinal problems and mouth sores it also can cause heart problems both drugs have gone through phase tests and are headed toward the larger phase studies needed for fda approval so they are close behind nexavar however both companies say it is too soon to predict when they might expect to get fda approval until phase studies are successfully completed with nexavar onyx plans to file for u s and european licensure "imminently " says mr renton the onyx ceo the company is aiming for fda approval in liver cancer by early most cancer treatments eventually evolve into a combination regimen onyx already successfully tested nexavar in combination with the chemo drug adriamycin also known as doxorubicin and the study was discontinued at recommendation of a data monitoring board after the combo was found superior to chemo alone the company said onyx plans more combination studies coupling nexavar with surgery and chemo the company hopes one day to make nexavar part of other chemotherapy combos because its toxicity profile is different from most chemo and it wont compound the bone marrow suppression often found with standard chemo drugs in the pipeline drugs that are showing promise for liver cancer nexavar approved for kidney cancer a new study showed it improved survival in liver cancer by nearly three months avastin approved for colorectal and lung cancer midstage studies show it to be active against liver cancer sutent approved for kidney cancer in midstage studies for liver cancer
