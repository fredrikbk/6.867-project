ghibertis doors are heavenly again atlanta if michelangelos "david" heads the "must see" list of renaissance masterpieces for most visitors to florence then i suspect "the gates of paradise " lorenzo ghibertis monumental doors of the baptistery of san giovanni rank a close second the foot tall portal exquisitely articulated gilt bronze reliefs of old testament scenes framed by standing prophets foliage and projecting heads has mesmerized viewers since its completion in michelangelo himself is supposed to have given the doors the name by which they are still known despite this acclaim the history of the "gates of paradise" has been troubled in addition to being outdoors for more than years theyve been subjected to decades of polishing and campaigns of well meaning but brutal "restoration " plus "improvements" imposed by changing taste and outright vandalism six panels were wrenched free of their moorings by the florence flood of november worst of all was exposure to the corrosive polluted urban atmosphere which loosened the layer of gilding and threatened to destroy the bronze itself eager tourists gazing at the dull darkened surfaces of ghibertis masterwork hoping to see what michelangelo admired so intensely had to work hard even to decipher the subject matter much less to appreciate the fabled nuances of the reliefs next year visitors to florence will again see "the gates" restored to their full splendor permanently installed in the museo dellopera del duomo as with other fragile antiquities and renaissance works replicas have been placed in situ until early next year three of the restored panels along with two of the standing figures and heads from the surrounding framework can be seen on this side of the atlantic at the high museum atlanta through july the art institute of chicago july to oct and the metropolitan museum of art new york oct to jan this fascinating little exhibition offers an extraordinary opportunity to see ghibertis work with unprecedented never to be repeated intimacy first time viewers will be entranced old renaissance hands will discover things theyve never seen before its informative revealing and thrilling meticulous work using the most exacting new technology and spanning years about as long as it took ghiberti to make the original doors has brought the reliefs back to their original brilliance revealing details and subtleties and providing scholars with a wealth of information about their history the exhibition includes a good deal of documentary material including a riveting video showing various conservation methods most remarkable is the cleaning in situ with a laser a first a bit of magic made possible by the different reflective properties of the original gilded surface and the noxious accretions more details art historical and technical are in the excellent catalog any doubt about the value of these interventions is dispelled by the pairing of an unrestored figure and head from the surround with their gleaming counterparts details of expression delicate inflections of drapery and variations of "drawing " invisible in the untreated sculptures become plainly apparent in their treated counterparts bringing them to life the core of the show is of course the three glowing panels "adam and eve " "david" and "jacob and esau " we can study how dramatically ghiberti orchestrated forms from high relief figures projected free of the surface to barely defined images and everything in between to evoke different locations in space we can revel in the expressive modeling and in the range of characterizations throughout we can become entranced by minuscule details such as the birds in he canopies of trees in "adam and eve " or the tiny plants and lizards on the rocks below impossible to see when the panel is in its normal top row position feet up most compelling perhaps is ghibertis ability to suggest the passage of time compressing an entire narrative into a few crucial images the creation of adam the creation of eve the fall and the expulsion for example and to suggest sequence and space by two dimensional placement something he may have learned from the precocious florentine painter masaccio variations in depth intensify the narrative the newly created adam projects abruptly while eve emerges from his side in medium relief and the fall is barely incised driven from eden the pair project once more as they enter the space of our world each image is conceived differently apparently in response to location "adam and eve " meant to be seen from a distance is clear and geometric "david " intended for the bottom row is a welter of complicated textures and patterns we are meant to look down at the shepherd boy as he decapitates goliath framed by struggling armies with the top of the panel filled with buildings traced in drawing like low relief "jacob and esau " at eye level entails a few bold characters against a severe architectural background in elaborate perspective its all enthralling and well never see it like this again ms wilkin is the curator of "color as field american painting " opening this fall at the denver art museum
