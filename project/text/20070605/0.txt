piggyback investors at risk rising defaults of mortgage loans pinch bondholders this little piggy went to market and into default rising defaults are scary for investors in bonds backed by subprime loans but at least they have the comfort of knowing it will take a year or two for losses to hit one type of mortgage bond investor isnt so lucky those holding bonds backed by "piggyback" loans or second mortgages that are taken out at the same time as primary loans by borrowers who have little or no money for a down payment get hit with losses much sooner the whole balance of piggyback loans gets written off as soon as borrowers default once they are around three to six months behind on monthly payments in may washington mutual bank took a charge of &# million from a mortgage securitization long beach mortgage loan trust a the losses on the loans which were delinquent for six months represented almost of the bonds original principal balance for bonds backed by first mortgages in contrast the losses arent written down until the bank sells the foreclosed properties even then there is a good chance bondholders will recuperate around half the original balance piggyback bond issuance ballooned during the housing boom moodys investors service rated &# billion in below prime piggyback deals in up from &# billion in when home prices rose the piggyback bonds performed well but in recent months these bonds have succumbed to the pressures of a slower housing market as a result rating companies have downgraded bonds and in some cases investors have taken losses "losses have come in earlier than expected and higher than expected " said grant bailey a senior director in fitch ratings residential mortgage backed securities group so far no fitch rated investment grade piggyback bonds have suffered such losses but "its probably only a matter of months until they do " mr bailey said piggyback mortgage loans are considered riskier than primary home loans in the case of default on either the first or second mortgage the primary mortgage loan always is paid back first that is why the whole balance of piggyback loans gets written off once borrowers default the risk of default always is higher for borrowers with piggyback loans because they have little or no equity in their properties that can make it difficult to refinance their loans if they find themselves having trouble making payments especially if home prices fall also while piggyback bonds are designed with extra padding to absorb losses as are many nonprime mortgage bonds the cushion for piggyback bonds is expected to be built up over time as the bonds age however if there are a significant number of defaults early on the cushion never ramps up to its expected size for nonprime piggyback bonds issued in the percentage of borrowers who were three months behind on their payments after one year was nearly double the rate in according to a moodys report the surge in defaults and downgrades on the bonds is due to a combination of a weaker housing environment and lax underwriting standards said moodys analysts aron bergman and gulmira karaguishiyeva in a recent report lenders already have responded by introducing stricter standards either by requiring more documentation or in some cases eliminating piggyback loans altogether this should "result in better credit loans and better performance " mr bailey said freddie fannie futures due by years end u s futures exchange said it plans by the end of the year to launch futures contracts tied to the debt of fannie mae and freddie mac representing the chicago exchanges first foray into the credit derivatives market the credit default swap futures will be linked to the debt of the federal agencies which
