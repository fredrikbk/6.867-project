the game game theories calling the end of cheap debt crisis of confidence death by drowning a slow clean leak the waves of debt feeding todays buyout deluge will eventually recede nows the time to figure out what will make that happen this has become the essential question on wall street where even the cocksure ranks of banks hedge funds and private equity firms have begun to doubt lenient standards for lending and deal making as bank of americas own chief ken lewis admitted recently "we are close to a time when well look back and say we did some stupid things " you couldnt tell now junk rated corporate loan default rates are at their lowest rate ever about times less than historical rates of according to standard &amp poors the markets have changed dramatically since when a busted deal for united airlines chilled the debt markets for years on end at the core of the change is the term "liquidity " a catch all meaning theres lots of money in the markets for anyone who

network of hyperinformed investors moving money from dubai geneva or greenwich into ever more specialized investments need a few billion in a few days someone somewhere will fill your tank will this global liquidity actually minimize the impact of the inevitable credit downturn or is it in fact only feeding a bubble we wont know until it happens but theories have begun to form around three different scenarios the big one this is the realm of the capital letter meant to express outsize effect the asian currency crisis or the russian financial crisis as this theory goes some big event flips investor confidence in an instant drying up capital as investors flee to safe havens these are by their very nature unpredictable and devastating right now credit markets are at the other end of this spectrum bond investors demand next to nothing to own corporate debt the difference in yield between a risky b rated junk bond and an ultrasafe treasury is just percentage points the lowest spread on record its a sign of investors high tolerance for risk the big event causes them to quickly reassess this tolerance dumping corporate bonds and pushing out spreads in an instant while we have become deeply attuned to the big one we have also become increasingly adaptable to them sept of course was a widely destabilizing force but from a business perspective it contributed to years of low interest rates that set the tone for todays lending free for all by the time terrorists targeted london in july the markets shrugged off the effects if the subprime lending mess is a crisis it surely has not spread to the broader stock market which is posting record highs by the day "for this to come down it has to be something of major major proportions " says dennis drebsky a bankruptcy and litigation partner at nixon peabody in new york death by drowning in this scenario the pullback doesnt come from one outsize event instead lenders and borrowers slowly choke on their own largess lenders prop up many companies in a series of refinancings heaping new debt on old eventually lenders would be compelled to tighten their standards thats whats happened in the housing market today a recent survey of restructuring advisers by alixpartners found "theres unlikely to be a crash and more of a gradual increase in companies that just cant refinance the fourth time around " says peter

is one of many firms that have secured the most popular trend in lending now known as the "covenant lite revolver " revolvers are bank loans usually drawn down as a companys last resort this is the very moment a lender might want to keep a tight hold on its money using covenants that test the companys creditworthiness and performance the covenant lite variety has fewer of those tests as one banker put it its like a car thats begun to swerve and ends off the road entirely before anyone can intervene "the problem is that you put securities like that in a capital structure and it doesnt instill the discipline to manage their business " says david resnick a longtime restructuring adviser at rothschild north america the slow leak the slow leak theory is the most benign of the scenarios its based around the idea that annual private equity returns will gradually decline slowly ending todays ferocious buyout binge which comprises a third of todays record mergers volume as private equity firms adapt theyll pull back the reins on their borrowing ending the debt boom before it gets too messy investing has already gotten harder for the private equity groups which face hostile
