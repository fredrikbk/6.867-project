listen to music free but pay to carry the music industry is so desperate for new ways to make money that a silicon valley start up is trying a counterintuitive approach giving the music away as a way to jump start sales starting today visitors to palo alto based lala media inc s lala com web site will be able to listen for free on their computers to the digital catalog of warner music group corp and hundreds of smaller independent music companies lala executives say they are working to secure licenses with the other three major music companies its like a subscription music service but without the monthly subscription fee lala is betting that in return for getting all that free access to music at home listeners will pay to buy the songs they want to take with them on ipods and other music players the prices will range from &# to &# for an album for now lala plans to sell music only by the album rather than song by song lala whose owners include bain capital llc and several veteran silicon valley investors is underwriting the free offering by paying major labels &# to &# a user each month about the same wholesale rate paid by online music subscription services like realnetworks inc s rhapsody but where rhapsody and its competitors charge users &# a month for "all you can eat streaming " lala com will charge nothing and where rhapsody and its competitors require users to load special and occasionally glitchy programs to access their offerings lala will work through a normal web browser users of lalas web based service can create and save playlists send them to friends and browse the virtual collections of other users all for free more important still the new service will work with apple inc s ipods something no itunes competitor featuring major label content has been able to do the latter feature addresses one of the music industrys chief complaints in the digital era most music sold by rivals of apples itunes store cant be played on the ipod the gadget that represents an estimated to of the u s market in digital music players thats because apple uses copy protection software but wont license it to others historically record labels have been reluctant to sell music without such protection though emi group plc recently began selling unprotected downloads through various services lala gets around the copy protection issue because once a user loads the songs on an ipod via lala they cant be moved any place else the beleaguered music industry has often been resistant to new ideas during its seven year sales slide label executives say one of the features they find most compelling in lalas new service is the fact that it allows users to download songs directly from a web page into their ipods without using itunes software music companies believe the workaround will make lala more appealing than competing music stores that work with non ipod players on top of that label executives say they are happy that a "discovery" site has found a way to charge users "if you give consumers a great and very flexible sampling experience that generates a tremendous amount of commerce " says alex zubillaga executive vice president for digital strategy at warner music when a user plugs an ipod or music enabled mobile phone into a pc he or she will be given the option of loading music directly into the device for a fee the service keeps tabs on a users music collection even songs they acquired from itunes or elsewhere so if someones home hard drive contains a particular song lala will enable that customer to download the song to an ipod for free from any computer connected to the web the company believes its business model will succeed because the ubiquity of mobile phones and other gadgets that can play music provides such a growth market lala founder bill nguyen who has become wealthy by starting and selling a string of other technology companies calls the lala gambit an "all in" proposition readily acknowledging that if it fails his company will most likely go under the company expects a loss of about &# million over the next two years a sum it is in the process of raising in a new financing round mr nguyen keeps the sock puppet mascot of the defunct pets com on his desk "as a reminder " he says of what can happen to a dot com company the risks include enabling lala customers to circumvent the proprietary itunes software that may be viewed by apple as a provocation spokespeople for apple didnt respond to requests for comment in addition lalas plan to sell music only as albums without giving users the option to buy individual songs could also turn off potential buyers in fact mr nguyen says he justifies the policy only on aesthetic grounds as a fan he prefers to consume music by the album he says he has so far resisted tremendous pressure from employees and even label executives to sell individual songs lalas pricing model too runs counter to the way the music industry has done things prices will be "dynamic " or based on demand for a particular title and other factors including the existing content of a users personal music library typically labels use low prices to drive music discovery often subsidizing big discounts for brand new albums on the theory that generating word of mouth interest will provide momentum in the future they also sometimes cut prices on blocks of older titles during special promotions but for most older albums they often charge a premium figuring that people buying older music are less likely to be doing so on a whim after for example hearing the song on the radio lala by contrast plans to use its variable pricing system as more of a customer loyalty program low prices will be used as "a reward not an enticement " mr nguyen says "its like the las vegas comp system the more you buy the better deals you get " mr nguyen the company doesnt use titles but he is effectively chief executive says he aims to be as big as the itunes store in months to two years he hopes to do so not by poaching apples customers but by recruiting new ones "lala is about moving the of the market thats still buying cds over to digital " mr nguyen says "getting itunes customers onto lala would be pointless " lala coms roots are in another web based business that aims to match up buyers and sellers of used cds it has active subscribers who list what cds they are willing to swap and which ones they want to acquire executing such trades costs a dollar a transaction data on supply and demand dynamics in that market were critical in designing the digital only offering lala executives say the lala site already features an internet radio service that with their characteristic gung ho spirit mr nguyen and his engineers built from scratch company employees spent weeks manning a jerry rigged station they used to rip cds bought just for the occasion thats the equivalent of the biggest tower records locations in the chains heyday and several times more titles than the average best buy co location sells
