calling the shots in murdochs career a hand on the news his aggressive style can blur boundaries buck stops with me as rupert murdoch advances in his bid to buy the wall street journal and its parent dow jones &amp co a central issue is whether he will preserve the independence of its news operations and keep his own views and commercial interests from coloring what appears in the papers news pages since his &# billion offer became public last month some members of the bancroft family which controls dow jones have expressed skepticism about his promise to preserve the papers independence another big shareholder james ottaway jr declared that mr murdoch has long "expressed his personal political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations " even as the family shifted last week from opposing the bid and met with mr murdoch yesterday to discuss his offer it began talking about ways to set up a mechanism for safeguarding the papers editorial independence a detailed examination of mr murdochs half century career as a journalist and businessman shows that his newspapers and other media outlets have made coverage decisions that advanced the interests of his sprawling media conglomerate news corp in the process mr murdoch has blurred a line that exists at many other u s media companies between business and news sides a line intended to keep the business and political interests of owners from influencing the presentation of news mr murdochs focus on news corp s bottom line has often allowed market considerations to influence editorial moves and different markets have led to starkly different approaches in the u s fox news has thrived by tilting to the right filling a niche left open by its network and cable rivals in italy a hour television news channel launched by mr murdoch in has positioned itself as a relatively reliable and objective source of news in contrast to the political bias of italys more established channels at all newspapers owners have a say in broad editorial direction mr murdoch has a long history of being unusually aggressive reflecting his roots as an old fashioned press baron from his earliest days like some other newspaper proprietors of the last century he ran his companies with his hands directly on the daily product peppering reporters and editors with suggestions and criticisms in an interview in his new york office on friday the australian born magnate spoke openly about his hands on style "when a paper starts to go bad and go down the drain the buck stops with me " he said shareholders "never ring the editor they ring me " he said adding that has "once or twice" led to "very unhappy but necessary decisions" to replace editors he said that if he buys the journal "id love to wander around i think people quite like it if i show interest in their work " he added "i cant put &# billion of my shareholders money and not be able to run the business " but he said he has no plans to interfere with the news operation including stories about news corp "id complain like hell if they were incorrect " he said "youd have to run what you like " several current news corp editors including robert thomson of the times in london and john witherow of the sunday times say mr murdoch has never tried to influence coverage or interfere in their running of the newspapers as mr murdochs empire has grown the year old proprietor says he has less time to devote to talking to his editors "the frustration of my life has been as the company has grown bigger and weve taken opportunities ive had less time to pay any detailed attention to" his newspapers he said over the years mr murdoch and his lieutenants have raised hackles for their involvement in the companys news operations former top editors at two of his london papers for example say he ignored an independent board set up to protect them from his interference and got involved directly in firings in the s in australia the former editor of one of his top papers complains that a news corp executive pushed him for critical coverage of pilots in a strike that was hurting a news corp airline investment in china former employees say mr murdochs representatives occasionally pushed reporters to do more upbeat stories at a time when news corp was seeking government help to expand its reach there the reporters there didnt listen and kept up their often critical coverage just last month news corp s daily telegraph sydneys largest newspaper devoted more than half its front page to news corp s own plan to lower carbon emissions an accompanying editorial proclaimed that mr murdoch "has never set a standard more worthy of following " david penberthy the papers editor says he was "proud" of its coverage shown a copy of the daily telegraph stories mr murdoch laughed and said "i dont know anything about that and we sure didnt do that in the new york post which im closest to " asked if the sydney papers coverage that day was in effect promoting news corp he replied "absolutely shouldnt be thats bad " mr murdochs vision and appetite for risk have created a global media empire unlike any other starting with a single australian newspaper he inherited from his father in today it includes more than papers in australia britain the u s fiji and papua new guinea twentieth century fox film the fox tv network harpercollins publishers and the popular myspace internet site in the four quarters ended march encompassing parts of two fiscal years for the company new york based news corp reported a total of &# billion in revenue and &# billion in net income but mr murdoch the son of a prominent australian journalist still views himself as a newsman "ive been a newspaper person since i was a baby practically and i just love newspapers " he says even before he owned any media properties he had strong views about how papers should be run shortly before starting his studies at oxford university in he traveled to britain to work as an intern at the birmingham gazette at the end of his stint he wrote to the head of the papers owner westminster press he denounced the gazettes reserved editor charles fenby as incompetent and urged that he be fired says the late editors son jonathan fenby mr fenby kept his job and laughed off the episode recalls his son who also became an editor "i should never have wrote that letter " mr murdoch says laughing "it was correct mind you what i wrote i wont take it back " at the start of his career in the s and s he was a fixture in his australian newsrooms offering both welcome and unwelcome advice to his reporters pushing story angles discussing political coverage and passing along tips such behavior wasnt deemed particularly unusual richard farmer a political correspondent who once worked for two of mr murdochs papers says he could be a "bully" when pushing for a story but was also known to back off when journalists pushed back occasionally he penned stories for his papers in he wrote what he says was a "terrific scoop" for the australian news corp s national paper about an iraqi loan scandal involving a former australian prime minister gough whitlam his story carried the byline "a special correspondent " without his name mr murdoch says that among his sources was another politician who later became prime minister the story sparked an uproar among mr whitlams supporters who arranged a boycott of the paper that cost it thousands of readers the lost circulation "took a long time to get back " mr murdoch says mr murdoch acquired his first american papers in the morning san antonio express and afternoon news the morning paper boosted its coverage of local politics and government while the afternoon paper veered into sensationalism lurid advertising boards expanded street sales "midget robs undertaker at midnight " "aliens fought over urine in desert battle " and "vampire killer stalks city " mr murdoch later toned down the gore faltering before mr murdoch acquired them the two papers overtook a dominant local rival they later merged in he bought the new york post a liberal leaning tabloid in manhattan that mixed crime reporting with coverage of more serious issues he made the paper more sensational and its editorials conservative "in the beginning when he first took over he was there like almost every day " says michael j berlin a reporter at the post from to "he would go out to the composing room his sleeves rolled up trying to get more pizzazz into the paper " roger wood then the papers editor says that whenever he went on vacation mr murdoch "would edit the paper " new yorks feisty tabloids the post and the daily news have a long tradition of bashing one another under mr murdoch the post frequently disparaged the daily news and wrote about the finances of its owner mortimer zuckerman calling him "suck up zuck" in one prominent headline in the post ran a two page spread about fox newss opening of its manhattan studio with photos of mr murdoch new york mayor rudolph giuliani fox news chairman roger ailes and other celebrities one story began "politicians celebrities and journalists gathered under one festive tent last night to toast sixth avenues newest and newsiest showcase the fox news channel " mr murdoch said on friday "were all in it together were a pretty close company they didnt do it to say lets suck up to murdoch theyd like to see it succeed probably " that same year the post took aim at ted turner when time warner inc declined to carry news corp s fox news channel on its new york cable systems mr turner had just sold turner broadcasting the owner of foxs rival cable news network to time warner "is ted turner nuts you decide " read the posts front page headline on oct the accompanying article discussed mr turners role in time warners decision the headline wasnt mr murdochs idea according to then editor ken chandler "well we were in a war " says mr murdoch of the coverage he says he approved of using the post to go after mr turner but hastens to add "youre talking about the daily new york post in the same breath as the wall street journal theyre not the same " a few years after he had planted his flag in new york mr murdoch moved to pursue a more sober brand of journalism in london where he already owned a pair of racy papers his bid to buy the times and sunday times raised some of the same concerns about preserving editorial independence and integrity that have come up in connection with his bid for the wall street journal in london mr murdoch agreed to give extra powers to independent directors on the papers board the six independent members are charged with protecting the two papers editors in chief from interference by the owners "in expressing opinion or in reporting news that might directly or indirectly conflict with the opinions or interests of any of the newspaper proprietors " according to the newspapers articles of association the six board members are supposed to have approval over the hiring and firing of the top editors who in turn are supposed to have sole control over staffing decisions mr murdoch is not supposed to give directions to any journalist except each papers top editor in a letter to the bancroft family last month mr murdoch proposed a board "exactly along the lines of" the one he established in london for the wall street journal mr murdoch made these promises as a condition of avoiding a british government review of the purchase john biffen then the secretary of state for trade cleared the deal in part because of the guarantee of editors independence mr biffen says now that the guarantee was a "fig leaf" to blunt criticism that the government in approving the deal was granting mr murdoch too much power the government he says didnt consider mr murdochs promises all that important several former editors of the london papers describe the independent board as ineffective although they say that in recent years mr murdoch has left the newspapers alone sir robin mountfield a current independent director says the board acts like a "fleet in being " a naval term for warships that never leave port but still pose a threat to the enemy frank giles who edited the sunday times from to says the board "had very little power or will to protect the independence of the papers they were appointed to safeguard " in his autobiography "sundry times " mr giles wrote that mr murdoch ordered him in january to replace the papers magazine editor with an editor from the news of the world an apparent violation of his promise not to dictate staffing changes mr giles says he reluctantly made the moves pretending to the papers staff they were his idea he says he didnt appeal to the independent directors because he believed it wouldnt have helped mr murdoch denies he ordered the change saying "franks gone nuts " fred emery a former times assistant editor says mr murdoch called him into his office in march and said he was considering firing times editor harold evans mr emery says he reminded mr murdoch of his promise that editors couldnt be fired without the independent directors approval "god you dont take all that seriously do you " mr murdoch answered according to mr emery mr emery says he replied "of course we do " according to mr emery mr murdoch laughed and said "why wouldnt i give instructions to the times when i give instructions to editors all around the world " mr evans was eventually forced out by mr murdoch on friday mr murdoch said his recollection of the conversation was that mr emery "was extremely critical of harry " mr emery responds "having summoned me to this meeting it is rather odd that mr murdoch remembers only my criticisms but not his own statements about the firm promises he had given to the british government" about the papers editorial independence by the mid s mr murdoch had given up his australian citizenship and become an american but he stayed very active in his native land meeting regularly with editors local politicians and others at his familys ranch near canberra in he won a bitter takeover battle for a major australian newspaper chain a company his father had once run giving him a dominant position in the countrys print media industry two former murdoch editors say mr murdochs longtime lieutenant in australia ken cowley pressured them to play down stories harmful to ansett an australian airline then half owned by news corp when the countrys airline pilots went on a long strike in mr cowley "wanted me to be against the pilots " recalls frank devine then editor of the australian who says he favored a more neutral approach that led to a "running feud" with mr cowley he says in december mr cowley fired him mr devine says he wasnt told why although he contends it was "mainly because of our coverage of the pilots strike " mr murdoch responds "i dont know about that at all " he says of mr devine who also edited two other murdoch owned papers "frank was a mistake of mine " mr cowley said in an email that he didnt put any pressure on editors about ansett coverage and mr devine wasnt removed because of the ansett coverage more than a decade ago news corp s australian unit struck a marketing agreement with the australian football league in which some of news corp s australian papers promised a minimum amount of news coverage of the sport according to the afl and news corp promising coverage in return for anything of value is forbidden by many publications which regard it as advertising masquerading as news a group led by a news corp unit later won rights to televise league games for several years john hartigan chairman of news corp s australian unit news ltd says he sees no problem with the arrangement "all it was is a matter of allowing them to be guaranteed that the sport would be covered in the newspaper " he says says mr murdoch "i have no knowledge of that at all we certainly would never do that " although mr murdoch had become a formidable force in the english language media world he was itching to expand further moving into asia latin america and parts of europe was more difficult due in part to language and cultural differences in mr murdoch focused on building a television satellite business in asia by buying a controlling stake in satellite broadcaster star tv his new clout in asian satellite television drew widely reported criticism from malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad malaysia did not yet have a consumer satellite tv service but it was a potentially lucrative future market for mr murdoch because it had lots of english speakers who might like stars english language channels news corp s sunday times published articles alleging a british company was prepared to bribe malaysian officials to win a construction contract according to sunday timess editor at that time andrew neil mr murdoch called him and complained that he was "boring people" and that he should stop the coverage mr neil said the row damaged his relations with mr murdoch and contributed to his decision to leave the paper for a job on a new tv show in the u s on mr murdochs fox network the show never went beyond pilot episodes and mr neil left news corp mr murdoch says the malaysian prime minister never complained to him about the stories but mr murdoch says he did criticize them to mr neil "i remember the story which they tried to run and run and run i said are you sure of your facts have you gotten a smoking gun here i might have asked him that but i never tried to stop it or anything else " mr murdochs first big foray into china was his purchase in of a controlling stake in the south china morning post a hong kong daily hong kong was then still a british colony but its political and business fortunes were increasingly intertwined with the policies of the chinese communist party the paper opened a bureau in beijing the two young american reporters who staffed it seth faison and marlowe hood say they were given free rein to write what they wanted phillip crawley then editor says he received "not a word from murdoch" about how to cover the june tiananmen square massacre or chinese affairs in general in the late s the papers managing director clarence chang visited beijing to discuss a business deal with an arm of chinas state media apparatus he also met with messrs faison and hood and complained about a column the bureau had written that poked fun at a spring festival shown on china central television according to mr faison he says mr chang urged them to write more upbeat articles about china and to refrain from offending chinas state media establishment "its good for me its good for you and its good for rupert " mr faison says mr chang told them mr faison now a media consultant in los angeles says they ignored the appeal and continued to write about china as they pleased mr chang says he doesnt recall the incident but says he never pressured the news staff to tone down what they wrote about china mr murdoch says that if the incident occurred it was "good" the reporters ignored the request in mr murdoch sold the south china morning post or scmp at a profit he said at a news conference at the time that he wanted to avoid conflict with beijing and the risk of having star tv "shut down because of the opinions of some our editors " david armstrong the papers then editor says mr murdoch told him "that if he was going to do business in china he would really have to sit on the scmp and he didnt want to do that " mr murdochs plans for star tv which some users got access to by using satellite dishes didnt go smoothly in china in a speech mr murdoch described satellite tv technology as "an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere " a few months later china restricted the use of satellite dishes to limited areas although a thriving illicit market for them has developed on friday mr murdoch said that his relations with the chinese government became a source of frustration "i had not been received by a single minister or anyone " he recalled "we just had a total blackout for five years " he said he believed that the government might have been told that he was a british spy star tv carried the british broadcasting corp s international news channel whose station identifier featured pictures of a chinese man blocking a tank near tiananmen square the bbc had infuriated beijing with its coverage of the student protests and with a documentary "chairman mao the last emperor " which alleged that the late chinese dictator had an appetite for young girls in spring star tv dumped the bbc gary davey then head of star tv in hong kong says news corp s relations with the bbc had been souring for some time he says he told mr murdoch that he wanted to launch a chinese language movie channel but didnt have extra space on the satellite mr murdoch he says "was emphatic" in his support of the decision to yank the bbc in a interview with journalist william shawcross mr murdoch said "they say its a cowardly way but we said that in order to get in there and get accepted well cut the bbc out " mr murdoch now says the decision to cut the bbc was "primarily a financial consideration but it might have occurred to me this might not hurt relations with beijing " in early with mr murdochs beijing relations still testy news corp s harpercollins publishing house decided to cancel a book by chris patten britains last governor of hong kong whom chinese leaders loathed harpercollins initially said it dumped the book because it was boring but then an internal memo from a harpercollins official surfaced citing mr murdochs concern about "negative aspects of publication " after mr patten sued the publishing house "unreservedly apologized" and admitted the allegations that the book was boring were "untrue " mr patten later found another publisher mr murdoch says he didnt want to publish the book in part because he thought mr patten "was a terrible governor " and added "no one in china ever spoke to me about it i was never put under any pressure " mr patten credits the furor with boosting the books sales "god bless you mr murdoch " he joked recently in an email bruce dover news corps beijing based executive says there was also friction with chinese officials over articles in the times the officials complained repeatedly about the work of hong kong based jonathan mirsky an american born veteran china watcher and often fierce critic of the communist party mr dover says he raised the issue with mr murdoch and was told that muzzling mr mirsky wasnt an option critics would be "all over me " mr dover says mr murdoch told him mr mirsky continued reporting for the times from hong kong until after the colonys handover he later complained publicly that his stories were routinely spiked by the paper and that mr murdochs interests in china had compromised coverage peter stothard then editor of the times says that wasnt true he says interest in hong kongs transition to chinese rule waned in all british media after the handover from britain to china coverage of the former colony did drop off in other london papers the timess independent directors reviewed mr mirskys complaints and found them without merit although they didnt talk to mr mirsky mark shuldham schreiber one of the directors says board members asked mr stothard if he had received any "outside pressure" to quash mr mirskys stories when he said no there was no reason to pursue it any further mr schreiber say newspapers now account for only about of news corp s total operating income or &# million in the nine months to march according to the companys financial statements much of the money is made by big selling tabloids such as londons sun while some of its best known titles such as the new york post and times of london are consistent money losers the times competing in a crowded market lost &# million in according to a person familiar with its accounts the new york post which until recently trailed competitors such as the new york daily news in circulation has long been estimated to lose tens of millions of dollars even the australian which turned a profit in for the first time doesnt consistently make money according to one news corp executive the circulation of the national daily lags that of several of the major metropolitan dailies in australia nowadays mr murdoch has much to occupy his attention beyond newspapers aside from monitoring news corp s film and television operations in the u s and satellite tv interests overseas he also is contending with the upheaval caused by the internet news corp has a thriving presence on the web through its ownership of myspace in the fall he plans to launch a new business news tv channel and has said he hopes the wall street journal could help it if hes successful in his bid for the journal he insists that he plans no changes on the news side and will mostly focus on boosting its advertising and circulation and its web site he says he will maintain "an absolute wall" between the papers business side and its newsroom even when the paper is reporting on news corp "i just ask you to spell my name right " he says geoffrey a fowler in hong kong contributed to this article
