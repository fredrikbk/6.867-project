why pigging out is leaving chinese consumers out of pork beijing as pork prices skyrocket some of chinas farmers are living high on the hog but for many smaller producers consumers and the countrys political leaders its yet another damaging swing in the countrys agricultural markets the latest sudden sharp surge in the price of chinas staple meat as of mid may wholesale pork prices are up compared to the same time last year has turned into a national political event premier wen jiabao has toured markets and reassured anxious citizens that the situation is under control the minister of transportation jumped in promising to help ensure pork makes it smoothly from slaughterhouse to market the government may even open up its strategic pork reserve a supply of frozen pork and live pigs it can use to help stabilize prices the surge in the price of pork throws a spotlight on the boom and bust cycle that bedevils chinas hundreds of millions of farmers and increasing calls for more information and better communication to help alleviate the problem for many chinese meat means pork at nearly ounces each day the average person here eats more pork than in any other nation except germany according to the united nations food and agriculture organization poland and austria are close rivals feeding its population of billion china is by far the worlds biggest producer of the meat nearly million tons of pork came from its slaughterhouses last year while china imports pork as well the volume is small in comparison to its total output chinas consumption of pork and other meats has risen in recent years as ever richer urbanites enjoy a more luxurious diet but that hasnt always translated into big profits for the farmers who actually own the countrys million or so pigs "its just like the stock market " says guo qiurong at her farm outside beijing which houses its pigs in long low slung concrete buildings "if you can take the risk you get in if you cant you get out once they start losing money farmers just stop raising pigs " chinas pork prices generally tend to rise and fall in major cycles of three to four years the last big surge came in that this years price spike comes during the chinese zodiacs year of the pig appears to be a coincidence the pattern is now well enough established that farmers should in theory be able to smooth out the fluctuations the main problem bad information and poor planning that leads too many farmers to pull out of the market or jump in at the wrong time bigger farms often have an advantage in riding out market cycles ms guos farm for instance produces about pigs ready for slaughter each year unlike the many individual households that may raise only to pigs her farm wont sell off all its stock if prices drop since the last boom pork prices had fallen for two years prices for pig feed rose at the same time leading many farmers to trim the size of their herds or abandon pig raising entirely now that prices are up again they are caught without enough pigs to sell typical of chinas volatile pork market this years shortage has been exacerbated by a pig disease known as blue ear formally called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome an outbreak appeared in several of chinas southern provinces in the middle of last year and new cases in guangdong province were also detected in april according to information china submitted to the world organization for animal health the government says the disease has sickened pigs and killed this year though it hasnt revealed loss estimates from last years larger outbreak high pork prices are hitting chinese consumers pocketbooks at a bad time inflation is now around mostly because of a recent rise in food prices at the same time the higher prices are already encouraging pig farmers to increase the size of their herds to take advantage of them the government is also promising subsidies to farmers who produce more all that is setting up the next step in the cycle "next year there will be oversupply and the price will fall " says wu laping a professor at china agricultural university "farmers are totally rational its just very difficult for them to get the kind of information they need to make scientific decisions " says mr wu who would like chinas agriculture ministry to be more like the u s department of agriculture and distribute extensive information about weather production and prices to help farmers plan ahead now some farmers complain that price information from the government is spotty and inaccurate so they often rely on tips picked up at the feed store to judge the direction of the market in a speech last week minister of agriculture sun zhengcai said the government will "strengthen information release and early warning analysis in order to guide farmers to a correct understanding of market trends " the ministry declined to elaborate on that statement though there are initiatives underway to for instance expand internet access in rural areas even the larger scale farms that have an advantage in planning face big risks ms guos farm had plenty of pigs available to sell when this years boom arrived and wasnt forced to buy sows at the current high prices in order to rear more piglets for next year but that doesnt mean ms guo and her crew are complacent blue ear disease has so far spared them but they live in fear of an outbreak of any number of infections that could wipe out their stock and force them to start again from scratch "once youve scaled up the risk is actually bigger " says zhang dongliang who oversees the farms obsessive sanitation measures zhou yang contributed to this article
