no pyrrhic victory on the morning of june a fleet of low flying israeli jets surprised the egyptian air force on the ground and destroyed it this act of military pre emption helped save israel from what iraqs then president abdul rahman aref had called only several days earlier "our opportunity to wipe israel off the map " yet years later israels victory is widely seen as a pyrrhic one "a calamity for the jewish state no less than for its neighbors " according to a recent editorial in the economist and the alternative was the six day war is supposed to be the great pivot on which the modern history of the middle east hinges the moment the palestinian question came into focus and israel went from being the david to the goliath of the conflict its a reading of history that has the convenience of offering a political prescription rewind to the status quo ante june arrange a peace deal and the problems that have arisen since more or less go away or so the thinking goes yet the striking fact is that all of israels peace agreements with egypt in with the palestinians in with jordan and morocco in were achieved in the wake of the war the jewish state had gained territory the arab states wanted it back whatever else might be said for the land for peace formula its odd that the people who are its strongest advocates are usually the same ones who bemoan the apparent completeness of israels victory in great events have a way not only of reshaping the outlook for the future but also our understanding of the past usually in the service of clarity "why england slept" was an apt question to ask of britain in the mid s but it made sense only after sept by contrast the six day war laid a thick fog over what came before today the pre period is remembered not least by many israelis as a time when the countrys conscience was clear and respectable world opinion admired "plucky little israel " yet these were the same years when israel lived within what abba eban its dovish foreign minister called "auschwitz borders " with only nine miles separating the westernmost part of the west bank from the mediterranean sea it is also often said today that the six day war humiliated the arabs and propelled the region into future rounds of fighting yet president aref of iraq had prefaced his call to destroy israel by describing the war as the arabs chance "to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since " it is said that the war inaugurated the era of modern terrorism as the arab world switched from a strategy of conventional confrontation with israel to one of "unconventional" attacks yet hundreds of israelis had already been killed in fedayeen raids in israels first years of existence it is said that the palestinian movement was born from israels occupation of gaza and the west bank yet the palestine liberation organization was already in its third year of operations when the war began it is said that israel enjoyed international legitimacy so long as it lived behind recognized frontiers yet those frontiers were no less provisional before than they were after only after the six day war did the green line come to be seen as the "real" border fog also surrounds memories of the immediate aftermath of the war to read some recent accounts a more sagacious israel could have followed up its historic victory with peace overtures that would have spared everyone the bloody entanglements of its occupation of the sinai gaza the west bank and the golan heights or failing that it could have resisted the lure of building settlements in the territories in order not to complicate a land for peace transaction in fact the israeli cabinet agreed on june to offer the sinai to egypt and the golan to syria in exchange for peace deals in khartoum that september the arab league declared "no peace with israel no recognition of israel no negotiations with it " as for jewish settlements hardly any were built for years after the war in for instance only about settlers had moved to the west bank its true that the war caused israel to lose friends abroad "le peuple juif sur de lui meme et dominateur" "the jewish people sure of themselves and domineering" was charles de gaulles memorable line in announcing in november that france would no longer supply israel militarily such were the jewish states former friends on the other hand israel gained new friends the u s whose declared policy during the war was to be "neutral in thought word and deed " would never again pretend such indifference something that made all the difference to israel in the yom kippur war tens of thousands of american and european jews immigrated to israel after sensing it was a country not on the brink of extinction christian evangelicals also became israels firm friends expanding the political base of american support beyond its traditionally narrow jewish democratic core none of this is to say that the six day war was an unalloyed or unironic blessing for israel by gaining control of the west bank and the gaza strip israel swapped its old territorial insecurities for new demographic ones as palestinian numbers grew israels efforts to find a new strategic equilibrium first through negotiations with the plo later through unilateral withdrawals became increasingly frenetic who knows whether they will succeed then again when the sun rose on june israel was a poor desperately vulnerable country which threw the dice on its own survival in the most audacious military strike of the th century it is infinitely richer and more powerful today sure in its alliance with the u s and capable of making concessions inconceivable years ago if these are the fruits of israels "pyrrhic victory " it needs more such of them see related letters "letters to the editor forty years after six day war obdurate hatred of israel persists" wsj june
