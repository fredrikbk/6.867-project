will he get a tony birthday gift london bob crowley turns on june which this year just happens to be the date of the tony awards an auspicious coincidence the birthday boy has shots at prizes in best scenic design of a play "the coast of utopia " in collaboration with scott pask best scenic design of a musical "mary poppins" and best costume design for a musical also "mary poppins" no nomination for his cyclorama and skewed shanty for "moon for the misbegotten " which though no one seems to have noticed wittily quotes andrew wyeths iconic "christinas world " none either for his work on joan didions one woman play "the year of magical thinking " which mr crowley at first didnt think needed scenic design at all four broadway openings in one season mr crowley is on quite a roll in the spring before "utopia" ended its limited engagement all of his new shows were running simultaneously along with "tarzan " which opened last season mr crowley not only designed that one but directed it too his first outing in that capacity the critics did not like it but to judge by the squeals at a recent packed matinee family audiences are going home very happy when david hare who was to direct "magical thinking " talked him into signing on mr crowley delivered his scenic sketches in the form of dozens of abstract watercolors in shades from off white to brown and black all based on views of water or of the sky seen from an airplane five were transferred to huge cloths of china silk and hung one behind another as a suite of proscenium filling kabuki drops kabuki drops "fabric that falls is called a kabuki drop " mr crowley said recently at his home in london it is a bright neatly appointed dwelling carved out of the basement and part of the first floor of an th century row house in bloomsbury wherever you look intriguing trinkets and objets await discovery "the japanese have been using kabuki drops for centuries " nothing in the theatrical arsenal feels more momentous than the sudden vanishing of the background with a whoosh and a flutter in "magical thinking " the shock registers with incremental force each time "i felt the drops would express something about grief depression going mad and david had the idea of having the space open up more and more so that the joan didion character would be more and more isolated " to complete the effect mr crowley raised the stage floor six inches and provided covered slots in the floor that opened just long enough to receive a cloth as it fell "i didnt want them to be seen to be pulled away " the perfectionist explains that minimalist economical scenic solution was arguably the most elegant of the broadway season but if the nominating committee for the tonys was unimpressed mr crowley is not complaining three nominations in as many categories in a single year that puts mr crowley in the company of bob fosse and tommy tune a very exclusive club indeed his cumulative total of tony nominations now stands at two for his american debut in the all white sets and costumes of "les liaisons dangereuses " the third and his first win in scenic design was for his next american job "carousel " "aida " in and "the history boys " in fetched him two more tonys again for scenic design since design for plays and design for musicals have been separate categories and mr crowley is grateful "competing against yourself " he says "thats the worst " his story begins in county cork ireland "my father put out fires for a living " mr crowley says "i was a nerdy artistic kid who could paint and draw i never set out to be a set designer i loved the theater i wanted to be an actor " though there was no professional theater in cork community theater was flourishing and a lot of time young bob crowley ought to have been spending on schoolwork went instead to painting scenery when he was a teacher asked him to do some designing "thats when i caught a bit of a bug " mr crowley says a week of theatergoing in london when he was and his condition became incurable stage design was what he had to do and the royal shakespeare company and the national theatre were where he wanted to do it a set model for an unproduced "macbeth" "sculptural henry moore ish monumental dark" won mr crowley a scholarship in bristol which isnt quite london but was getting him closer then for several years he bounced around first a stint in horrible leicester then happy times as low man on the totem pole at the national then a reluctant return to bristol where he was offered some real design responsibilities along the way he befriended other kindred souls cameron mackintosh helen mirren daniel day lewis among them headed for starry futures another early pal was the director adrian noble a pair of unknowns mr noble and mr crowley embarked on a year partnership that swept them right to the promised land of the rsc their golden age there culminated with the trilogy "the plantagenets " adapted from shakespeares four earliest history plays by then though mr crowley had had enough "no more shakespeare " he told himself new plays were what he wanted now which brings us to "les liaisons dangereuses " originally presented at stratford upon avon "in a world war ii nissan hut" formally known as "the other place " "we wanted it to have a louche decadent air we did it with bare boards shutters a big highboy with clothes falling from open drawers all very monochromatic " mr crowley has never designed costumes for a show without designing the scenery too but they are not a secondary interest "you are what you wear " mr crowley says though hes interested in period detail his top priority is dramatic truth "say im doing something elizabethan " he continues "ill talk to the actor and say tell me about your character if he talks about vanity or meanness or anger those are characterful things something sharp in the costumes can reflect them if he gives me a contemporary reference i might incorporate that with a silhouette thats in period made of fabric thats contemporary id never force an actor into a period costume that didnt enhance what hes trying to project if i have to ill change the period im not a pedant period accuracy is just an exercise if thats what you care about work in a museum " not a pedant and not an engineer for the amazing chinese box that is the set of "mary poppins " mr crowley built working models to show every set change "theres an entire edwardian house onstage and thats just the beginning " he says "we cant have mary poppins sing a song feet in the air so the nursery had to descend i work everything out in the model then i go to the engineer and say i want the nursery to fly and i dont want to see how its done " in "mary poppins " everything worked like a charm "tarzan" has yet to find its platonic form "that show was never meant to be in a proscenium house " says mr crowley strolling to his studio several blocks away "it was meant to be done in the round it was meant to be wilder deeper all in one space with no overhang bigger more epic more fun " design models in his studio conjure up the all enveloping spectacles of cirque du soleil on broadway today the only really memorable image in "tarzan" is the one the audience sees on entering the theater before the action begins with a thunderclap and a blackout "its painted on silk and hung on a rod that moves and gives it motion a painted ship upon a painted ocean " mr crowley is reciting from coleridges "rime of the ancient mariner " "christinas world" in "moon for the misbegotten " coleridge in "tarzan" even at its most populist his creations have layers of allusion "we live in a world now where a warhol is worth more than a rembrandt " he remarks commenting on the latest auction news you know he doesnt approve of cultural amnesia next up is verdis "don carlos " an opera of somber majesty for the royal opera london in co production with the metropolitan opera and den norske opera oslo "i think don carlos needs intense metaphorical weight " mr crowley says "its obsessed with death " the shelves of his studio are overflowing with fiction and art books and mislabeled storage boxes full of miniature handmade props for past projects but not a scrap yet that relates to the new one to steep themselves in the ambience mr crowley and the director nicholas hytner will shortly be heading for spain to visit the funereal escorial and other locations that verdis th century characters inhabit and given carte blanche what would be the project after that "west side story " mr crowley answers in a heartbeat "no one has looked at that one properly for years " mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
