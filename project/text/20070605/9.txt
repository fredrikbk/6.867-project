broadcasters win profanity ruling appeals court panel says unscripted expletives dont violate standards washington broadcasters scored a major victory as an appeals court ruled that inadvertently airing profanity didnt violate decency standards the decision was a strong rebuke of the federal communications commission which had tried to institute a no tolerance policy on the airing of virtually all expletives even unscripted profanities during live television and radio broadcasts and it is a big win for the four major tv networks and their affiliate stations which faced the threat of multimillion dollar indecency fines if the fccs policy had been upheld the networks challenged the fccs profanity rules which said expletives were almost never appropriate for broadcast and in a to decision a panel of the u s court of appeals for the second circuit in new york sided with the networks it said the fcc had failed to "articulate a reasoned basis for its change in policy" and sent the matter back to the agency for further review "this makes it very difficult for us to enforce our indecency regime " fcc chairman kevin martin said in an interview he suggested the agency may either appeal the decision to the full appeals court or directly to the supreme court no decision has been made he said however he suggested the fcc might not be inclined to try again to justify its rationale for the rule because the court "already said theyre doubtful we could provide one " "i disagree with the decision and im disappointed for parents across the country " he added fox broadcasting corp a news corp unit said it was "very pleased" with the courts decision "viewers should be allowed to determine for themselves and their families through the many parental control technologies available what is appropriate viewing for their home " fox said in a statement broadcasting profanities has been forbidden for more than years since the supreme court ruled that comedian george carlins monologue "filthy words" actually did contain seven words that the court said shouldnt air when children could be listening but the fcc mostly turned a deaf ear to unscripted profanities that slipped onto the air over the years particularly during live broadcasts that changed abruptly in when nbc broadcast u singer bono using an expletive to express delight at winning a golden globe award the fcc didnt fine nbc a general electric co unit for the incident which the network is still challenging but said the singer had violated federal indecency standards the fcc has used the incident as the precedent for fines ever since in march the fcc said several broadcast television stations had violated federal indecency rules when airing expletives even unwittingly in particular the fcc found fox television had violated profanity restrictions while airing the "billboard music awards" in when singer cher used an unscripted expletive and when socialite nicole richie jokingly complained about how hard it was to get cow manure out of a prada purse unusually unified the networks and affiliates appealed the fccs decision a month later arguing the agency hadnt adequately explained why it had decided to change its decades old policy or when it might be appropriate to air profanities the fcc had problems with bono using an expletive during a live awards show they pointed out but had no issues with the same word being used multiple times when the war movie "saving private ryan" was aired after the bono incident network executives privately expressed concerns that a court challenge was their only option because fcc chairman martin a social conservative had stepped up indecency enforcement potentially resulting in many multimillion dollar fines another problem congress had increased indecency fines tenfold in june to a maximum of &# per violation which gave mr martins fcc more ability to assess big dollar fines the court didnt take a position on the constitutional issues raised by the networks however it said "we are skeptical that the fcc can provide a reasoned explanation for its fleeting expletive regime that would pass constitutional muster " judge pierre leval wrote in dissent that the fcc should be deferred to in deciding indecency fines but said that "in explanation of this relatively modest change of standard the commission gave a sensible although not necessarily compelling reason " the fcc will now have to reassess its efforts to enforce indecency standards even as it tries to handle the hundreds of indecency complaints that have piled up over the past two years
