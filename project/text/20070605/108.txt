will vodafone be put in play by abn energized activists londons macho hedge fund community has been congratulating itself for playing a major role in forcing dutch banking titan abn amro holding nv to put itself up for sale now some observers are whispering about whether vodafone group plc could be the next target vodafone like abn amro may be worth more in parts than it is whole making it a prime candidate for investors agitating for a breakup the newbury england company has been harangued by shareholders recently and has several large holdings that look tempting to other buyers making vodafone attractive to activist type investors among the most valuable pieces its stake in u s cellphone carrier verizon wireless the rest of the nations largest cellular firm by revenue is owned by verizon communications inc the biggest obstacle to pushing for change at the company is its sheer size vodafones shares have risen about since their recent low in march giving the company a market value of about &# billion in london trading yesterday vodafone fell to pence in p m composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange vodafones american depositary shares were up cents to &# the climb has been a result of better than expected earnings along with a general rise in the long shunned telecommunications sector the british mobile phone operators net loss narrowed to gbp billion &# billion in the year ended march from a loss of gbp billion in the previous year vodafones shares also have enjoyed a bounce in recent weeks amid speculation that at&amp t inc could be considering a bid for the company a move that would likely mean at least some breakup of vodafone particularly a sale of its stake in verizon wireless at&amp t has said it may pursue smaller strategic acquisitions abroad but a person familiar with its thinking says the company isnt likely to make a major move so soon after its purchase of bellsouth corp at the end of last year some analysts think vodafone could have a higher valuation if sold or split up vodafones shares currently trade at about six times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year ended march but recent sales of some telecom companies such as alltel corp s agreement to be taken over by private equity firms have fetched as much as nine times investors "are treating vodafone like its just europe " says dresdner kleinwort wasserstein analyst robert grindle mr grindle has a "buy" rating on the stock and doesnt own vodafone shares dresdner or an affiliate owns vodafone stock but doesnt have an investment banking relationship with the company many companies are finding themselves in the cross hairs of investors seeking change including candy and beverage maker cadbury schweppes plc shareholders also have pondered whether citigroup inc and general electric co might be valued more in parts than they are whole so far nobody publicly has made a move to target vodafone and it isnt certain that any hedge fund or other investors will do so partly because of the complexity involved with a breakup and because of vodafones size an activist would require a huge investment to push for change investment bankers also say that breaking up vodafone could trigger a huge tax bill that would eat up much of the potential gains still following the hedge fund worlds success in forcing abn amro to put itself on the block resulting in a nearly &# billion bidding war there remains a chance that a hedge fund or group of funds will go after vodafone particularly if the shares stumble again "the burden of proof is on vodafone to demonstrate that its strategy of owning all these assets makes sense " says philippe kiewit de jonge a fund manager at abn amro asset management mr kiewit de jonge is a vodafone shareholder but declined to detail the size of his position some vodafone shareholders prefer its steady cash flow from mature markets such as western europe others favor vodafones clutch of businesses in emerging markets where millions of people dont use any mobile service yet breaking vodafone into two companies could appease these two groups because shareholders would have more focused companies to invest in vodafone chief executive arun sarin says there are benefits to keeping the european and emerging market operations under one umbrella such as economies of scale in purchasing equipment and marketing "i personally dont believe that there is big reason for a breakup " he said during a recent meeting with the media vodafones core western european operations account for more than three quarters the companys total sales for the year ended march revenue from these operations slipped to gbp billion from gbp billion a year earlier those figures reflect vodafones sale of businesses in belgium and switzerland among others vodafones revenue in emerging markets such as south africa and egypt grew to gbp billion including acquisitions and vodafone recently purchased a controlling stake in a large indian operator vodafone also has minority stakes it could sell to the majority owners including verizon and a roughly stake in vivendi sas mobile unit sfr in france money from those sales could be returned to shareholders terence sinclair an analyst at citigroup says a breakup of vodafone could add as much as gbp billion in value or about pence a share he estimates the european businesses are valued at gbp billion and emerging markets units at about gbp billion excluding smaller vodafone stakes such as china mobile ltd dionne searcey contributed to this article
