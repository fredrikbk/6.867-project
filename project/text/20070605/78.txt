politics &amp economics chinas carbon stance may stymie deal beijing chinas plan for addressing climate change reiterates its existing energy efficiency targets and fails to include caps on emissions a stance that reduces the chances of a breakthrough in climate change talks this week in what it called its first national climate change plan china said it recognizes the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and pledged to integrate efforts to mitigate such emissions into an overall plan for sustainable economic development but officials rejected calls for specific targets for reducing emissions "to ask the developing countries to lower emissions too early too abruptly and too bluntly will hinder their development and hamper efforts to achieve industrialization and modernization " said ma kai chinas top economic planning official global warming will be a central topic at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight leading nations beginning tomorrow in germany which chinas president hu jintao is to attend some experts expect china to surpass the u s this year as the worlds top emitter of greenhouse gases and beijing is under pressure to commit to reduce its production of such gases last week the u s removed a major obstacle for an international agreement when president bush reversed longstanding policy and called on economic powers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions german chancellor angela merkel is pushing for a deal on climate change at the g meeting but chinas refusal to accept any targets on its carbon emissions could stymie that goal china prefers that a deal like the kyoto protocol be arranged through the united nations said mr ma who is chairman of the national development and reform commission beijing is a signatory to that agreement which excludes china and other developing countries from emissions caps chinese scientists have argued that the country is particularly vulnerable to climate change because it has scarce land and water resources and many of its major economic centers sit in low lying coastal areas chinas government says rich industrialized nations have contributed the bulk of greenhouse gases historically and should bear the brunt of the cleanup costs it says caps on developing countries are unfair while china is struggling with an unprecedented wave of industrialization and urbanization that has improved conditions for many of its people millions of peasants remain poor and chinese officials say alleviating poverty takes priority over climate change while refusing to accept limits on greenhouse gases mr ma said china will reduce such gases through its drive to increase energy efficiency about two thirds of chinas greenhouse gases come from burning fossil fuels such as coal or oil for energy the government reiterated the target that it set a year ago of reducing energy consumption per unit of economic output by between and mr ma said reaching that goal would mean releasing less carbon dioxide a prominent greenhouse gas but so far china has had only limited success in reaching its energy efficiency targets and the pace of its economic growth could continue to make that difficult last year for example china failed to meet its first year target of cutting energy consumption relative to economic output by managing instead to reduce it by only that reduction did reverse the trend of deterioration in chinas energy efficiency
