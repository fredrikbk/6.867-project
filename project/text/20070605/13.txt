business technology talking tech motion sensors find lots of applications cars with air bags the new wii videogame player and the soon to be launched iphone from apple all have a technology in common motion sensors these are tiny chips that can detect whether a device is moving or not and if so in which direction not surprisingly the companies that make motion sensors have lots of ideas about other products in which they would be useful harvey weinberg applications engineer at analog devices inc talked about some of the lesser known current uses of motion sensors and about some new products that might soon be around the corner q so these sensors arent just for games a i would be surprised if you could go through the day and not interact with a sensor they are used in laptop computers ibm uses them to tell if youve dropped your laptop so it can park the head of the hard disk drive before the drive head crashes into the recordable medium there are also a lot of applications in health care devices in cardiac rhythm management for instance you might want to pace the heart differently if someone is sitting up or lying down or if they are running up stairs or walking down some stairs q what other products could take advantage of sensors a think of all the things that need to know what their inclination is even something as simple as an iron everyone has an iron in their home when its right side up you want the temperature to go down but when its down you want the temperature to go higher but if its face down and you havent moved it for a bit of time you better turn the iron off before it burns through a hole in your clothing cordless drills are getting so powerful that if they catch you could really hurt yourself so now they put sensors in drills to determine if the body of the drill has started to turn instead of the bit if the bit has stopped the torque is cut off q how about real sports as opposed to sports in videogames a the quality of your game in golf or tennis is directly proportional to how well you can swing the club or racket right now its pretty difficult to analyze a swing because it happens very quickly but you can put inertial sensors into golf clubs or tennis rackets and then record all of the information from your swing and download the data to your pc and then the golf pro standing next to you could look at your virtual swing on his computer and he would be able to say "aha the reason that the ball sliced is that you rotated your hands " q would the sensors be fast enough for that a tvs and movies work because theyre flashing images at us at or frames a second but one th of a second is an infinity for an electronic device people move very slowly in relation to what electronics can measure q how big would a motion sensor for a tennis racket or gold club be a the weight is really not significant youre talking about only or grams its the volume thats probably difficult though you might be able to put it in the grip of the golf club or someplace like that the battery technology thats really the hardest part of it you have to get a battery in there somewhere q so how do these motion sensors work exactly a they are actually pretty simple we have a mass think of it as a hunk of metal like an anvil that weighs something and its suspended by a couple of springs so if i yank this assembly it will displace the mass from its initial position proportionately to the strength of the springs that are holding it thats exactly how these sensors work but instead of a big hunk of iron we use a tiny piece of polysilicon that weighs half a microgram and then we measure the displacement of the mass and that tells us how much acceleration a device has been subject to q it sounds simple a a first year college kid would have all of the physics necessary to fully explain how this thing works
