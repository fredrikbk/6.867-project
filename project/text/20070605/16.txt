business technology now computing can handle long distance relationships teradicis blade technology provides efficient connections from far flung data centers high tech executives have long talked about replacing personal computers on corporate desks with something simpler but relatively few customers have done it a vancouver british columbia chip maker hopes to change that the closely held startup teradici corp has developed technology to make it more practical to manage users computing experiences from a data center reducing energy consumption as well operating costs associated with visiting users desks to make repairs and install software instead of a pc each employees keyboard and monitor plug into a small gadget that sends signals on a wire to a server called a pc blade which runs software ordinarily handled by a desktop machine that isnt a new feat what is hard is to separate the desktop and the server by hundreds or thousands of miles while providing the responsiveness and the sophisticated graphics and sound of a full featured pc dan cordingley a former intel corp executive who is teradicis chief executive says his companys goal is to make it impossible for long distance users to recognize the difference between using a pc blade and using a desktop pc some customers that plan to use the technology say it has succeeded "i cant believe what it can do " says joe makoid president of devon it inc a company that worked with international business machines corp to develop a recently announced pc blade offering bruce cohen chief executive of clearcube technology inc an austin texas company that pioneered pc blades says "i think its going to blow people away " simple terminals and centralized mainframe systems were the way computer power was originally delivered that was supplanted by pcs which offered processing power and inspired many useful programs some high profile ceos like larry ellison of oracle corp later advocated a return to inexpensive "network computers" or "thin clients" to reduce hardware and operating costs they remain a distinct minority one reason is that pc prices fell sharply another is performance while microsoft corp citrix systems inc and others offer software to run pc programs on terminals connected to standard servers users who need pc quality graphics and sound often arent satisfied then came pc blades which are essentially the main circuit boards of desktop computers flipped on their sides and stacked vertically makers include clearcube and hewlett packard co some of the biggest users of pc blades are traders at financial services firms who want several monitors and the processing power of multiple computers but dont want noisy fans or technicians visiting in the event of breakdowns until recently users could be no more than meters from blades teradicis trick is to compress and convert display data along with so called usb signals used by pc accessories into the digital format found on corporate networks and the internet the approach which teradici calls pc over ip is incorporated into chips for pc blades and desktop connectors called portals ibm and devon it of king of prussia pa estimate a portal will draw watts of power compared with as much as watts for a desktop system they estimate that pc blades could be located as far as miles from desktops beyond that distance users might encounter delays as signals pass around the internet portals need no microprocessor chips no memory no hard drives or cd roms the device mainly has sockets for connecting displays keyboards printers and other usb devices likely customers include hospitals intelligence agencies and any organization concerned about data security teradicis technology sets different access privileges some portals users for example may be allowed to plug in usb "thumb drives" to remove data but others may not mr cordingley says "it has a bunch of security features that are unachievable with desktop computers " says tom bradicich a vice president in ibms systems and technology group ibm clearcube and others are expected to sell products based on the technology in the third quarter pricing has not been set although mr cordingley estimates portals should cost the same as or less than todays thin clients which start around &# teradici a employee company that has raised &# million in venture capital expects the technology to find applications beyond business companies could offer portals for the home mr cordingley says
