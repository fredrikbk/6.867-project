lerach retires the law firm of trial bar titan bill lerach announced last week that its infamous leader was considering "retirement " whatever the legal outcome of the federal probe into milberg weiss it seems the case is already serving up some de facto tort reform milberg weiss and two of its top lawyers were indicted more than a year ago for paying kickbacks to their lead plaintiffs mr lerach who left milberg in to start his own firm has so far avoided charges but the news that milberg partner david bershad is in talks to cop a plea and turn states evidence means more indictments are possible its also possible that mr lerachs new firm lerach coughlin wants him out ahead of the sheriff put another way this case is already making a public example of bad tort behavior even as federal prosecutors have marched white collar felons from enron worldcom and adelphia to prison theyve been largely unwilling to pursue corruption in the big business of lawsuit abuse this is partly because cases against trial lawyers are tricky the tort bar is adept at skirting the edges of the law as well as hiding behind legal protections such as attorney client privilege yet as the milberg case is demonstrating the prosecution is worth the effort consider the judiciary as the sordid details of milberg have leaked judges have been taking a closer look at the cases the trial bar is presenting courts have been choosier about whom they appoint as lead counsel in class actions last year a federal judge in detroit denied milberg lead counsel status in a suit against ford in march a federal judge in boston similarly refused to give the firm sole lead status noting that he questioned milbergs "ability to adequately present truthful factual information to the court " landing the lucrative "lead counsel" assignment in which a law firm is allowed to represent thousands of unnamed plaintiffs is what drives many firms to manufacture class actions in the first place and much to the tort bars horror some judges are now refusing even to certify class actions in december the second circuit court of appeals ruled that a suit brought by milberg and other firms against wall street firms could not proceed as a class all this new judicial scrutiny may help explain why securities class actions dropped by in more broadly judges are taking a look at what plaintiffs attorneys are paid and in the process cutting the profit motive behind many suits in december an illinois state judge sliced the attorneys fees for milberg and other firms in half calling them "excessive and unrealistic " in january a federal judge in new york awarded milberg little more than one third of the &# million it sought for winning a shareholder settlement from nortel networks one federal judge last year even ordered milberg to pay its opponents legal fees plaintiffs too are exercising more due diligence in the past year new york states retirement fund and ohios public college savings fund both dropped milberg as a lead counsel in class action litigation while private companies have also given it the boot the message to other law firms get a reputation for playing fast and loose and risk losing the biggest clients none of this is to say the milberg prosecution has been perfect justice would have accomplished as much by indicting only those partners and cronies it believed had committed crimes rather than the whole firm as with arthur andersen the innocent may now suffer as much as the guilty if the milberg firm implodes the u s also still needs legislative tort reform the private securities litigation reform act was a step in the right direction but it has failed to stop the worst abuses and opened the door to new alliances between the tort bar and ambitious politicians who run state pension funds the entire system needs revamping starting with the conflicted position of public pension funds and ending with the duplicative role the sec plays alongside the legal system still the justice department has succeeded in exposing some of the nastier corruption in the big business of class actions and in the process is sending a deterrent message to other trial lawyers if it wants to reinforce that message justice could turn next to the equally corrupt world of asbestos and silicosis litigation sending a few rotten trial lawyers to jail wont fix the legal system by itself but it cant hurt
