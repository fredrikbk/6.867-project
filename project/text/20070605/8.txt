boss talk how genentech wins at blockbuster drugs ceo to critics of prices give me a break the founding of genentech inc in launched the biotechnology industry which engineers drugs from living cells instead of test tubes headquartered in south san francisco calif genentech just finished its best year ever with a surge in profit to &# billion driven by avastin for colon and lung cancer rituxan for non hodgkins lymphoma herceptin for breast cancer and lucentis for blindness more than studies presented at the american society of clinical oncology this week will involve the use of the companys drugs against more than tumor types a spokeswoman said genentechs philosophy is to create medicines to fill unmet needs and to recoup its big research and development investment &# billion in by charging premium prices a years supply of avastin for example costs &# but the company is feeling mounting pressure from congress and medicare to curb prices and from competitors seeking to produce rival generic products chief executive officer arthur d levinson who has a doctorate in biochemistry joined genentech as a senior scientist in and did pioneering work on the cancer gene her neu that led to the blockbuster herceptin he recently spoke with wall street journal editors about the challenges facing his company and the health care industry excerpts wsj you have multiple blockbuster biotech drugs on the market and more on the way in such an uncertain business how do you manage scientists to achieve that kind of success dr levinson we are first and foremost committed to doing great science if a drug cant be the first in class or the best in class were just not interested were not looking to achieve incremental advances or extend patents or do x y z unless it is going to really matter for patients that allows us to bring in phenomenal scientists and encourage them to do the basic and translational research we decided years ago that we would be committing to oncology which at the time for us was new we are now the leading producer of anticancer drugs in the united states we took a lot of risks in many cases those risks paid off we are now also in immunology again the role of management here is to set the broad direction and then hire absolutely the best scientists and bring them in and say do your stuff there are always trade offs in the short term between the cancer patient or the immunology patient you cant do everything for everybody last year we spent &# billion in research and development its a serious job to prioritize everything thats in the pipeline and decide where we are going to spend those precious resources the third thing is we place a huge emphasis on making genentech a great place to work eight or nine years ago we didnt appear on many lists of the best places we started doing employee surveys asking people what do you like and more importantly what do you not like about the company what bothers you weve been pleased by the validation we made it to fortunes top list four years in a row last year we were no this year genentech slipped slightly to the no spot behind google inc wsj how do you balance the high cost of innovation with the pressure to cut cancer drug prices dr levinson since when our company was founded the biotech industry has lost &# billion in aggregate i think its the biggest money losing industry of all time it is hemorrhaging there are some exceptions we are doing well and amgen is doing well but for most of the to companies or of them public this is a money losing enterprise you dont just crank these drugs out my lab cloned a portion of the breast cancer gene in and we started making antibodies to it in the mid s then we got cell culture results in the late s and by the early s we were getting animal results and then approval was in december so this goes back a long long time unless these companies can get a return we are not going to get the new medicines that are making such a difference to patients lives right now theres another way to look at it look at how much society is investing in cancer in the absence of better care of everybody out there is going to get cancer and half of those are going to die of cancer its the leading cause of death among americans under age so how much are we spending on drugs for cancer we have a &# trillion gdp gross domestic product and were spending &# billion if i do that math th of gdp for the leading cause of death and people say cancer drugs are bankrupting america give me a break wsj so what led you to cap the price of avastin at &# a year dr levinson that came out of a lot of feedback from payers and patients we have patients on avastin for a very long time we have healthy margins on the drug we have to have healthy margins because so few of the drugs make it but at that point we can afford to give the drug free that was part of it once or twice a year we will bring in payers patients people who are complaining strongly and understandably about the high price of drugs we bring them in for a two day symposium and you can audit our books our margins are respectable but not off the chart they are not microsoft margins they are not oracles margins even at the end of the day its not that everybody applauds and says were happy paying the price of your drug but they understand what goes into the equation and the vast majority of them say this was a revelation now we understand it wsj whats your reaction to the democrats in congress who are trying to pave the way for generic versions of biotech drugs dr levinson theres a lot of impetus to allow the fda food and drug administration to approve generics our position is we dont mind that nobody is looking for free handouts here but whats missing from the waxman schumer clinton bill is an appreciation for the complexity of the science involved in producing a generic biologic in a pill makers of pharmaceutical pills can show chemical equivalence easily but if you are producing a biological it is not made by chemical synthesis it is made by a chinese hamsters ovary cell or an e coli bacterium a very complex route we do not yet have analytical techniques to tell you that a copy is clinically identical to the innovators drug our recommendation to the fda would be to simply require a clinical trial to make sure that the drug is behaving in the clinic as expected wsj you recently said that the factor limiting r&amp d isnt money but the ability to find the best people arent we producing enough people dr levinson i think bill gates made a comment about immigration and the fact that we make it most difficult for the smartest people to come into this country were tightly constrained in terms of bringing great scientists from great britain france or germany we struggle to bring in these incredible people who are going to help the economy help patients and help our business grow at the end of the day it will only be good but we are making it tough on ourselves wsj you have an unusual situation in which some doctors are treating macular degeneration with your cancer drug avastin even though it hasnt been approved for that use rather than your pricey eye drug lucentis which has been and now the government wants to set up a bake off comparing them but you made the decision not to supply drugs for the trials why dr levinson to give everybody perspective i have to go back in time fifteen years ago one of our scientists napoleone ferrara had purified a protein vegf vascular endothelial growth factor that induces blood vessels to form its been a theory for probably years that cancers have some weird way of bringing in blood vessels that nurse the tumor and allow the cancer to grow ferrara showed that lo and behold of cancers overexpress this protein it was a semirational leap of faith that if you interfered with this protein you could block the nourishment of the tumors from blood vessels that led to the development of avastin a monoclonal antibody that blocks vegf and is now used in colorectal and lung cancer about or years ago ferrara showed that in patients with macular degeneration theres also a very high level of vegf theres too much vessel formation at the back of the eye near the retina so he thought maybe an antibody to vegf might also help amd the leading cause of blindness over age so we spent two years doing protein engineering we made it bind more tightly smaller to reach the back of the eye and noninflammatory we made three important changes and ended up with lucentis we did a phase i study and showed that this drug doesnt cause any problems we did a phase ii study and we started seeing some incredible near miraculous results we did the phase iii trial and it confirmed absolutely the phase ii results and we published the data and people saw that an antibody to vegf can potentially save vision but the drug lucentis wasnt approved that was in mid lucentis won approval for eye use on june this is a disease that over the course of days you can go from vision to losing your eyesight its very very quick and once you lose your vision its gone and you will probably never get it back the fda takes a very very long time to approve the drug but there was avastin out there and it was already approved so you could if you wanted to make a leap of faith that the avastin molecule would also work in macular degeneration but avastin is not approved for that wsj theres a big difference in cost &# a shot for the approved eye drug lucentis versus &# a shot if a doctor splits off a small fractional dose of the cancer drug avastin which was priced to be given in a large iv infusion into tiny opthalmic syringes so it is cheaper as an eye shot dr levinson theres a big difference in cost right we did phase iii clinical trials of lucentis that cost &# to &# per patient the most expensive clinical development program genentech ever undertook we spent two years to do all kinds of protein engineering to make lucentis it is a very expensive enterprise what would you suggest we do we have &# billion to spend on r&amp d there are people dying of all kinds of cancers and immunological diseases and everything we have what we believe are other potential absolutely breakthrough therapies would you take your money and do a two year extraordinarily expensive equivalence trial researchers say such a trial of lucentis vs avastin would cost &# million furthermore access is not a problem with lucentis its very very difficult to come across a patient who at the end of the day wont have access to lucentis either by insurance or by co pay assistance programs or by our free drug programs i have a philosophy i invite criticism but dont ever come to me with a complaint without saying here is what we might do to make it better i am happy to hear part a if i hear part b
