part by the huntsman alliance and the firm says it expects being first to market with the new high iq kids brand will give it an important edge in the marketplace in return cabana life is giving the woodlands texas based company something all its heft and deep pockets cant buy marketing cachet with the fashion and lifestyle press and clout with consumers cabana life hangs tags touting huntsmans "high iq" sun protection technology from its apparel which is designed for women and children and is sold in upscale boutiques nationwide as well as on web sites including nordstrom com and babystyle com and it has landed high iq mentions in magazines like people stylewatch shape and oprah winfreys o cabana life also devotes a page of its web site to flogging the merits of the technology and includes a link back to huntsmans own high iq web site "they more or less represent what is great about the free enterprise system " says huntsman ceo peter huntsman "and im not sure a company of our size or stature could ever have made it into the oprah magazine its these smaller companies where you see the creativity and the dynamic ideas coming through " even though uv protection is a small niche business for huntsman the ceo says a small firm like cabana life gives a business to business company like his direct access to consumers which can help drive sales demand for his products on a new level partnering with them mr huntsman says "is good economic sense and good business strategy for us " the quid pro quo strategic agreement illustrates a way small businesses can negotiate strategic alliances with big partners who might otherwise not give them the time of day the key is to offer the big companies something they cant do themselves whether its on a manufacturing distribution or marketing level "my guess is that most small businesses on some level have the seed for this " says dale k cohen head of dkc resources a n y based marketing strategy and growth catalyst firm "the question is how do they look into their own arsenal and what can they do to open their mind up to what they can bring to the table " the roots of cabana lifes deal began in with the companys now year old founder melissa papock who battled skin cancer at age in her quest to make a fashionable line of lightweight uv protective clothing ms papock a former merchandising editor for fashion entertainment and lifestyle magazines including vanity fair self and allure scoured the internet for companies that specialized in sun repellant technology "i didnt even know what the terminology was at that point " she says ms papock eventually stumbled upon ciba specialty chemicals inc a giant swiss manufacturer of chemical effects for everything from color to moisture control strength used in things like paper automobiles and clothing several telephone calls to the company got her through to the companys textile effects division in high point n c where a representative explained how cibas "tinofast cel" additive could boost ms papocks apparel to the +uv protection she wanted cibas textile effects business was acquired by huntsman in july of what ms papock didnt know is that ciba was in the process of trying to rebrand its technology to make it more consumer friendly what she did know was that a big chemical company would have a hard time getting the time of day from a vogue or glamour magazine "these fashion editors arent going to be talking about this textile effect because theres nothing very sexy about it " she says "but when you add it to a stylish tunic suddenly it has more legs " figuring she might have something to offer ms papock asked for a face to face meeting with craig white cibas marketing head of apparel there she proposed a broader marketing partnership where cabana life would help drive awareness of cibas technology among consumers in return she hoped for help from the bigger player be it with discounts on additives or other aid says mr white now with huntsman "obviously your first reaction is that she has a lot of gumption but quite honestly we are not the best at advertising and media what i saw in melissa was an opportunity to give us exposure through what she was trying to do " even just being "in talks" had benefits mr white sent his team to the factory in china where ms papocks clothing is manufactured to teach workers how to treat the fabric and when independent lab tests of cabana life clothing showed the uv rating wasnt high enough mr white helped troubleshoot and fix the problems sometimes emailing with ms papock at midnight mr papock was able to step in when ciba decided to launch its "high iq" brand as an umbrella name for its textile colors and effects replacing "tinofast cel" in the uv category and create a line of new high iq hangtags for manufacturers to attach to their products "tinofast cel sounded very scary and not consumer friendly " says ms papock whod declined to use any hangtags with that name she says she was brainstorming on other names for ciba when the company came up with high iq itself which she liked delays ensued on the partnership in part because of huntsmans acquisition of the ciba division but late last year the two companies finally reached an agreement as to how they could more specifically help each other with ms papock touting the high iq brand and huntsman giving her one year rights to market clothes under their new "high iq sun protection for kids" brand she never got discounts "i think there is a perception that what is this large company going to want with me " she says "but here i am and the ceo of huntsman who runs a &# billion company finds value in me "
