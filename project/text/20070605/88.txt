the evening wrap the g s cold spring online edition vladimir putin may not tear off his shoe and begin pounding on the table nikita khrushchev style at this weeks group of eight summit but relations between moscow and the west have scarcely been frostier since the cold war early today president bush sought to reassure moscow that it has nothing to fear from the proposed missile shield that the administration wishes to install in eastern europe over the weekend mr putin the russian president said in an interview that if washington went ahead with its plans to install equipment for the shield in the czech republic and poland then he would retaliate by retargeting his missiles toward europe mr putin accused the u s of trying to install bases and weapons around the old soviet bloc in an effort to lure russia into a new arms race today mr bush said that "russia is not the enemy " mr bush and mr putin will have a face to face meeting on the sidelines of the g gathering and speaking to the media in prague mr bush said he would tell his russian counterpart that "the cold war is over it ended " he said "my message will be vladimir i call him vladimir you shouldnt fear a missile defense system as a matter of fact why dont you cooperate with us on a missile defense system " washington says that the shield is intended to protect against attack by iran or other rogue or terrorist elements and mr bush vowed to make it open to scrutiny by russian military officials and scientists at the same time however the bush administration is concerned that moscow is throwing around its vast energy wealth to draw political concessions from its neighbors and trying to tighten kremlin control over various energy projects in russia that have been driven by western firms last year moscow appeared to shove royal dutch shell and its japanese partners out of the sakhalin oil and gas venture to give control of the project to state run energy giant gazprom in the weeks leading up to this weeks g summit moscow also appeared poised to swoop in on a bp run energy project in siberia but decided to put off action on alleged regulatory matters until after this weeks meeting likely an attempt to avoid a confrontation over the issue with western powers european union members have been striking an increasingly unified line on moscow and many of mr putins once dependable friends in the eu like french president jacques chirac and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have been succeeded by more skeptical leaders relations between moscow and london have been hurt by the investigation into the polonium poisoning of a former russian spy the u k is seeking extradition of a suspect from russia but moscow has refused though mr bush frequently speaks warmly of mr putin and has even invited him for private talks at the bush family estate in maine next month mr putin has routinely criticized washington on matters ranging from economic policy to the iraq war to the detention of terrorist suspects at guantanamo bay for the most part the bush administration has avoided responding with sharp criticism of its own but after the easy tone offered earlier mr bush took a much harder stance toward russia later on charging moscow has "derailed" once promising democratic reforms the president was addressing a conference that was hosted by natan sharansky a former prisoner of the soviet union and author of "the case for democracy " a book that mr bush had admired and handed out to top aides and allies and the former czech president vaclav havel a leading figure in the velvet revolution that toppled czechoslovakias communist regime mr bush painted his approach as tough love "america can maintain a friendship and push a nation toward democracy at the same time " mr bush said "part of a good relationship is the ability to talk openly about our disagreements " stocks take a dip federal reserve chairman ben bernankes continued belief that inflation risks are
