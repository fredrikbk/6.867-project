the daily fix nascar mourns bill france jr the man who built a juggernaut online edition bill france jr who took nascar from a regional sport to a world wide phenomenon died yesterday at in the orlando sentinel ed hinton remembers the man he always called billy "that comes from knowing how far he came how hard his road was carrying nascar on his back out of the backwoods into the mainstream staring down detroit and madison avenue with his unblinking eyes transforming a podunk traveling show into the fortune s favorite sports league " he writes "william clifton france wasnt really a junior being the elder son of william henry getty france founder of nascar he had himself called bill france jr because he thought it was clearer for the dynasty " that dynasty was begun by his father big bill whom he replaced in "he was a reluctant czar up from an apprenticeship of peasantry " mr hinton writes "he had run bulldozers and earth movers in the desperate days of construction of daytona international speedway one who in the upstart days of nascar had sold tickets and waved flags and run off freeloaders who wouldnt pay their cents but once he saw the necessity of power he wielded it with a pragmatic despotism that was never regal " mr hinton writes that the younger mr frances secret was that he wasnt a visionary but "a common man who saw through the eyes of the common man thought with the uncluttered mind of the common man empathized entirely with what excited the common man it was all about the show to hell with engineering that is and was and always will be the difference between nascar and formula one the antipodal empire of motor racing on this planet " stick with mr hinton for the story of an epic showdown between mr france dale earnhardt richard childress geoff bodine and rick hendrick two drivers two owners and their sports boss it wasnt even close can anyone stop rafael nadal at the french open mr nadal beat lleyton hewitt in impressive fashion to advance to the quarterfinals mr nadal is at roland garros and hasnt lost a set in the first four rounds this year next up for mr nadal is carlos moya his friend mentor and fellow mallorcan lurking out there of course is top ranked roger federer who plays tommy robredo today though its more accurate to say mr nadal is the one lurking yes federer beat mr nadal last month in the hamburg masters final ending his rivals match streak of wins on clay but mr hewitt said he doubted federer could derail mr nadal again he thinks hamburgs heavier slower courts worked to the top ranked players advantage in a way roland garros will not in the belfast telegraph paul newman writes that "until nadal started chasing down apparently lost causes across the worlds tennis courts hewitt was arguably the games most dogged competitor as players such as tim henman repeatedly found to their cost his speed around the court his deceptively dangerous serve the quality of his all round game and his sheer bloody mindedness were a potent combination if hewitts game seems made for clay however competing on the surface does not come naturally to him most spanish players have grown up sliding into their shots on dustbowl courts with the ease that australians ride ocean waves but the likes of hewitt have to rediscover the art every time the clay court season comes around " mike wise of the washington post would like to interrupt the coronation of king james for a public service announcement "the san antonio spurs are going to school cleveland and win their fourth title in six games or fewer because they have the best player on the floor in the series tim duncan despite getting less love than jury duty is maybe the largest difference maker since jordan shaquille oneal is the only other big man from duncans generation whos won more its nice that lebron has evolved so quickly overtaking carmelo anthony and dwyane wade from his draft class but filling kobes excitement void from the playoffs is not the same as being on the verge of winning more titles than larry bird when the spurs are finished polishing off cleveland duncan will not only eclipse birds three rings he will join magic and michael as the only leading men with more than three championships with the same franchise since bill russell " tank johnson of the chicago bears will miss the first eight games of the next nfl season

sent him back into society angry and idle a bad combination for a large man with his history making his return conditional on his behavior forces johnson to show he is more than just a smooth talking con man and serious when he says he has changed " and mr haugh notes that a six game suspension will cost mr johnson &# "when johnson realizes he stands to save &# simply by staying out of trouble that should be enough incentive for him to steer clear of the lifestyle that created this mess in the first place even more loudly than goodell and the nfl did monday money talks and when it does nfl
