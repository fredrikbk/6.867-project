the morning brief court to the fcc dont be so literal online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here expletives are just that curse words invoking strong sentiment rather than denotations of the lewd or excretory language in question according to a federal appellate decision that slapped down fcc indecency rulings that threatened the television networks with massive fines for invective uttered during unscripted programming in with considerable political backing and popular outrage over perceived indecency the federal communications commission began to take a hard line on the broadcasting of such vocabulary with rulings that targeted remarks made by celebrities cher and nicole richie during foxs airing of the and billboard music awards yesterday the u s second circuit court of appeals ruled the agency failed to adequately explain why it needed a new policy sanctioning "fleeting expletives" that a court panel majority found "arbitrary and capricious " taking note of a third case when rock star bono used such an expletive while accepting a golden globe award on nbc the court pointed out that fccs enforcement bureau denied a complaint from a group called parents television council it did so "on the basis that the expletive as used in context did not describe sexual or excretory organs or activities and that the utterance was fleeting and isolated " but five months later the full commission reversed the bureaus decision perplexing the appellate judges the fcc had expanded its indecency rules under president bush and the decision to take utterances of sexual or excretory words at their immediate meanings reversed decades of more lenient policy the new york times notes and the judges pointed out that such vulgarities are often used to express frustration and excitement even by "the top leaders of our government " lawyers for nbc had cited examples of mr bush and vice president dick cheney using language that under the fcc rules would have been penalized an angry fcc chairman kevin martin himself didnt shy from using such language to make his point "i find it hard to believe that the new york court would tell american families that "s t" and "f k" are fine to say on broadcast television during the hours when children are most likely to be in the audience " he said in a statement which didnt hesitate to spell out the words "the court even says the commission is divorced from reality it is the new york court not the commission that is divorced from reality in concluding that the word f k does not invoke a sexual connotation " the court didnt rule on the constitutional issues raised by the networks but the majority said it was "skeptical" the fcc "can provide a reasoned explanation for its fleeting expletive regime that would pass constitutional muster " as the wall street journal reports the fccs chances for an appeal to the supreme court didnt seem terribly strong to many legal experts and the journal notes the case is a big win for the four major television networks and their affiliates which had millions of dollars in fines hanging over their heads military judges reject latest detainee system u s military judges yesterday threw out all charges against one guantanamo bay detainee and dismissed the charges against another in the latest setback to the bush administrations post judicial constructs and one that may force it yet again to change the rules the judges ruled that military prosecutors failed to establish the new judicial panels had jurisdiction over a detainee picked up on an afghan battlefield when he was years old and another who chauffeured osama bin laden as the guardian reports colonel peter brownback said the two were deemed "enemy combatants " not "unlawful enemy combatants " the term used by congress last year when it authorized the tribunals and that technicality may have implications for all prisoners held at guantanamo since they all received the same classification at their initial status reviews the rulings marked the second time in less than a year that courts rejected the administrations attempts to rewrite the rules on bringing terror suspects to justice the los angeles times notes in june the supreme court struck down the previous version as unconstitutional however technical the judges reasoning was the rulings will probably cause the commission to "grind to a halt until the matter is resolved" after what has already been "years of legal obstacles and internal disarray " the wall street journal says the lawful unlawful distinction hails from the bush administrations use of international law to argue that only some enemy combatants like uniformed soldiers have the right to fight the u s a category that doesnt include the likes of al qaeda and the taliban and yet it had been the administration that wrote the rules that brought this distinction to the fore yesterday the journal notes the administration will likely appeal the decisions to what the new york times notes is another new institution the court of military commission review and legal experts tell the times that if the decisions are sustained the administration can try amending defense department regulations or the military commissions act ask
