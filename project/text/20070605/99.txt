troubled portraits a firing exposes worries over medical photo method total body pictures aim to prevent cancer a pioneer sues nyu new york in "total body photography " patients typically strip nude and stand on a platform while a photographer snaps two dozen pictures covering every inch of their skin bill slue pioneered the procedure at new york university medical center hoping it could save lives by letting doctors monitor unusual moles in people who might develop skin cancer mr slue a native of jamaica who never graduated from college was appointed to the medical school faculty at nyu and celebrated as an innovator in dermatology nyu is now struggling to distance itself from the photographer while contending that his technique is still valid the hospital fired mr slue in january accusing him of taking extra photographs of female patients for his personal enjoyment he denies that the accusation followed an nyu investigation in which an attractive undercover operative visited mr slues studio posing as a patient robert glickman dean of the nyu medical school says its important to separate the man from the method "the technique is not going to die its tremendous " says dr glickman who is also chief executive of nyu medical center "the issue is what he did with the technique he abused it " a year old former jehovahs witnesses minister mr slue says the "extra" photos were backups that he needed for professional purposes in years not one of the more than patients he photographed complained about his conduct he says a number of nyu faculty members are backing their former colleague saying he was framed by a subordinate the case has been the talk of dermatology circles even as total body photography gains popularity a review said a majority of doctors who are starting careers as dermatologists use the technique a growing number of major health insurers are covering total body photography in certain cases medicare has begun reimbursing for it according to the american academy of dermatology allan halpern chief of dermatology at memorial sloan kettering cancer center says he fears patients will become skittish about being photographed even though he believes total body photography "is the only objective tool we have" to track unusual moles in people at risk mr slue came to the u s from jamaica as a teenager he graduated from wingate high school in brooklyn and took a few college courses but never graduated in the mid s he got a job at nyu as a medical photographer he met his former wife claudia in the late s when she was referred to him as an nyu patient after watching claudia deal with her skin cancer known as melanoma mr slue realized that there was no effective method to track patients moles over time working with nyu dermatologist alfred kopf mr slue devised a way to capture the whole body on film using sectional photographs the goal was to give doctors a baseline to judge which moles were new or quickly changing in size or color indicating the need for urgent attention and which were stable over time in with mr slue as lead author they published a paper in the medical journal archives of dermatology outlining the method today many major hospitals and academic medical centers are equipped to provide the service also a handful of stand alone centers specialize in total body photography typically people get the set of pictures only once the technique is most often recommended for patients at risk of developing melanoma a form of skin cancer affecting more than people in the u s annually some of these patients may have dozens of moles that are unusual in size shape or color others have a family history of melanoma or already have had a cancerous mole removed if a potentially cancerous mole is caught early doctors say it can almost always be treated with simple outpatient surgery but if the lesion grows thicker than millimeter the risk of fatal cancer rises ron hopkinson a year old lawyer with a family history of melanoma and many moles got a set of total body photographs five years ago "its been absolutely terrific " he says "it allows them to take the moles off before they become a problem and i dont worry because i know they got them early " some dermatologists still believe that simply tracking moles visually with regular exams is sufficient one concern is the expense hospitals generally bill several hundred dollars for total body photography and there havent been any large clinical studies to show whether the benefit to patients is worth the cost at his peak mr slue says he earned &# a year at nyu he became the supervisor of the photography unit at the medical centers dermatology department he simultaneously operated a private total body photography business out of his nyu office he paid the hospital &# a month in rent and directly pocketed the fees when he took total body pictures after photo sessions lasting three or four minutes mr slue would assemble total body "albums" at his home office he says he would hand over the albums to patients and sometimes their doctors while destroying any unused images for years mrs slue acted as a chaperone standing near patients as their pictures were taken as well as bookkeeper and receptionist the couple divorced in but remain on friendly terms nyu promoted mr slues story a new york television station featured him on the news a few years after he published his paper about the technique "a man looked through the lens of a camera and saw a way to fight skin cancer " the piece began "william slue had an idea that can indeed save lives " in anne stoecker joined nyu as an assistant to mr slue initially mr slue impressed her as "a cool boss " ms stoecker says in an interview and the two discussed personal matters for instance ms stoecker then pounds was concerned about her weight and mr slue introduced her to a woman who had had weight loss surgery ms stoecker underwent the operation and lost pounds ms stoecker says her boss was "very professional with the patients " but less so with her according to her testimony in a court case that mr slue brought against nyu over his dismissal he barraged her almost daily with sexually charged comments she said he spoke about patients "hot" bodies and rated the quality of their breast implants he told lewd jokes and used profanities she said on one occasion he told her he was aroused when she climbed on a ladder wearing plaid knee socks she told the court "it was an awful environment to be in " ms stoecker says around the time ms stoecker came to nyu mr slue was gradually switching to digital photography in his total body work she noticed that in the middle of a digital photo session he would pull out his millimeter film camera and take several extra photographs of some patients usually pretty women she says mr slue says the extra photos were backups one day at a conference ms stoecker met daphne demas who had worked for nyu and mr slue from until ms demas hadnt complained about mr slue while working at nyu according to court testimony but when the two women compared notes they agreed that mr slues statements were often offensive according to ms stoecker ms demas didnt return calls seeking comment at first ms stoecker says she worried about accusing the popular mr slue of harassment hoping nyu would force him out on other grounds she complained to its compliance unit in june that he was blurring the lines between his work as a hospital employee and his private business operating on hospital property when the compliance unit didnt act on her initial complaint ms stoecker came forward with her harassment allegations and persuaded ms demas to do likewise in early nyu hired a private investigative firm decision strategies llc the firm later absorbed into a canadian security company is no relation to the texas based consulting firm decision strategies inc decision strategies llc searched the internet in vain for evidence that mr slue sold nude photos online and found nothing incriminating on his computer hard drive jeff kern who led the investigation then fashioned a plan to test nyus theory that mr slue was stashing away extra pictures for his personal pleasure according to mr kern and court testimony on jan an undercover operative given the fictitious name of iris cortez showed up in mr slues office for a total body photography session ms cortez was chosen based on ms stoeckers description of the physical characteristics that attracted mr slue mr kern says in an interview that the plan was to send two more operatives to mr slue a beautiful slim fair haired russian actress followed by the "control " a heavyset professional artists model in her early s that plan was never carried out "it should have been followed " mr kern says "nobody wins if you rush to judgment " during the photo session with ms cortez which the agent recorded on a hidden camera mr slue took several pictures with a millimeter film camera in addition to digital images he says ms cortez posed a technical challenge because she had few if any obvious moles he used his film camera which he felt produced a superior image to take backup shots he says when the slides from the cortez session came back from the lab ms stoecker secretly took them from mr slues briefcase photographed them and returned them she showed the nine images to a compliance officer and several nyu administrators they were disturbed the images did not look like the kind of pictures that appeared in total body photo albums because they included ms cortezs face breasts and sometimes genitals in a single picture mr slue says he never intended to put these photos in any album he says he planned to destroy the film once he confirmed that the digital images were adequate and if the film images had been needed he would have cropped them to include only a section of skin a few days after the cortez session mr slue was summoned to a meeting by irwin freedberg chairman of nyus dermatology department shown the nude images of ms cortez mr slue tried to give his explanation he says there was little interest in it mr slue was suspended from work and escorted out of the hospital by nyu security guards on jan ms stoecker ms demas and mr kern entered an nyu office where some of mr slues old film slides were stored reviewing slides of about patients they claimed to find a pattern of certain slides missing from the numbered series among the young slim and attractive women but not from other groups combined with the other suspicions that was evidence enough for the nyu administration on jan mr slue was fired after refusing to meet administrators without his lawyer present an examination by decision strategies later determined that some of the missing images were from heavyset and older women and that the pattern wasnt always in evidence there werent any missing slides for male patients the report said mr slue says the missing slides were pictures that he threw out because he didnt need them he says he was careful particularly with women to take enough shots so they wouldnt have to make a return visit and that sometimes resulted in surplus photos "ninety nine percent of the patients that i am photographing are not african american patients and i am an african american man " mr slue later testified "and i know the trepidation that happens in many peoples mind going to somebody like me to have to totally undress and have their pictures taken so i am going to be determined that number one they never have to come back to have it done and number two they never have to say the person was not competent to do the job correctly " soon after mr slue was fired ms stoecker was promoted to his job and nyu began offering total body photography in house in february dr freedberg the dermatology chairman sent emails to nyu affiliates about the slue case "i am confident that if you had seen the evidence that i did " he wrote in one email "you would have come to the same conclusion i reached and would have completely supported the action the institution took " the next month mr slue filed a lawsuit against nyu alleging wrongful termination and nine other claims a judge dismissed all of them except an allegation that dr freedbergs emails libeled mr slue in september after an eight day trial in u s district court in the southern district of new york a jury found that the emails from dr freedberg who died from a brain tumor before the trial were defamatory but finding no "malice" in the emails it ruled in favor of the defendants joel cohen nyus outside lawyer says nyu had both moral and legal grounds to dismiss mr slue "if this person was abusing a position of trust one of these patients would turn around and sue the hospital " he said bill witmer a medical photographer who provided an affidavit on mr slues behalf for the trial says the case is a reminder of peoples fears in an era when images can instantly become accessible world wide on the internet "im sure many patients have it in the back of their minds whether they should be worried about their photos " mr witmer says "but i always tell them its in my best interest if i want to grow my business to protect your privacy and protect your images " today mr slue ekes out a living shooting photos of a handful of patients the dermatological photographic society dropped him as president he says his annual income has fallen below &# some former nyu colleagues raised &# to help pay for his childrens education meanwhile mr slues method continues to gain acceptance dr halpern of memorial sloan kettering believes as much as of the adult caucasian population could be candidates
