the middle seat what happens when airlines break customer service rules transportation department often waives fines it levies working the weather excuse on christmas eve comair inc s overtaxed crew scheduling computer system collapsed forcing more than flight cancellations and leaving thousands of passengers stranded the airline a regional affiliate of delta air lines refused to pay some customers for hotel rooms blaming the cancellations on a severe storm the u s department of transportation recently ruled that comair had acted illegally its punishment a &# fine that likely will never have to be paid amid cries in congress for a passenger bill of rights it turns out there is little enforcement of existing customer service regulations the dots enforcement office aggressively prosecutes airlines for violations of wheelchair and disability access requirements and keeps a sharp eye on airline advertisements to make sure fuel surcharges and taxes are adequately flagged but "when it comes to other areas of customer service dot enforcement is milquetoast " says ken mead a former dot inspector general who is now a washington attorney "theres got to be a cop on the beat and i dont see it " the dot says it has been more active in the past two years opening "several dozen consumer protection investigations" as a direct result of concerns raised about enforcement the comair case was one of the rare times the government documented a deception that many travelers believe happens too frequently airline employees lying to customers about the real reasons for cancellations blaming bad weather so they wont be financially responsible for hotels meals and any possible compensation but it also shows how insignificant dot fines are when airlines do violate contract terms in tickets or federal regulations the dot typically forgives at least half of the fines levied under the consent orders it reaches with airlines if they promise not to repeat the practice for at least a year the dot also reduces fines if airlines spend on improvements such as retraining for telephone or gate agents who arent up to speed on issues like accommodating disabled travelers ual corp s united airlines got out of most of a &# fine on oct for not having proper in cabin storage for folding wheelchairs on some of its boeing s by agreeing to put up eight new flight information monitors at chicagos ohare international airport thats something the airline likely would have done anyway the airport is its biggest hub but the dot reduced the fine by &# on the theory that the new screens would improve service for the hearing impaired a dot spokesman says forgiving fines "provides an incentive for future compliance " repeat offenders are given full penalties he notes a look at all dot enforcement actions against airlines on customer service issues over the past year shows consent orders were signed with scheduled service carriers large and small domestic and international seven involved fare advertisements or displays on booking web sites three involved disabled access issues four others involved infractions at small airlines ranging from misreporting the cause of flight delays to failing to make prompt credit card refunds to operating charter flights without dot approval and then there was the comair fiasco when thousands of travelers were left stranded in december for several days before christmas a severe storm forced scores of flight cancellations at the airlines cincinnati hub when the weather cleared the comair computer system that reschedules crews was swamped and at p m on christmas eve it shut down overwhelmed comair canceled all of its flights scheduled for christmas day normal operations didnt resume until late on dec at p m on dec according to the dot and comair an email was sent to employees companywide saying the "cancellations are the result of the severe weather " the dot received complaints from four customers who said they were told by comair employees they werent eligible for hotel vouchers because their flights were canceled by bad weather even though the company knew that all flights canceled on dec and later were the result at least in part of the computer problem the dot said "by misleading consumers in this manner comair engaged in an unfair and deceptive practice " the dot concluded comair said it did provide free hotel rooms and reimburse many customers for expenses on a case by case basis it also distributed one billion delta frequent flier miles and travel vouchers to affected customers "we provided a great deal to customers " says a comair spokeswoman still comair argued to the dot that the company technically wasnt required to pay for customer accommodations because the confluence of the storm and computer failure constituted a force majeure event a major catastrophe like war or a labor strike that exempts the airline from responsibility under the contract terms in tickets the dot rejected the force majeure claim and said in its may decision "we view seriously any carriers failure to honor commitments made to consumers " but officials agreed to forgive &# of the fine if comair doesnt get caught again blaming weather for its own service problems over the next year the other &# wont have to be paid either if comair spends that much on extra accommodations for stranded customers this year "were confident we can meet the department of transportations objectives " the comair spokeswoman says the dots current inspector general calvin scovel iii testified to congress in april that the dot needed to take a more active role in airline customer service issues while the dot "has made efforts to enforce civil rights violations it needs to improve its oversight of consumer protection laws " he said mr mead the previous inspector general had pushed for an increase in funding and staff for the dots office of general counsel to boost enforcement activity congress added funding in other than enforcement of disability access issues "i havent seen the results " mr mead says "and its disappointing " some transportation law experts say the dots enforcement office is considered to be nitpicky on some small easy issues but absent on big ones part of the reason may be that the dot has firmer ground for enforcing disability issues because laws like the air carrier access act lay out very specific requirements that airlines must fulfill on broader customer service issues though the dot has lots of latitude but few specifics on whats required "i believe an aggressive office could use the existing statute to do a lot more " says one aviation consultant and former high ranking dot official one area where the dot has recently taken an active interest is chronically late flights earlier this spring the dot sent letters notifying carriers of an investigation into airline practices on such flights including whether on time performance is disclosed to customers as required "some flights arrive minutes late of the time why is that allowed " mr mead asks "i think they the dot need a tougher more pro consumer attitude " the enforcers some reasons enforcement actions by the department of transportation against airlines have been criticized as toothless many of the fines levied are often trimmed for good behavior airlines can earn credit against fines by retraining employees or by buying new equipment few big fines are levied against major airlines
