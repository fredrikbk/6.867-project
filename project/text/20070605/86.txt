the afternoon report thirty months for libby online edition i lewis "scooter" libby the former chief of staff for vice president cheney was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for perjury and obstructing the investigation into the leaking of central intelligence agency employee valerie plames identity to the media u s district judge reggie walton said that the evidence had overwhelmingly demonstrated mr libbys guilt and said that those who hold senior government jobs "where they have the welfare and security of nation in their hands have a special obligation to not do anything that might create a problem " mr libby was the highest ranking white house official to be convicted of a crime since the reagan era iran contra scandal ms plames identity was revealed in a july column by robert novak she alleged that she had been identified by the administration in an effort to discredit her husband former ambassador joseph wilson who was a prominent critic of the iraq war mr libby had said little over the course of his legal struggle and he offered only brief comments to the court today "it is respectfully my hope that the court will consider along with the jury verdict my whole life " he said judge walton ordered mr libby to pay a fine of &# and placed him on probation for two years following his release from prison the judge didnt immediately rule on whether mr libby would be allowed to remain free pending appeal special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald had sought to have mr libby serve up to three years because of what he viewed as the serious nature of the investigation that the former aide had obstructed but defense lawyers argued that seeking to increase the penalty on such grounds was unfair pointing out that nobody had even been charged with a crime related to the exposure of ms plames position at the intelligence agency "the government did not establish the existence of an offense " attorney william jeffress said mr libbys defenders have argued virtually from the start of his legal ordeal that the trial was a political stunt and that the charges against him should have been thrown out because investigators failed to uncover any criminal wrongdoing in the leaking of ms plames name but judge walton rejected that defense argument by such reasoning he said witnesses would have a robust incentive to aggressively obstruct investigations in order to prevent prosecutors from being able to make a case "i just cant buy in on that being good social policy " he said "its one thing if you obstruct a petty larceny its another thing if you obstruct a murder investigation " whatever the ultimate outcome of the appeals process mr libby might expect that he will be pardoned by president bush a move that many of the critics of the governments case have agitated for since mr libbys conviction in march pardon advocates say that not only did investigators not unearth any underlying crime but also that mr libby wasnt even the original leaker former deputy secretary of state richard armitage has acknowledged that he first mentioned ms plames to washington post reporter bob woodward and that inaccurate comments that he made to investigators were because of a spotty memory the white house hasnt ruled out a pardon and a spokeswoman said at the time of the conviction that "theres a process in place for all americans if they want to receive a pardon from a president " pardons for figures swept up in washington political controversies arent unprecedented president bushs father pardoned a number of figures who were involved

trying to tone down an uproar over a proposed missile shield in eastern europe that has angered russia and led president vladimir putin to say that he might retarget some of his countrys missiles toward the continent said following a meeting with czech leaders in prague today that "russia is not the enemy " mr bush and mr putin will cross paths at the group of eight summit which will begin tomorrow in germany "the cold war is over it ended " mr bush told reporters at a news conference "my message will be vladimir i call him vladimir you shouldnt fear a missile defense system as a matter of fact why dont you cooperate with us on a missile defense system " radar sites for the system would be placed in the czech republic and poland both nations are still negotiating with the u s though czech president vaclav klaus said at the news conference that he and mr bush had a frank and open exchange about the shield and that "we understand each other " public opinion polls show that many people in both the czech republic and poland are opposed to the missile shield fearing that it could make the countries targets for a terror attack or that moscow may vent its anger in ways that could leave them in the crosshairs later in the day mr bush appeared to strike a much tougher stance toward russia saying that moscow has "derailed" once promising democratic reforms "in russia reforms that once promised to empower citizens have been derailed with troubling implications for democratic development " the president said at a conference of political dissidents hosted by natan sharansky a former prisoner of the soviet union and author of a book called "the case for democracy" that mr bush admired and handed out to top aides and allies and the former czech president vaclav havel a leading figure in the velvet revolution that toppled czechoslovakias communist regime mr bush appeared to paint his comments as a tough love approach toward moscow "america can maintain a friendship and push a nation toward democracy at the same time " mr bush said "part of a good relationship is the ability to talk openly about our disagreements " there was no immediate reaction to the presidents speech from mr putin though the remarks seemed quite likely to further irritate the russian leader in the context of the missile shield dispute besides their meeting on the sidelines of the

policy conference in south africa that it will sound quite familiar to anyone who has been tuning into the central banks recent policy communiques he said that the economy is likely to expand at a moderate pace this year even if the housing slump continues and that inflation risks remain tilted toward the upside in another echo of earlier remarks mr bernanke said that the subprime mortgage shakeout will continue with more delinquencies and foreclosures this year and next as adjustable rate mortgages reset to higher rates treasury yields have been climbing in recent weeks a sign that mortgage rates may be moving up in the near term but repeated his belief that problems in the subprime arena appear "unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system "
