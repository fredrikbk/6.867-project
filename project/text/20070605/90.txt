the gasoline game why drivers pay a lot more in chicago than in houston to fill their tanks the uneven refinery effect how much it costs to fill up the tank depends on where you are over the past five months the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the u s has soared almost to &# a gallon but prices have climbed faster in some places than in others people in chicago have seen prices go up to &# but people in san francisco who have long paid some of the highest fuel prices saw a rise to &# "its just so shocking " says chicago resident margy belchak who spent &# on gasoline recently during a trip to michigan driving a honda civic that gets about miles per gallon "nobody has ever seen prices that high " the high gasoline prices of recent months largely are the result of tight refinery capacity thus areas hit by a spate of refinery outages like the midwest have seen their fuel prices climb much more sharply than others and areas where refinery capacity remains ample are experiencing much more moderate increases while americans are used to relentless price competition on everything from airline tickets to tennis shoes theres not a lot they can do to slash their gas bill beside drive less illinois public interest research group part of the nationwide pirg federation of consumer groups is advising drivers there to tune up their cars inflate their tires and empty their trunks chicago resident todd shissler saves more than cents a gallon by filling up in nearby lincolnwood ill where gas costs &# a gallon compared with &# at some stations in chicago in the past week gas prices nationally actually have been edging down as refineries come on line and more gas imports enter the country but once again the effects are being felt unevenly while prices have fallen about cents in the midwest theyve dropped only a couple of cents in the rocky mountains "its like the weather its very uneven across the country " says tom kloza chief oil analyst at oil price information service which tracks the refining industry to be sure costs are always higher for certain places than for others for one gasoline taxes vary widely from state to state in new york for example taxes as of march were almost cents a gallon while in alaska they ran only cents a gallon according to api an oil industry trade group transportation costs also bump up gas prices in places far from refineries prices in the midwest which has to ship in about of the gas it consumes are usually more expensive than in the gulf coast the countrys major refining hub but currently most of the difference in prices can be attributed to refinery snags that have affected some regions more than others although they have fallen slightly fuel prices in chicago are still among the highest in the country most of the increase can be tracked to a single refinery just outside the city in whiting ind analysts say the refinery which is owned by bp plc is one of the largest in the country but has been running at half capacity due to a fire and a power outage earlier this year that shut down some of its units at least two other refineries in the midwest also have cut production recently due to maintenance and glitches the gulf coast was also recently hit by outages at several large refineries pushing up gas prices temporarily although not as high as in the midwest because the gulf coast region produces more than double the amount of gasoline it consumes so far this week gas prices there have fallen about four cents to &# "as supplies shift around to areas where the price is higher we typically see prices decline in the high price regions and prices go up elsewhere " says dough mcintyre an analyst with energy information administration a federal agency in california gasoline prices tell yet a different story the state has some of the most stringent gas specifications in the country to cut pollution and it isnt well connected to the rest of the country via pipelines the result is that prices there are determined largely by what goes on locally although refineries in california had some trouble last year and earlier this year supplies have been steady lately this means gas prices didnt rise as much as in the rest of the country thats little comfort for alejandro catalan an architecture student who commutes about miles between east los angeles and santa monica for him prices are still too high "its limiting my expenses on other things that are also important like books or just tuition " he says analysts expect fuel costs to ease over the next few weeks as gasoline inventories rise all bets are off however if hurricanes slam into gulf coast refineries as they did in some drivers welcome the relatively lower gas prices even though they remain high compared with the beginning of the year john reneski who lives in orlando fla was pleasantly surprised to see gas about cents cheaper when he pulled into a gas station recently "i was so excited then i said what the heck is wrong with me " says the year old marketing executive "weve become numb to the price increase "
