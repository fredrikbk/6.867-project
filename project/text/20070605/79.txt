politics &amp economics showdown looms on china trade white house opposes coming legislation that may result in punitive action a showdown is brewing between the white house and capitol hill over how best to address chinas undervalued currency and other alleged unfair trade practices with little progress made on the issue during the semiannual economic summit between the u s and china last month lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are nearing completion on legislation that could result in punitive action against china at least one bill sponsored by sens charles schumer d n y and lindsey graham r s c and due to be made public in mid june if its backers can agree on its contents has a real chance of passing lawmakers and industry executives said "its a pretty formidable task thats ahead of them" in drafting the legislation said erin ennis vice president of the u s china business council a lobbying group representing companies doing business in china but the bill has an "extremely good chance of passage" given the prominence of its potential backers which include senate finance committee chairman max baucus d mont and ranking member charles grassley r iowa ms ennis said businesses are lining up on both sides of the fence though with even some industry groups members split on the issue some of the groups are declining for now to take a position on any legislation passage of punitive legislation could lead to a downturn in u s china trade flows and reduce access for u s companies to chinas booming markets that could result in higher prices for u s businesses and consumers alike especially in sectors with thin profit margins like textiles the white house says any protectionist legislation "is more likely to be counterproductive " and advocates continued economic dialogue and negotiations with the chinese but even if president bush vetoes any such legislation it could push the administration to take a tougher line on china and give it political cover to do so the u s s trade deficit with china has surged in recent years nearing &# billion last year critics contend that a major factor behind the imbalance is chinas alleged unfair trading practices including its failure to allow its currency the yuan to appreciate at a faster rate that keeps chinese export prices unfairly low giving them an advantage over rivals critics say earlier versions of the schumer graham bill had proposed imposing a import tariff on all chinese goods among other measures in response to chinas failure to boost the yuans rate sponsors have declined to comment on details of the latest schumer graham bill beyond saying that it will comply with rules of the world trade organization and that it will be "veto proof " by holding china to promises it made in its accession to the wto in the bills sponsors hope to satisfy the diversified range of u s business interests in china "we have been very frustrated with chinas lack of action " said mr schumer "were working on tough wto compliant legislation that will force china to do what it should be doing on its own " another bill also with bipartisan backing from reps artur davis d ala and phil english r pa seeks to clarify that countervailing duties can be applied to a nonmarket economy such as china such duties are generally imposed to offset the impact of unfair government subsidies until recently the u s government had taken the position that u s companies couldnt seek protection against unfair government subsidies of goods exported from "nonmarket" usually communist economies this spring the bush administration reversed that two decade old policy allowing countervailing duties to be applied to certain chinese paper imports but critics have questioned whether the administration has authority to impose such duties the davis english legislation would authorize it to do so the u s steel industry which worries about cheap chinese steel coming into the country is backing the davis english bill reps tim ryan an ohio democrat and duncan hunter an ohio republican have reintroduced a bill to define currency manipulation as a kind of subsidy that would allow the u s to seek redress for chinas yuan policy under the rules of the wto currency manipulation issues fall under the domain of the international monetary fund which has limited enforcement capabilities plenty of challenges and complications face any legislation legislation that is overly focused on currency appreciation may not work "chinese product is being delivered for less than the price of the raw materials even currency cant fix that " said frank vargo vice president for international economic affairs at the national association of manufacturers a washington based lobbying group some chinese companies play down the potential impact of any punitive legislation saying they have already diversified after the u s previously imposed tariffs on chinese goods "exports to the u s only account for around of our whole export business while the european union is our key market with more than of our exported clothing " said a department manager at hui hong knitting import &amp export ltd a unit of jiangsu huihong international group qian wang an economist with j p morgan chase said the chinese government has in fact picked up the pace of yuan appreciation "they recognize that if there is no appreciation they will be hit by tariff increases what china is trying to avoid is any sudden one off changes " the yuan has appreciated against the dollar since including a boost engineered by beijing in july it recently slightly widened the range within which the currency can trade daily some u s companies are lobbying heavily for a legislative solution to the china trade issue members of the precision metalforming association an industry group with companies which rely on globally competitive steel prices to make components visited congressional offices at the end of april to express their concerns about the chinese currency it is pushing for the ryan hunter bill which would define currency manipulation as a financial subsidy many industries remain divided with companies in various sectors and even within individual industry groups lining up on both sides of the issue the american chamber of commerce in china has voiced concern that overly political legislation could "undermine the international trade regime derail constructive dialogue and ultimately weaken the competitive position of u s business and the overall economy " u s retailers may have the most to lose both from rising import prices and from possible retaliatory measures by beijing such as restricting their access to the booming chinese consumer market even so "i dont think anyone wants to defend the indefensible " said stephanie lester vice president for international trade at the retail industry leaders association referring to chinas currency policy sue feng in beijing contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications rep duncan hunter is a republican from california a politics &amp economics article tuesday about u s legislation regarding chinas trade practices incorrectly
