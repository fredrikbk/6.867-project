the great assimilation machine for more than years the united states has been the great assimilation machine churning germans swedes italians poles greeks russians lebanese chinese indians pakistanis and myriad others into americans there are many americans today who believe or worry that the largest group of recent immigrants the nearly million hispanics who have come here in the last several decades are unwilling or unable to do the same in his book "who are we the challenges to national identity " harvard political scientist samuel p huntington warned that "mexican immigration is leading toward the demographic reconquista of areas americans took from mexico by force in the s and s " a sentiment i hear echoed frequently in the debate over immigration reform others warn that the country is playing host to a burgeoning new underclass of poorly educated welfare dependent hispanics who will overwhelm us with social pathologies still others marshal statistics that appear to support their view that hispanics are indeed failing to assimilate as have previous ethnic groups the real story of hispanic assimilation however is a lot less gloomy although a bit more complicated than the critics charge part of the problem is the interpretation of statistics as we are in the midst of a huge influx of new immigrants legal and illegal including seven million mexicans who have arrived since any statistical snapshot that includes these newcomers who make up about half the adult hispanic population will distort the overall moving picture take hispanic dropout rates a snapshot looks bad of hispanics according to the current population survey had not finished high school in but nearly half of the people counted arent dropouts in the usual sense theyve never dropped in to an american school they are immigrants who completed their schooling such as it was before coming here in their late teens or s granted low education levels will make their climb up the economic ladder slower of mexican born adults have not completed high school but the earnings of hispanic immigrants will improve as they gain work skills and experience and the evidence is strong that they will do so mexican born men for example had higher labor force participation rates than native born male workers compared with and lower unemployment rates than native workers compared with in labor force participation rates of illegal aliens are higher yet a whopping more importantly the children of hispanic immigrants are graduating from high school the high school completion rate for young u s born hispanics is only slightly lower than the of non hispanic whites hispanic immigrant children who do enroll in school after they come here are as likely as american born hispanics to earn a high school diploma although half of mexican immigrants years old do not enroll in school hispanics are more likely than either whites or blacks to continue their education at two year institutions in they represented of all students enrolled in two year institutions only of u s born hispanics earn four year degrees compared with of non hispanic whites nonetheless the economic returns on education are substantial for hispanics as a study on hispanics by the national research council of the national academy of sciences reported "we consistently find that after adjusting for the levels of human capital e g schooling and english language proficiency hispanics do almost as well as whites with respect to both employment and labor market earnings " which the authors note is not the case for blacks who still lag behind whites even after adjusting for observable measures of human capital english proficiency is of course essential if hispanics are to fully assimilate into the mainstream and one issue many americans have expressed great concern over but despite anxiety that hispanics arent learning english and will soon insist that the u s become bilingual the evidence suggests otherwise true enough most hispanic immigrants have poor english skills the census reported that million people spoke spanish at home and of these million were unable to speak english well but there is nothing unusual about this historically most immigrant groups have taken a generation or more to produce fluent english speakers in nearly years after the peak period of german immigration students attended german bilingual schools in the u s but if hispanic immigrants have been slow to learn english their american born progeny have quickly adapted english is the preferred language of virtually all u s born hispanics according to a study by the pew hispanic center indeed of third generation hispanics cannot speak spanish at all even in southern california an area with the largest population of spanish speakers in the nation of third generation mexican americans prefer to speak english at home according to a recent study by sociologists ruben rumbaut douglas massey and frank bean the fear that hispanics are or will become an isolated economically alienated group within the larger american society also does not jibe with a variety of other measures a commerce department study reported that hispanics are opening businesses at a rate three times faster than the national average in the last year for which detailed data are available there were million hispanic owned businesses generating &# billion in revenue most of these businesses are family affairs with few employees but some hispanic businesses employed or more people generating &# billion in gross receipts half of all hispanics own homes this is substantially below the of non hispanic whites that are homeowners a department of housing and urban development analysis of hispanic home ownership trends suggests that the gap can be explained by a number of factors including age home ownership increases with age but nearly twice as many hispanics as non hispanic whites are under while only of hispanics but nearly one quarter of whites are over one genuinely disturbing trend is the increase in out of wedlock births among hispanics which has risen to in from in compared with for non hispanic whites and for blacks mexican immigrants have a somewhat lower rate of unmarried childbearing this is not good but it is not clear that these unmarried mothers remain so for long or that their children grow up in fatherless homes marriage rates for hispanics are virtually the same as for non hispanic whites suggesting many unwed mothers make it to the altar eventually and they are no more likely to divorce than whites the most comprehensive study of marriage and cohabitation produced by the department of health and human services in shows that of hispanic women will marry by age compared with of non hispanic whites but only of blacks moreover of mexican origin children live in two parent families compared with about of whites but only of blacks finally consider that ultimate indicator of assimilation intermarriage one in four hispanics marries a non hispanic white spouse but nearly one third of all u s born hispanics who are married have non hispanic spouses and the percentage is slightly higher among college educated hispanic women there is a curious and provocative fact buried in all this the population reference bureau notes in its study of intermarriage that because most children of intermarriages are reported as hispanic on census data "hispanic intermarriage may have been a factor in the phenomenal growth of the u s hispanic population in recent years and it has important implications for future growth and characteristics of the hispanic population " in other words the widely cited prediction that by mid century hispanics will represent fully one third of the u s population fails to take into account that increasing numbers of these so called hispanics will have only one grandparent or great grandparent of hispanic heritage at which point hispanic ethnicity will mean little more than german italian or irish ethnicity does today ms chavez is chairman of the center for equal opportunity and the author of a number of books including "out of the barrio toward a new politics of hispanic assimilation" basic books
