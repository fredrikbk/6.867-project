chinas rich get catering private bankers tap a rising wealth pool citigroup dives right in beijing chinas legions of newly rich have given rise to a niche that once would have been unthinkable in this communist nation private banking citigroup inc s citibank china co and bank of china ltd have launched separate programs in what is expected to become a wave of banks trying to cater to the nations upper crust providing them with their own bankers to help keep and increase their wealth analysts say that in the years to come private banking will become a big revenue generator for many banks in china which now mostly rely on corporate customers for business chinas banks are looking at such potential customers as johnson chen a year old accountant at a guangzhou media company who says he became a "vip" customer at industrial &amp commercial bank of china after the bank discovered he expensed an average of &# on his credit card each month in late a wealth manager persuaded him to put almost &# into a savings account to qualify for free financial planning he did and now he has bigger plans though he isnt sure he will yet quality for the top level services "private banking is pretty new to me i dream one day of becoming a client of this elite service " he says citibank china recently became the first foreign brand to offer local clients the attention of the firms private bankers located in offices in shanghai and beijing the bank will target clients with a net worth of at least &# million "we believe that chinas robust economic growth and strong entrepreneurial culture will result in extraordinary levels of wealth creation " says andrew tung who runs citibanks private banking business "china could therefore become asias largest wealth management market outside of japan in a decade perhaps less " hong kong and singapore are now the biggest private banking hubs in asia bank of chinas private banking service also offered out of offices in beijing and shanghai has a lower threshold of &# million in personal assets because no chinese bank has ever been in the business of managing private wealth bank of china has partnered with royal bank of scotland to get financial planning expertise and management advice john shelley a private banker with a division in rbs called coutts bank von ernst says the two banks now have a "cooperation agreement " but they intend to turn it into a joint venture once they get regulatory approval probably in the next to months he says bank of china now has about to private banking clients who on average have &# lower than the stated threshold "but we know many of them are significantly more wealthy than that " he says chinas banks typically generate most of their earnings from interest income or the difference between the low interest rates paid on deposits and the high interest rates charged on corporate debt jing ulrich investment bank j p morgan chase &amp co s chairwoman of china equities says about of bank earnings reflect interest income with the governments recent and sustained crackdown on easy credit chinese banks have had to find other means to stay profitable and high end retail customers are obvious targets "chinese banks will shift away from lending to corporate customers only " ms ulrich says "they will have to earn the trust of retail customers by creating private banking credit cards and consumer lending " the push to openly court chinas wealthy has accelerated since chinas parliament in march approved a law protecting private property a signal of growing acceptance of wealth in the nation the approval capped many years of pressure from chinas expanding private sector for greater protection for individuals since all property previously was state owned the ranks of chinas wealthy are increasing though official data from china are hard to come by a merrill lynch capgemini report from estimates the mainland has superrich people with at least &# million in net assets who collectively possess &# trillion of assets their average net worth is nearly &# million merrill puts the number of people with a net worth of more than &# million at about it is unclear how chinas wealthy will be affected by recent declines in the shanghai stock index down over the past four sessions it is estimated that about &# trillion in household savings has flowed into the market during its more than doubling of the past two years officials have been trying to cool the speculative ardor that had caused that huge run up but they also fear that a market collapse could have broad economic consequences like slower spending in the past five years chinese banks have started offering wealth management services to local residents that is often considered less exclusive since these clients qualify with just hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings rather than the millions of dollars typically required in the rest of the world for private banking in china the lowest bar for private banking is &# million in net worth in april beijing bank opened its first wealth management center in zhongguancun known as the countrys silicon valley from where many of chinas young and rich have emerged the bank which joins china construction bank corp china merchants bank co and china minsheng banking corp in offering the service says it will target clients with assets of more than &# restrictions on how and where banks can invest make private banking a relatively immature and narrow service banks arent allowed to invest customers money in domestic stocks and only recently were permitted to invest small sums in foreign equities the upshot is that private bankers get very little elbow room to do their job says yi wang a partner at mckinsey &amp co in shanghai mostly investors can put their money in short and medium term corporate and government bonds asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities "private banking is a vague notion in chinese banking " mr yi says despite the limitations analysts say many banks in china are leveraging their wealth management services to build up a following so that when china allows them to offer a more complete range of services for private banking they will have the client base to support their operations citibank china and bank of china have used the opposite strategy analysts say by plunging right into the nascent sector and learning from scratch bank of china officials say its private banking push will serve as a training ground as well as a revolving door for an indigenous pool of qualified private bankers in an industry where strong credentials inspire confidence many of chinas old school wealth managers dont have m b a s or certifications such as that of chartered financial analyst guan jian general manager of bank of chinas private banking department in shanghai concedes that training a local talent pool will require many years of patient work "well need to expose them to international practices and equip them with a global perspective on how private banking is done " she says zhou yang and shai oster contributed to this article
