bushs support for musharraf tested by crisis pakistans unrest fuels calls for u s to engage opponents of regime the growing political crisis in pakistan is testing the bush administrations unconditional support for pakistans strongman president amid mounting popular unrest and the re emergence of legitimate opposition leaders seeking to end his seven year military rule u s officials acknowledge that president pervez musharraf is increasingly vulnerable but they expect him to weather the storm perhaps by winning a new five year presidential term from pakistans parliament even so there are growing calls in washington for the u s to begin distancing itself from the pakistani leader and more directly engaging prominent opponents of his regime gen musharraf set off the crisis three months ago when he suspended pakistans top judge chief justice iftikhar chaudhry who is believed to oppose constitutional changes that would allow gen musharraf to serve another term as president without relinquishing his post as army chief of staff outrage over the suspension has eroded gen musharrafs support in what had been considered his principal constituencies pakistans business community and middle class experts and politicians in both the u s and pakistan say the bush administrations continued embrace of gen musharraf risks damaging washingtons long term influence in a country that is viewed as the linchpin in the u s war on terrorism and the fight against nuclear proliferation it is also considered a key to regional stability in addition to promoting a secular society gen musharrafs government has pursued a peace initiative with rival nuclear power india over the long disputed territory of kashmir but growing anti musharraf sentiment among both progressive secular pakistanis and conservative islamists has been increasingly translating into anti americanism in recent months experts and policy makers say and they fear that a long or violent political transition in pakistan could play into the hands of political extremists "it looks like were watching a last act for musharraf but it could be a long last act " says teresita schaffer a former senior state department official who recently returned from pakistan many south asia experts believe the bush administration should be stepping up preparations for a post musharraf era a key step they say would be for washington to reach out to leading pakistani opposition figures such as former prime ministers benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif their secular political parties are expected to win the majority of seats in parliamentary elections expected this fall both ms bhutto and mr sharif from whom gen musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup are currently living in exile and face corruption charges back in pakistan ms bhutto hopes to return to pakistan later this year to help her pakistan peoples party take part in the parliamentary elections there is also speculation that she may cut a deal with gen musharraf that could allow the two to share power as prime minister and president but current and former u s officials say the white house has played no role in seeking to broker such a deal nor have there been any high level contacts with ms bhutto or mr sharif indeed many u s officials are skeptical that the former pakistani leaders can play much of a role in building up pakistans civil institutions and economy "what would benazirs return really do to advance things probably not much " says daniel markey who until february held the south asia portfolio in the state departments policy planning staff mr markey stresses though that pakistans return to civilian rule would likely increase islamabads political credibility the current political crisis has stoked rioting in a number of pakistani cities violence in karachi pakistans financial center left people dead last month there are also growing indications that the pakistani military has begun cracking down on the media and political dissent on friday the army outlawed political protests in islamabad the capital in the u s even democrats who have been highly critical of president bushs handling of foreign policy are nervous about what might happen if gen musharraf were to be forced out at a democratic presidential debate sunday night one questioner asked "how do you reconcile our security interests with pakistan with our interest in promoting liberal democracy " the partys front runner new york sen hillary rodham clinton acknowledged that gen musharraf "has solidified his rule and become quite antidemocratic " but she quickly added "at the same time we depend upon him to control the tribal areas out of which come the resurgent taliban and al qaeda fighters " a growing number of south asia experts both inside and outside the u s government however are challenging the idea that pakistan would fall apart without gen musharraf "in the past there was a sense that theres a seething mass of anti american masses " said mr markey the former state department official "what weve seen over time is that some things are wrong about this story they might not like the u s much but they dont want taliban rule" either gen musharraf is no stranger to crises al qaeda linked assassins made two attempts on his life in and foreign fighters and ethnic insurgents are at war with pakistans security forces in the countrys tribal areas and the resource rich province of baluchistan but they say the growing opposition from pakistans professional class poses a new kind of threat to the general as the political crisis has intensified the central intelligence agency and pentagon have held briefings with dozens of pakistan experts to discuss potential post musharraf scenarios according to participants but u s officials say such exercises are routine and dont indicate any expectations in washington that gen musharrafs time is running short members of pakistans top military command have visited washington in recent weeks including gen ehsan ul haq chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who is viewed as potentially playing a role in pakistans political transition but again administration officials described these visits as routine "last year there were a lot of discussions or what if meetings " about gen musharrafs future said a senior state department official "but musharraf is likely to be part of the post musharraf era hes a player in the transition and will likely lead it " as part of the transition many south asia watchers believe the u s government should seek to increase financial aid to pakistan outside military channels they note that historically washington has distributed twice as much assistance to pakistani military governments than civilian ones and they note that even today the majority of the u s governments aid to pakistan supports counterterrorism operations rather the programs aimed at alleviating poverty or strengthening civilian institutions "the u s embrace of pakistan only brings gains for pakistans military " says sherry rehman a member of parliament from the pakistan peoples party and president of the partys central policy planning office u s officials say the next six months will be crucial in determining gen musharrafs future he is seeking to win a new five year term as president from the current national parliament while continuing on as army chief of staff opposition parties led by ms bhuttos party argue that only a newly elected parliament can chose the next president and that gen musharraf would need to shed his uniform if elected u s officials are hoping pakistans military ruler can reach a political agreement with his political opponents that will allow them to share power in a new popularly elected government but the growing fear inside pakistan is that gen musharraf will either seek to force his re election through the current parliament or run an election that is widely viewed as rigged that scenario many pakistan analysts say runs the risk of stoking even more political upheaval and potentially leading the military to take an even more direct role in the country
