for jordanians shotgun weddings can be a problem activist invites revelers to leave weapons home the family kalashnikov madaba jordan its wedding season here florists are preparing bouquets bursting with white roses lilies and irises and in a noisy basement print shop a year old german made press pounds out thousands of invitations bearing entwined hearts and the message "gunfire is forbidden " the message is part of an unusual campaign in jordan where many people like to punctuate nuptials and other summer celebrations by aiming skyward and squeezing off a few rounds from assault rifles and handguns unfortunately because of misfires and the law of gravity the tradition transforms some weddings into funeral processions "you have to wear a helmet if you are going to go to a jordanian wedding " says ali zenat who runs a small social services agency here mr zenat is on a mission from his office with salmon colored walls and torn vinyl love seats the year old father of three is trying to get residents across the madaba district to forgo their long local tradition of celebratory gunfire earlier this year about a dozen people were wounded near here by an inebriated reveler with a gun mr zenat says at an infamous wedding outside the capital city of amman in two year olds were killed and several other people were wounded when a guest lost control of his machine gun many people in madaba city remember the infant killed in its mothers arms by a stray bullet in mr zenat who was educated in austria had his fill of such news three years ago he started a drive to stop the practice by persuading printers to put his "gunfire is forbidden" message on invitations for summer parties printers took to it immediately "i tell customers even if you dont like it leave it on the card then you can say you did your best " says farah nayef batarseh who runs madabas largest print shop mr batarseh estimates that his aging presses will pound out as many as invitations a day this summer bearing mr zenats message he says he doesnt even consult most customers about it in advance only a few ask for reprints "most people are happy someone is trying to stop it " mr batarseh says mr zenat also delivers bouquets to weddings throughout the district which is south of amman and abuts the dead sea in west central jordan each bouquet he says he has personally delivered more than arrives with a card that says "our wedding will be more beautiful without gunfire " sometimes he talks the local police into making deliveries with him he has papered the region with posters featuring a young woman who walked into a wedding and left as a paraplegic and he persuaded about of the districts most influential residents including the ranking members of big clans to sign a pledge to stop celebratory gunfire changing gun culture in the middle east is tough as one of the madaba districts most powerful tribal leaders sheik shibley khalid fawaz al fayez knows sitting one recent afternoon in the shade of the sheiks woolen bedouin tent mr zenat looked a bit out of place in a three button suit a french blue dress shirt and a thickly knotted necktie yet mr zenat listened carefully to the foot tall sheik who proudly displays the austrian made handgun he keeps slung in a shoulder holster beneath his flowing goldenrod cloak "its the same one king abdullah carries " mr al fayez said of his glock mm the sheik bemoans his inability to stop celebratory gunfire even at celebrations for his immediate family which includes daughters eight sons and two wives each summer members of his extended clan throw some of the districts most raucous parties on the grounds of his villas mr al fayez moves between the villas in a chauffeured cadillac escalade ext a vehicle feet high and weighing almost tons that appears to be not just a cadillac but a pickup truck and an suv for the same two minute ride one of mr al fayezs sons drives a hummer with leather upholstery and a russian made kalashnikov assault rifle under the front seat mr al fayez says that for a family wedding five years ago locals expected the skyward barrage from m assault rifles and kalashnikovs to be so intense that they advised the nearby airport to reroute flights at his own sons wedding last summer the sheik says he spent about &# on fireworks hoping that they would satisfy guests but it didnt work "imagine at my own sons wedding my brother shot my brother " says mr al fayez adding that it was just a minor wound a senior american diplomat attending the nuptials fled in fear according to mr al fayez who often asks distinguished guests to pose for pictures with his prized falcon "now its become a bad habit " mr al fayez said of years of celebratory fire "we have to bring it down slowly " changing attitudes over time is what mr zenat hopes to achieve even as he watches members of mr al fayezs clan and others openly carrying weapons "this is what we face " mr zenat says "in tribal society holding a gun is a sign of prestige " the seeds of this campaign were planted when mr zenat was a boy in one of his favorite older cousins mohammed zenat a jordanian track and field champion in the triple jump was shot at a prewedding party the bullet entered just above his left knee exited his inner thigh then struck the groom to be mohammed zenat remembers bagpipe music but little else "they had to cancel the wedding " he says he was in a coma for three months before waking to find most of his leg amputated "mohammed is a very distinguished man in our clan and to see him on crutches really had an impact " mr zenat recalls yet today even members of the zenat clan moan when they see ali zenat coming they know hell chide them at the weddings of other clans the reception can be tougher mr zenat says he encountered outright hostility last year at a celebration near the syrian border "they were shocked " he recalls "they thought we were going to ruin their wedding " before he had even driven yards away mr zenat heard the response to his plea gunfire mr zenat is not deterred he believes the local governor when he says that incidents are declining as the campaign helps build communal pressure "step by step were going to stop this " mr zenat says
