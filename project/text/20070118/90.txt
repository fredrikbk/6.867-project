put brakes on free trade fast track my friend and senate colleague max baucus suggests there may be a democratic consensus for once again ceding congressional authority over trade agreements to the president in effect renewing the trade strategy that the bush administration has pursued over the last five years "a democratic trade agenda " editorial page jan there is indeed a growing democratic consensus on trade but in the opposite direction many of the new senators campaigned on a platform of demanding trade agreements that are fair to our workers and our country that call for change has been coming for some time in the overwhelming majority of democrats opposed the passage of central american free trade agreement cafta which connected our economy with those of countries with a dismal record on labor rights such as guatemala and honduras and last year most democrats voted against the trade deal with oman a sultanate with a similarly appalling record of worker abuses these were the closest votes on trade issues in years there is a growing public sense that blind support for unfettered "free trade" in washington has cost our country dearly it just the past four years our already massive trade deficits have nearly doubled to well over &# billion a year and we have lost over three million manufacturing jobs so it is not a surprise that in the november election a number of new democratic senators ran winning races on a platform of changing the course on trade policy congress must reclaim its role in formulating trade policy the constitution gives congress not the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations we relinquish that authority to the president in the form of so called "fast track" trade authority at our peril i opposed granting such authority to president clinton and i opposed granting it to president bush in and so by the way did a majority congressional democrats the past five years of growing trade deficits have shown that our opposition to fast track and to unfair trade agreements was justified i believe in trade and plenty of it but trade agreements must stand up for our economic interests sen byron l dorgan d n d washington see related letter "letters to the editor antediluvian outlook" wsj jan
