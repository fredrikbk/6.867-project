deciding how to proceed none of the bidders is offering to pay a premium for all of tribune the type of offer the companys board and the chandler family were hoping to get when the company put itself on the auction block in september even so the board will likely come under pressure from shareholders to pursue some dramatic action the chandler familys offer is seen as a last ditch effort to rescue the value of its stake in the company under the proposal which hadnt been finalized the chandlers and private equity partners would buy the newspapers which include the los angeles times and chicago tribune while tribune would spin off its tv stations the familys advisers have received a commitment from one private equity firm for half of the money needed for the deal according to people familiar with the proposal but are trying to find additional investors the chandlers envision holding of the newspapers while partners would hold the remainder supermarket magnate mr burkle and real estate investor mr broad also submitted a proposal for tribune yesterday although it wasnt a buyout offer said people familiar with the situation the group proposed a leveraged recapitalization under which they would borrow roughly &# billion and offer tribune shareholders &# a share in a cash dividend that would leave shareholders with equity valued at &# a share the valuation of the proposal could vary depending on what value would be put on existing shares but the proposal says the offer is worth roughly &# a share the two men are also offering &# million in cash which would give them roughly of equity control of the company according to a person familiar with the proposal tribune would continue to trade publicly and because there would be no change of control the company would avoid the tax issues that would arise from a sale of individual assets it wasnt clear what the two men were proposing to do to improve the value and profitability of the company but a person familiar with their thinking said they didnt have immediate asset sales planned the offer from messrs burkle and broad would make the two men co chairmen of the company and they are proposing to keep current management

but the auction drew feeble expressions of interest from private equity firms concerned about the state of the newspaper industry the offer from the chandlers is still uncertain and will likely face opposition from tribune management which was drawn into a public dispute with the family last summer about the companys direction the chandlers offer wasnt expected to involve a significant premium to tribunes stock price which could doom its prospects some sign of tribune managements view about the auction came yesterday when the companys second biggest shareholder a charitable foundation
