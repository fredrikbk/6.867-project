iphone fans and foes clash online critics zero in on apples technology choices cingular partnership the day after apple inc launched its new iphone padmasree warrior motorola inc s chief technology officer wrote on her blog on motorolas corporate web site that she is a fan of apples creativity and that she liked the cellphones new look then ms warrior whose company is the largest u s cellphone maker began to find fault with the iphone saying it lacks "revolutionary or disruptive" technologies "as worshippers come out of the heady enthralling grandstand production called macworld the hype settles and reality sets in " she wrote following the largely positive response immediately after iphones announcement last week business rivals such as motorola and an array of other critics are starting to question some aspects of the product the main flaw cited initially by critics was the pricing for the phone which starts at &# with a two year service contract wall street loved the device in development for more than two years investors pushed apples shares up by &# or to &# on the announcement news on jan the iphone wont hit the market until june and few outside apple have even held it in their hands making much of the discussion theoretical at this point apple has seen it all before when apples ipod digital music player made its debut in people criticized the device for being unoriginal before it turned into a hit with consumers even so the iphone has become a popular topic detractors and fans are going toe to toe on online forums much of the latest criticism is zooming in on apples choice of technologies to use with the new phone and its decision to partner exclusively with at&amp t inc s cingular wireless which is being rebranded as at&amp t for example the iphone wont use the fastest wireless internet connection available relying on so called second generation or g rather than faster g networks now being rolled out by major wireless carriers because of this industry experts expect features of the iphone such as web browsing and downloading not to be very fast tim cook apples chief operating officer said during a conference call with analysts yesterday the company is sold on cingulars g edge network because "its much more widespread and widely deployed in the u s " mr cook didnt comment on whether apple will eventually support g but said "obviously we would be where the technology is over time " some people refer to edge as g slow downloading speeds could affect other built in iphone features such as google map and yahoo mail applications critics have said adam sexton the chief marketing officer of groove mobile a start up that helps carriers such as sprint nextel corp a rival of apple partner at&amp t inc to run their mobile music services says that the network chosen by apple is too slow to accommodate some content services an apple spokeswoman said the company chose cingular because "its the best and the most popular carrier in the u s " with million customers cingular said it expects iphone users not to rely solely on its wireless network but also to use the device at wi fi hotspots short range wireless internet connections available at airports hotels and coffee shops and even some cities wi fi networks offer much faster connection than standard wireless networks and even g networks apples exclusive partnership with cingular as its u s service provider irks some customers of other carriers the iphone will be available to cingular customers only when they sign a new two year service contract cingular said it hopes the new handset will help it attract high end customers who are also willing to pay extra to access the internet and other entertainment content to be available on the iphone some bloggers said they are considering switching to cingular from their current carriers because of the iphone in a response to an iphone post on the widely read technology blog techcrunch a reader named ken rossi wrote "i might have to figure out a way to get out of it to get my number moved to cingular " cingular spokesman mark siegel said some of the negative comments regarding the iphone are "a transparent attempt by our competitors to undermine one of the most significant developments ever in the wireless industry " what will be missing from apples iphone in spite of its cooperation with cingular is media net cingulars wireless portal where phone users can browse the web and buy ringtones and games mr siegel declined to comment on what kind of features will eventually be available on the iphone regarding questions about whether iphone users will be able to download ringtones games or music over the air the apple spokeswoman said that the company hasnt announced that level of detail but iphone users will download music the same way they do on their ipod by buying music on a personal computer then synching it to the iphone the spokeswoman declined to comment on the posting by ms warrior on the motorola site ms warrior couldnt be reached for comment motorola has some experience dealing with apple motorolas rokr cellphone plays apples itunes music but it hasnt sold well and has been faulted by gadget watchers for its lack of memory capacity to store downloads a motorola spokeswoman said motorola will continue to make handsets with built in apple itunes application in response to iphones debut she said "we offer not just one phone not just one partner but an entire ecosystem of music offerings " amol sharma contributed to this article
