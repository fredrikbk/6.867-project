style tricks of the trade a salon owner washes his hair in his years in the salon business frederic fekkai has become almost as well known for his wavy locks as some of his a list clients the year old mr fekkai who owns four eponymous u s salons and has a high end line of hair and body care products says his secret to beautiful hair lies in his regular cleansing routine mr fekkai washes his hair every other day he believes it is unnecessary to shampoo every day unless you sweat a lot or your hair is prone to becoming greasy he avoids shampoos that contain alcohol which he says dries out hair and favors ones that contain naturally based ingredients such as olive oil and shea butter because "its very nourishing to the hair" and can soften it he also alternates between two shampoos one with a conditioner and one with a shine enhancer but without conditioner this changes up the ph balance of the hair he says and prevents it from looking dull when cleansing it is important to avoid using too much shampoo which will make it harder to rinse out says mr fekkai who only uses a quarter size dollop each time he suggests using a tablespoon if your hair is below the shoulder he gently works the shampoo through his hair for seconds occasionally using the balls of his fingers to gently massage the scalp and activate circulation "make sure you do not rub the scalp too much or youll irritate it " says mr fekkai who adds it potentially harms the roots of the hair and could result in breakage to rinse he runs his hair under water that is "as cold as you can stand" and uses a wide tooth comb to comb out the shampoo hot water will open the hair follicles he says and possibly trap some shampoo which could then make the hair look limp and greasy twice a week he uses either a hair masque with shea butter to soften his hair or soaks it in a vinegary rinse that he sometimes makes on his own the home made version involves mixing a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with oz of water and a quarter teaspoon of conditioner he pours it over his head massages it in for seconds and rinses it out with water and a comb "it gets rid of residue and impurities " he says when styling he avoids using hair products that make his hair "too stiff or hard" or have high alcohol contents which will dry out hair he says he tries to avoid using a hair dryer if he has to he only uses the dryer on "cold" or "warm" temperatures making sure to hold it five inches away from his head
