wall street firm also earned an estimated &# million in fees for advising the buyout group and its role in underwriting about &# billion in bank loans and junk bonds the fourth quarter results also are likely to include revenue for the buyout of rental car company hertz global holdings inc which went public in november at a price that gave merrill lynch an indicated profit of more than in a matter of months on a &# million investment the private equity buyouts in which investors acquire control of companies hoping to cash out at a profit through a stock offering or outright sale are part of a strong performance by merrills largest business global markets and investment banking they show the commitment of merrill chief executive officer stan oneal to ramping up risk and returns at merrill beyond private equity merrill acquired an &# million commodities business in paid &# billion for a mortgage business last fall and engineered a &# billion swap of merrills money management unit for a stake in bond manager blackrock inc the push reflects both mr oneals past as a banker who rose in the firms junk bond unit that finances buyouts like hcas as well as a trend throughout wall street to put more money into buyouts and other risky market bets all told merrills private equity bets top &# billion more than for any other major firm as a percentage of equity capital a firms cushion against losses however the shift has raised questions about whether merrill is taking too much risk and generating conflicts with clients after the hca deal was announced an hca investor sued merrill charging the firms bankers deprived hca holders of oversight to ensure they got a fair price by joining the buyout group the suit was settled at an investor conference in november one attendee asked mr oneal about the experience of j p morgan chase &amp co which made a series of new economy investments during the technology stock bubble but cut back when the profits turned to losses "how do you look at that from a risk perspective " he asked mr oneal responded that j p morgan had suffered from "investment drift" from classic debt financed buyouts of existing businesses into "business plans as opposed to real businesses" which would "only work if the environment is continuing to go in one direction " merrills strategy he said is focused on investing in existing businesses and partnering with other private equity firms where merrill brings in its own ideas while the strategy "enhances our financing franchise " he acknowledged "like most things its not without some risk " behind the moves is a performance gap merrill is trying to close in the years merrills annual return on equity a closely watched measure which compares profits to capital was and trailed the average of for its four principal competitors according to sanford c bernstein &amp co one reason bernstein says is merrill took less risk than rivals the difference has hurt merrills stock price up since december compared with an average of for the four rivals merrill directors recently tied some executive pay to increasing the firms roe and to help spur the private equity drive merrill recently instituted a program to pay bankers extra if one of their clients pursues a buyout that merrill participates in the current drive has helped merrills earnings in last years second quarter private equity profits accounted for an estimated &# million or of net revenue or revenue minus interest expense the gains accounted for an even greater percentage of pretax quarterly profits of &# billion gains in the third quarter were an estimated &# million merrills conflicts are easy to see at hca merrill historically had advised management and the board who work for shareholders in the buyout talks merrill advised a management led group trying to buy the company at a lower price in late may after merrill joined bain capital and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co in exploring a buyout the firms bankers gave hca directors a downbeat summary of hcas prospects as a public company stock market valuations were below normal there was "no clear catalyst" for improvement in analysts views and there werent any acquisition prospects big enough to "move the needle " as a result the merrill bankers said "timing is optimal" to explore a buyout charles corry a former ceo of usx corp who owned hca shares joined lawsuits to block the deal saying the sale process was unfair to shareholders because merrill shifted from advising the company to working with the buyers he said merrills "role reversal has elements of a conflict of interest " first merrill was supposed to "enhance shareholder value " then it tried to acquire the company "at the lowest possible price " he said the lawsuits were settled merrill denies that its bankers advice to hca was influenced by merrills own interest in joining the buyout group gregory fleming co head of merrills institutional securities division says "we always put our clients interests ahead of ours " mr oneal doesnt dispute the conflicts exist "the question is not whether there is a conflict the question is how do we manage that conflict " he says in fact merrill recently hired a lawyer from goldman sachs group marcus colwell to manage business selection and conflicts in both trading and investment banking although mr oneal began as a junk bond banker at merrill in by the time he took charge of the firms member leveraged finance unit in april the junk bond market had nose dived the firm exited private equity and other illiquid investments in to conserve capital after losses in just before he took over as ceo mr oneal decided merrill would re enter the business in september merrill put up &# million toward a &# billion buyout with two private equity firms of debenhams plc a british department store chain which set the pattern for merrills later deals merrill helped arrange two loans to the company as the buyout sponsors took out dividends allowing merrill to report gains on the deal including &# million in the second quarter of that amounted to of merrills pretax net debenhamss return to public ownership in may aided merrills second quarter private equity gains as well merrill was also an underwriter of the ipo in september merrill agreed to put up &# million for a buyout with two other sponsors valued at &# billion counting debt of car rental company hertz like debenhams hertz is quickly generating profits hertz paid a dividend valued at &# million to merrill in june and another &# million from its initial public offering in november the ipo left merrill with a stake valued at &# billion more than doubling the value of merrills investment in just months at hca mr oneal personally assured ceo jack o bovender jr that merrill was serious about getting back into the private equity game at one point calling mr bovender on his cellphone to assure him that merrill was willing to write a big check to make it happen counting debt the hca buyout totaled a record &# billion merrills mr fleming says merrill bankers perform "risk mitigation" and "catastrophe scenario" analyses last year mr oneal years old personally spiked a proposal to invest in a japanese condo developer questioning whether merrill had the needed expertise merrills re entry into the private equity deal business has also rankled some buyout executives who dont like the extra competition as mr fleming acknowledges "youre taking somebodys seat at the table " but he says competing with buyout clients shouldnt be a problem as long as merrill bankers can offer them more deal opportunities than merrill takes away as a buyout investor henny sender contributed to this article
