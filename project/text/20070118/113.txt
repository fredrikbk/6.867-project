the expat life facing the fears and facts of living with pollution rebecca and i first visited beijing almost two years ago spending eight days here while trying to decide whether or not to move about halfway through the skies became hazy and the air began to smell a bit the "fog" grew and grew and a day or two later we couldnt see the high rise construction project outside our hotel room window "its good that youre seeing this " said our guide "the pollutions not like this all the time but it does happen regularly and you should know that as you make your decision " obviously it didnt dissuade us from coming and it wasnt really much more than a speed bump in our decision making process there have been times however when ive wondered if that lack of attention was foolish those thick hazy days do occur regularly and we all fret about them flying into beijing you can often see a haze hovering above the city which is surrounded by mountains on three sides even on clear days there is often a heavy odor in the air especially on winter mornings when you walk outside and smell fire presumably from all the coal burning heaters many people complain of a "beijing cough" or upper respiratory infections that linger for weeks somewhat frighteningly you get used to all this but every once in a while something happens that really makes you wonder one morning eli looked outside and said "aw todays not going to be any fun its foggy so we cant play outside " the school keeps kids indoors on particularly bad days the first eight months we lived here it never rained then the skies opened and there was hour downpour that evoked thoughts of noah when the sun finally came out it felt like a rebirth everything looked and smelled better the city had taken a shower and a heavy layer of grime had been washed away even the sky sparkled i looked out a third floor window and stared dumbfounded at mountains gleaming on the horizon were they always there but i just never looked out the window i erased any such doubts shortly when we went out for dinner and turned down a road i often travel for the first time it looked like i was on a beautiful country lane a sunset painted sky reflected off of mountains to the north and west the vista was shocking but i was more shaken in the months that followed when i couldnt see the mountains even on crisp clear blue sky days we had a couple of really atrocious pollution days in december in the midst of one someone told me that a friend of a friend had a chest examination which revealed damaged lungs "living here is like smoking a pack of cigarettes a day you know " she said i had my doubts about this oft heard legend but my father in law is a radiologist and i requested chest x rays when we visited michigan the good news they looked perfectly normal the bad news they likely would have been the same even if we actually had started smoking a pack a day months ago cumulative damage is the issue and there certainly is reason to worry at a december environmental conference in indonesia the asian development bank released statistics showing that beijing has the dirtiest air of major asian cities without even attempting to break down the scientific measurements there is a scale on which the world health organization puts the safe level at and beijing averages seeking more information i paid a visit to the beijing environmental protection bureau where i met with deputy director du shaozhon just inside the doors of the building a large flat screen tv displays the current pollution readings for each of beijings districts even on a crisp blue day the rating for the city as a whole was in the range of four to five times above the who safe levels upstairs mr du and his colleagues explained a lot of the issues facing the citys air i was there for hours but everything i learned boiled down to "weve come a long way but we have a long way to go " while they have made significant advances in reducing the amount of coal being burned and phasing out older incredibly polluting cars and factories there is more of everything in an economy growing at some a year most crucially beijing adds cars a day wanting to make sure that mr du wasnt spinning me too hard i contacted a foreign expert on beijing pollution who asked not to be named i was braced for the worst she agreed that the situation had improved but was still quite bad and while not exactly reassuring didnt really sound any new alarm bells "when it looks really bad outside " she said "its really bad " and what about the pack of cigarettes thing if its possible to hear someone roll their eyes i did so when i asked this question "thats a persistent urban legend which started in new york in the s and keeps moving around " she said "ambient air pollution is not good for you but it cant compare to cigarette smoking where you are directly injecting the bad stuff into your lungs " she also made the point that air pollution here is no worse than it was in the u s or europe to years ago "air pollution is a real problem here and i dont want to minimize it i just think its a disproportionate expat concern compared to all the other risks they take every day " she was talking primarily about driving that is certainly a good point but it didnt make me feel any better we dont drive as often we breathe but we do so often another point that she and others i spoke to made was that our privileged lifestyle shields us from most of the worst effects of the pollution we arent doing manual labor outside or living and working in street level dwellings or poorly ventilated homes heated by wood burning stoves but we are living here and i do worry about what it means for the kids to that end i contacted their pediatrician dr alan mease of beijing united hospital our conversation left me feeling marginally optimistic or at least not horribly pessimistic i noted that our kids have actually been unusually healthy since we arrived here and said i was thankful that they didnt have any asthmatic conditions those that do must really struggle "some do worse and some do better " he said did you say some do better "yes " he said "its very dry here and that is beneficial to people with certain respiratory problems " but overall all this pollution cant be good for kids right "there have been a lot of studies about pediatric response to air pollution and they suggest that are some negative effects that can only be measured after a period of to years " dr mease said "the real question is long term we just dont know what the effects will be when these kids are or " that is a scary thought but i reserve most of my worry for the chinese who will live and die here most of them dont have an out our stay will be relatively brief in a few years well be gone back to the nice clean country air of metro new york do you live someplace with particularly bad pollution or other environmental problems have you in the past have such issues affected your decisions about where to live im looking forward to hearing from you share your thoughts readers respond write to me and ill post selected comments in a future column please let me know if you want to share your thoughts but dont want your letter published below are selected edited responses to my previous expat life column about the perils of transpacific travel with children you ask pity for yourself while knowingly subjecting fellow fare paying passengers to hours of torture from your children to avoid future travel travails stay home c jon johnson with all due respect i dont think i asked for pity and my kids are actually quite well behaved for the most part we are the only ones who have to deal with them they dont scream tantrum or do anything else particularly disruptive the gentleman next to my son did have it a bit rough this last flight but that was just a few moments out of a hour flight furthermore there were some empty seats on the plane and both the flight attendant and i offered to help him move at the start of the flight and he declined for god knows what reason i laughed out loud at the image of you unscrewing your head and storing it in the luggage compartment having made that flight last summer i understand the sentiment i did not have kids with me but will forever be more patient when those around me are screaming into my ear iris berdrow i lived in hk beijing for + years and miss it still im unmarried and childless and i confess that i sat through many many hour flights silently raging at wailing kicking crying fellow passengers typically but not always children after watching my sister brother in law navigate young parenthood and reading pieces like your column though ive gained a real appreciation for both the in flight battles of parents and the availability for me of melatonin and earplugs i promise that next time i fly to asia ill plug in and pass out until i have kids anyway katherine liu we lived in asia for years to prepare for our home leaves every two years lasting about a month i found small toys books and games for our two children wrapped them as gifts and whenever a melt down occurred id fish out another "trip surprise" the quantities of surprises diminished and the outlays increased as the children grew older they were great travelers i always calculated that the first week stateside was for them to adjust to the time change the second week for me thats just the way it is helen hughes the trip surprises are a good idea we did that initially but have ceased and im not sure why we are going home more than you did twice a year at this point our kids are also great travelers for the most part i have two words for you "business class " i have done two foreign assignments mumbai mths and singapore years and commuted between ny and la for over two years every week j class or the upgrade to first was the only way even air india miraculously becomes enjoyable in j cathay and singapore well i am sure you have experienced it robert i have never been on cathay or singapore airlines but hope to be before too long the front of the plane is simply not in the cards at this time and talk about my kids annoying fellow passengers write to alan paul at expatlife dowjones com
