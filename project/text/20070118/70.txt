middle seat mailbox travelers blast airlines for lost bags would hefty penalties for lost luggage force air carriers to find a better way travelers have lots of questions about airline baggage handling but they all seem to boil down to the same thing isnt there a better way this weeks column on the hassle of lost luggage found a vocal audience of readers who had suffered lost bags themselves many wondered why airline customer service couldnt be better than a phone line with a minute wait and no answers or worse many questioned why airlines cant better track your bag some had questions about the headline on the story itself and on the terminology of airline baggage handling is a suitcase "lost" if it is delivered a day or two later some answers and suggestions offered by experienced travelers as always letters have been edited billy harvey "if we passed a law that would value all the persons belongings at a flat rate of &# on the spot if not delivered by the airline to the person holding the claim check at the gate on arrival then this silliness would stop " mike brickman agreed "if we legislate airlines to cover the replacement cost of lost or damaged luggage i think the problem will go away " a &# penalty may be extreme but many readers made the same point if the penalty was more severe without all the wiggle room that was pointed out in the article then the airlines would get better at baggage handling for now they dont invest in doing it better several readers noted that radio frequency id tags are cheap enough for wal mart to track inventory raising the question of why airlines cant invest in the technology "rfid technology would be a lot more affordable for airlines if airlines were more responsible for the actual value of what they lose on their customers behalf " said bryan chaffe mike young suggested that airlines could invest in the rfid reading and tracking technology and customers could buy their own tags that would uniquely identify their bags trip after trip just as they buy a device for their car on toll roads millard l humphreys suggested that customers would be willing to pay &# or &# more to check bags if they got an rfid tag that would greatly reduce loss henry pinkey and others reminded me of the best suggestion of all to avoid lost bags make sure you have your name and phone number on both the outside and the inside of the bag often bags are declared lost when tags on the outside are mutilated or torn off if theres nothing inside to identify the owner the airline cant return it "throw in a business card or two for good measure " mr pinkey suggested several readers said they now routinely ship their bags via fedex or united parcel service they get door to door service saving the time spent waiting at airport luggage carousels they get real tracking and email confirmations they dont lose items to thieves they can ship whatever they want and for business trips their companies or clients usually pick up the cost matt dupree "for vacations i stuff my giant bike box with clothes for the whole family along with my bike and ship it two day for business trips i ship a box to the destination for delivery the day of my arrival or a little earlier " some readers took aim at the fine print airlines use to limit liability several asked why alaska airlines wont compensate customers for luggage lost due to weather how does weather cause lost luggage the answer is that weather problems can cause all kinds of flight disruptions which can result in missed connections for your bags just as it can result in missed connections for yourself you may be able to run through the airport to get to a departing flight but your luggage wont move as swiftly sometimes in alaskas case bad weather in alaska might mean the next flight cant get a bag for several days still you can easily argue that if the airline can get you to the destination it should be responsible for getting your bags there too and weather problems can be a catch all excuse for airline woes thats why i mentioned it the column i thought people should know and i thought it was an example of airlines stretching to limit their responsibility another fine print problem which i didnt have room for in the column was noted by joshua tulgan he flew from moscow to new yorks kennedy airport claimed his bag took a cab to la guardia airport and flew on to cleveland us airways lost his bag trying to get it to cleveland then refused to pay any more than &# in warsaw convention liability since the trip originated in moscow domestic liability is &# per passenger "airlines resort to all sorts of logic to curtail liability " he said deborah chapin suggested that its cheaper to take clothes in a carry on bag and buy toothpaste shampoo cream etc at your destination and she had a complaint about the suggestion at some airlines that clothes be rented rather than replaced when baggage doesnt arrive in time for important meetings or events "id like to point out that the suggestion of renting clothes is sexist " she said "does the tuxedo shop rent out womens suits as well " probably not amanda deveaux noted that the language used by airlines in the baggage realm can be rather humorous a few years ago her luggage was lost on a trip to the bahamas the bags went to haiti instead "i was told by american that the bags would surely be on the next flight from haiti when the bags still hadnt arrived a day later american informed me that they had missed the flight were they in the bar had they wandered off how irresponsible of my luggage clearly not the fault of the airlines my luggage missed the flight love it " on the question of whether the luggage is actually "lost " several readers noted as airlines do that most "mishandled" luggage ultimately gets returned to its owner as the story noted one passenger out of every arrives these days without their checked luggage and most of the lost bags eventually get returned to me "lost" doesnt mean that the bag cant be ultimately found i think the terminology is correct your bag is lost if you dont have it and cant use it for your vacation or your business trip "lost" seems particularly appropriate when airlines cant tell you where the bag actually is and several readers suggested that the journal was playing fast and loose with language with the main headline why airlines keep losing your luggage h s wright iii said it was a tease since it explained reimbursement policies but not why airlines keep losing your luggage i agree the headline could have been far more specific but i do think the column included information about why airlines keep losing your luggage from staffing and equipment issues to the problems of scanning bar codes and the lack of rfid tags thats what the headline writer was referring to and the smaller second headline referred to the bulk of the column dealing with what happens when they do lose your luggage still i think we mishandled the headline it was a case of a missed connection perhaps caused by bad weather and a "lost" opportunity to do better but we do accept responsibility have a question about air travel or the airline industry write to me at middleseat wsj com
