why some divers want to work in nuclear reactors radiation is an issue and the pay isnt great mr pickarts burst suit david harner pulled on a fitted lycra outfit with thin tubes snaking around his body carrying cold water he attached pencil thin monitoring devices to his thighs biceps chest and back co workers helped him into a red rubber suit and a helmet attached to an oxygen line mr harner then lowered himself into a pool of warm water that had the faint distant blue glow of fuel rods "not everyone would want to jump in a nuclear reactor " mr harner says "its a definite breed " mr harner years old belongs to a small corps of men and women who make their living in the underwater world of nuclear power plants many first took up diving as a hobby then attended commercial diving school john paul johnston executive director of divers institute of technology in seattle says "the high tech guys" are drawn to nuclear diving rather than to other sorts of work like offshore oil rigs mr harner whose father worked at a michigan nuclear plant started diving in muddy rivers where he could see little then he was sent into the crystal clear water of a reactor there he says he was struck by how much he could see including the numbers on the fuel rods about eight feet beneath him mark white chose diving about years ago rather than follow his father into the ohio coal mines he thought mining was a dying industry and too dangerous "when youre years old and you can try something new and daring it catches your imagination " says mr white who dives and manages projects for underwater construction corp the largest nuclear diving company divers are in great demand these days power companies need them to maintain many of the worlds nuclear reactors theyre also called on to repair aging bridges and water tanks and oil companies need them to fix offshore platforms damaged by hurricane katrina that has done little to increase pay for nuclear divers who start at salaries of about &# a year experienced divers certified for specialized work can make close to &# offshore divers make still more but have to live on a ship for months at a time nuclear reactors range in size from feet to feet tall and feet to feet wide depending on the type of technology they are enclosed in steel reinforced concrete structures during operation boiling water reactors are partially filled with about gallons of water that circulates to cool the fuel and also turns into steam to power the turbine pressurized reactors hold gallons of water during operations when the reactor is shut down for refueling and maintenance the vessel and secondary pools also called the cavity are filled with more than gallons of water that further cools down the reactor and acts as a guard against radiation the nuclear divers measure assignments not only by the minute but by millirems a measure of radiation exposure diver michael pickart received about millirems during a project last fall inside an arkansas nuclear reactors cavity thats more than the average persons annual exposure to natural radiation millirems according to the nuclear energy institute an x ray delivers about millirems at the arkansas plant mr pickart replaced underwater stainless steel tubes in an underwater chair the former construction worker cut and threaded new cylinders he says he tries not to think about the risks "if you ever slipped out of the chair it could ruin your day " he says he hastens to add that plant workers would swiftly pull him to the surface by the cords attached to his suit divers aim to keep exposure below millirems a year the limit set by most power companies the government allows individual divers to be exposed to millirems a year when they near the maximum divers are barred from nuclear plants which typically pay better than other jobs do after his work in arkansas mr pickart got a mix of assignments on a november job in illinois he worked primarily in a less radioactive pool a dive is aborted at the first sign of trouble last year david klassen was forced to surface after a few minutes when dosimeters showed he was receiving too much radiation the year old former southern california scuba instructor had been working on a reactor dryer in morris ill which removes excess water from the steam that powers turbines mr klassen says he later learned that his dosimeters had malfunctioned the work "never lets you get too relaxed " he says the divers equipment is the product of improvisation and experimentation conventional wet suits which keep divers warm in cold water arent practical the water in a nuclear plant is too warm sometimes exceeding degrees fahrenheit instead nuclear divers wear a suit made of vulcanized rubber which keeps them dry to stay cool they wear so called cold suits like the one mr harner donned developed for space walks in the s including the special helmet the gear can weigh about pounds thats more than twice as heavy as the gear commonly worn by recreational divers before a project begins plant technicians measure radiation in the pool divers wear as many as a dozen dosimeters on their knees arms chest back feet and hands to track exposure on the refuel floor generally five stories up workers monitor the dives and follow the real time radiation readings on computers mr pickarts cold suit burst on a recent job dousing the dosimeters with water and causing them to short out his dive quickly ended "theres no way to monitor you " he says if the dosimeters fail "theyre not going to leave you down there to get cooked " the divers mostly in their s and s sometimes travel as a small team to plants as distant as taiwan and korea they live on daily room and board allowances of as little as &# and often share motel rooms to save money in the fall more than a dozen divers from underwater construction in essex conn bunked for one to three weeks at the wingate inn in joliet ill underwater construction has been working on nuclear plants since the s the divers were divided into groups of four to eight for projects at two nearby nuclear plants kyra richter recently quit underwater construction after three years to work in operations at a nuclear plant diving is "what i love to do but theres no future " she says adding that the dives would get harder as she gets older ms richter also says she was paid less and given less interesting assignments than male divers on one recent assignment she remained "on deck" holding divers safety cords for more than a week rather than diving michael pellini underwater constructions vice president and co owner acknowledges the industry can be rough for women the company has five women divers among its employees mr pellini says he had not heard about ms richters experiences "we want to make sure we are treating everyone equally " says mr pellini who himself started diving in daniel vollrath who is joined underwater construction last year after five years with the u s coast guard he chose inland diving over offshore diving because it means less time away from home more important he likes the weightless feeling of hovering in a reactor pool tethered by a "lifeline" of cords providing air communications and radiation readings it is he says "the closest thing to being an astronaut " corrections &amp amplifications divers who work in nuclear plants wear helmets attached to an air line a page one article last thursday said they are attached to an oxygen line wsj jan
