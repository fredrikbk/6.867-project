monets art as balletic inspiration monet impressions memorial hall chapel hill n c march and april raleigh n c only an eye but my god what an eye " so said cezanne about his contemporary and compatriot claude monet who stood as the leading light of paintings impressionist movement during the late th century the observation from the somewhat cerebral cezanne suggested that while visual splendors such as those radiating from just about any picture by monets deft hand were dazzling perhaps more than eye filling pleasure was wanted from the art of his time the relationship between the visual beauties of monets work and those of ballet were made plain last week in raleigh where the carolina ballet put on a double bill of premieres called "monet impressions " the four performance run was scheduled to coincide with the final weekend of "monet in normandy " a somewhat small and spotty exhibit at the north carolina museum of art further performances of the monet bill have since been added for the companys appearances at memorial hall in chapel hill n c march and april whatever ones thoughts about the new ballets and my own reactions follow the fact that a budding st century troupe could herald such influences as these without apology or tongue in cheek is a welcome sign the ballet world of late has been overrun where new works are concerned with choreography more concerned with twisting ballets classical formalities into a grungy grind than with the kinds of effects that would qualify as monet inspired robert weiss who has been the artistic director of carolina ballet since its founding in grew to maturity in the ground breaking new york city ballet during the companys last decades under the visionary george balanchine as mr weisss latest programming for carolina proves the lessons he learned under balanchine do not limit themselves to the great choreographers most experimental and austere modernist works which seem however misguidedly to prod todays ballet directors and choreographers in an aggressive and aggressively hard edged direction mr weisss monet program aimed unswervingly to celebrate the artist on his own visually lush terms broadway and ballet choreographer lynne taylor corbett found inspiration in "le dejeuner sur lherbe" monets study now in st petersburgs hermitage for his unrealized large scale answer to manets earlier work of the same name her character ballet to poulencs "sinfonietta" and other poulenc selections sets out to imagine the "lives" behind the seven men five women and little boy who take part in her picnic scene alas the often inventive and cleverly directed action of an outwardly festive parisian gathering characterized by currents and undercurrents of momentary flirtations and of lasting or lost love eventually becomes hard to follow trying to figure out whos who and whos surreptitiously yearning after whom within the programs sketchy list of characters becomes fatiguing it would take an antony tudor or a frederick ashton to name two great exponents of this type of emotive ballet to make ms taylor corbetts unspecified scenario come fully alive and breathe with drama and william ivey longs period costuming though pretty enough doesnt much help matters making the characters especially the women look more alike than individual yet "picnic" still manages to showcase carolinas cleanly schooled and unaffected dancers this is especially so in the case of attila bongar as claude and melissa podcasy as camille whose subtle gravity as the monets gives their somewhat vague roles an unmistakable focus and depth "the gardens at giverny " mr weisss ballet in six parts plus prologue and epilogue takes its cue mostly from monets later works primarily those painted within his private gardens in giverny while "picnic" explores incidents indicated by one of monets early paintings mr weisss "gardens" fixes on the atmosphere in various monet studies celebrating the beauties of sky water and flora the music of claude debussy and ernest chausson serves as the score for "gardens " with a separate composition accompanying each of the ballets eight parts mr weiss has identified his prologue as "the artist stares at a blank canvas " besides a male dancer cyrille de la barre representing the "artist" who somewhat confusingly will be replaced by others dancing this character as the ballet unfolds the central and leading dancers for this full company work are all women they are named after monets female subjects such as those depicted in "woman with a parasol" and "resting under the lilacs " as well as after the flowers the artist tirelessly painted iris water lily and rose david heuvels costumes are appropriately light and thoughtfully suited to expansive solo and intricately partnered dancing though sometimes unbecomingly cut ms podcasys water lily tunic looks lackluster above her bare legs three male dancers in supporting roles as "the water" seem lost in long dirndl skirts and boxy blouses mr weisss program note says that initially he thought of monets water lilies as "upside down ballerinas in tutus " starchy tutus might have added some artful variety now missing in "gardens " jeff a r joness paint stroke backdrops and ross kolmans variegated lighting work handsomely together but at times lack the vibrancy associated with the monet brushwork and color schemes evidently inspiring them the ballets minutes feel longer than they might have seemed had the music been more compelling or if mr weisss choreography and direction were more inventive and less repetitive perhaps if the choreographer had chosen to present not only a svelte young monet but also eventually an aged one in bushy beard thick boots and weather beaten hat the encroaching monotony might have been allayed nevertheless individual dancers such as hong yang as the shimmering ballerina dominating the "clouds" section and timour bourtasenkov as a sensual narcissus like figure among the "waterlilies" made their marks as mr weisss choreography made its way to his effective long awaited finale if paraphrasing cezanne it were suggested that this program was "only a feast for the eye " one would have to add "but my god what a pleasure that is in this day and age " mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
