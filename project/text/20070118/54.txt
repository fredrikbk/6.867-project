how the vast capital pool fuels bids for equity office vornado realty trusts bid to top blackstone groups &# billion offer for equity office properties trust depends heavily on the ability of the vornado consortium which includes starwood capital group global llc and walton street capital to raise financing for a deal that will include about &# billion in debt while lenders are eager to back deals many of the usual suspects are already aligned with blackstones bid including goldman sachs group inc citigroup inc and bank of america corp j p morgan chase &amp co is the only heavyweight not involved in the blackstone bid the board of equity office properties has barred blackstone from asking any of the eight members of its powerful lending group to refrain from financing a rival bid but many participants in the group of banks say privately that they would be reluctant to simultaneously back a competing offer regardless that is a reflection of just how important private equity firms have become for wall street blackstone for example doles out more than &# billion every year in fees to wall street private equity firms routinely try to discourage competing bids by tying up as many banks as they can in the past such attempts were destined to fail because the amounts of money were relatively small and the number of possible lenders large with a deal as large as equity office though many analysts thought it would be difficult for a competing bidder to cobble together credible financing in another indication of just how much money is around the doubters appear to be wrong j p morgan which traditionally has been very close to blackstone is expected to take a lead role in financing the vornado bid a j p morgan spokesman declined to comment lehman brothers holdings inc a longtime adviser to vornado is also part of the financing group and there are enough foreign banks such as ubs ag and barclays capital plc and royal bank of scotland to which the vornado group is turning thats important because unless the group can convince equity offices board that it has the wherewithal to buy the company it will be unable to examine equity offices books and do due diligence moreover in putting together the financing the vornado led group did not turn only to banks the group also discussed possible financing arrangements with nontraditional sources of finance most notably hedge fund cerberus capital management ultimately though the group decided to go with the banks according to people familiar with the matter cerberus declined to comment cerberus had considered bidding for eop itself but ultimately decided it had more interest in offering financing to a competing bidder rather than becoming the owner of the largest office building company in the u s according its chief operating officer mark neporent that it has the choice of providing either equity or debt depending on its calculation of where the greatest return lies is testimony to how nimble and flexible cerberus is cerberuss pockets are deep with about &# billion under management and it has a network of investors in its own funds that would be likely to invest alongside any potential financing transaction while the vornado group declined cerberuss offer hedge funds are eager to do more of the private equity deal financing business unlike wall street firms hedge funds such as cerberus highland capital management lp or silver point capital lp arent under the sway of private equity firms a few years ago the top fee payers to wall street were mostly industrial conglomerates now private equity firms dominate the list the relative independence of the hedge funds could give them an opening especially in a bidding war also working in the vornado groups favor is the fact that recent real estate deals havent involved much equity for example analysts say that when harry macklowe of macklowe properties inc purchased the trophy gm building in the fall of for &# billion the equity amounted to only a small part of the total price that means even a group that isnt particularly well heeled could borrow money for the equity with the understanding that other groups would be offered a chunk of the equity or that before the deal closed buildings could be sold to repay such a so called bridge loan
