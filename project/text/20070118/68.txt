memo to chinas hordes of cyclists lighten up olympics bmx events will show the dubious how bikes can be fun china has long been known as a land of bicycles even with the advent of cars the streets of many cities are filled with people riding them but to many if not most of the cyclists the bike is transportation a tool for getting from here to there rather than a source of healthful exercise or fun now that is beginning to change and may change even more when next years olympic games get under way in beijing at least that is what cycling enthusiasts the organizers of the olympics and makers of sports bikes are hoping for along with bicycle track racing the organizers are trying to raise interest in the sport by adding a bicycle motocross bmx event using modified bicycles bmx riders will race along a dirt track of jumps and banked corners in the olympics the addition of bmx racing follows a series of new events meant to appeal to the generation x crowd which consider many of the traditional olympic events to be boring beach volleyball snowboarding cross country mountain biking and the triathlon have all been added to the roster since the atlanta games in "the olympic committee has been under a lot of pressure to modernize the olympic program " says johan lindstrom the technical delegate from the international cycling union the nonprofit umbrella organization for national cycling federations that is coordinating the event for "snowboard cross was very successful in the winter olympics " he says "now hopefully bmx racing will be the first to have the same success in the summer olympics " tang mingxi sales manager at one of chinas largest bicycle manufacturers shenzhen xidesheng bicycle is optimistic about bmxs future even though less than of the companys domestic sales are bmx bikes in the not too distant past mr tang says "you would never see people on the street using their bicycles for exercise but beginning last year you see it everywhere youll see the market for bmx and other specialized bicycles is going to grow when something is popular here it catches on quickly " while the olympics will only include racing the bikes are also used in freestyle bmx featuring tricks such as the bunny hop where the rider lifts the bike off the ground without help from a jump or the endo where the rider stops the front of the bike raising the rear wheel in the air bmx a sport homegrown by california teenagers in the s that has gained global popularity was first introduced to young riders in chinas southern provinces who had some limited exposure to it from riders in hong kong where it was popular in the s for more than a decade interest in the sport in china was limited to the small group of people who were exposed to it and had enough money to buy modified bmx bicycles which have inch wheels and handlebars that can turn degrees since the international olympic committee decided in to replace two track races with bmx racing in the games competitions have been televised throughout china "i think more people will appreciate bmx as a sport and a passion after they see it in the olympics " says max chen the year old sports marketing coordinator for pacific cycle inc s mongoose brand in china and one of that nations veteran bmx freestyle riders pacific cycle owned by consumer products company dorel industries inc has just recently begun to sell the mongoose bikes in china but has signed up to sponsor four of chinas top bmx freestyle riders the company will also provide mongoose race bikes and gear to the national bmx race team which will compete in the olympics "the number of active riders is small less than of the population but rapidly growing market opportunity is strong " says mo moorman spokesman for pacific cycle the sport also easily attracts young potential athletes mr chen still remembers the day years ago when he saw his first bmx freestyle performance on the grounds of his school "i saw them doing flips flying off of jump boxes and i thought wow you can do that with a bike id never seen anything like it i was really amazed " two years later he bought a secondhand bmx bike from a local store where he said the storekeepers didnt know what they were selling he started gradually by just following a group of riders around all of whom were older than he was he watched as they jumped and did various tricks and borrowed the precious magazines they somehow got from overseas which were tattered from being passed around from rider to rider "we read and reread those magazines " says mr chen who today travels throughout china giving performances and competing in freestyle competitions he says he wont try out for the olympic team because he prefers freestyle over racing mr lindstrom says chinas bmx riders have improved over the past year increasing their international rank from the s to within the top spots so far this year only men and women world wide will qualify to compete in beijing in with the u s france switzerland and australia likely to dominate the top slots for entrants from chinas performance so far this year mr lindstrom says the country may have a chance to qualify especially in the womens event the olympic bmx track is expected to be built by june of this year mr lindstrom says the track will be more elaborate than most which he says will "push the limit for elite riders" with bigger jumps and higher speeds the event will have three rounds of quarterfinals three rounds of semifinals and one final round for about a two hour program much shorter than current bmx races which often take several hours with hundreds of participants if the program is successful mr lindstrom says he hopes it will make way for more awareness world wide of bmx jeffrey sheu spokesman for taiwanese bicycle manufacturer giant manufacturing co says "theres a definite market" for bmx in china his company began selling bmx bikes to the chinese years ago following a craze for the sport in the u s and japan but sales of the bmx bikes have remained a tiny share of the companys overall sales in china will that tiny share mushroom "thats hard to say " says mr sheu but he adds "the olympics will definitely spur some more interest in it "
