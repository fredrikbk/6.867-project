gates in afghanistan open to troop boost bagram afghanistan senior american military commanders have asked the pentagon for more u s troops to combat taliban forces and are finding the new defense secretary receptive to their request it is the latest sign that the old orthodoxy of more troops breeding dependency on u s forces is out freeing commanders to ask for more soldiers "clearly if the people who are leading the struggle believe there is a need for some additional help i am going to be very sympathetic " defense secretary robert gates said on a visit here yesterday "there is no reason to sit back and let the taliban regroup and threaten the progress that has been made here " former defense secretary donald rumsfeld was adamant that increases in u s troop levels slowed the development of afghan and iraqi army forces and made the two countries more dependent on u s troops his belief led many u s commanders to conclude that asking mr rumsfeld for more troops was pointless mr gates has staked out a very different position in his first month on the job the request for more forces is likely to be modest compared with the new troops headed to iraq but it comes on the heels of a request by u s commanders for as much as &# billion in new aid to afghanistan more than twice the amount it received in and highlights commanders concern that increasingly aggressive taliban fighters are undermining the afghan government there currently are about u s troops the highest level since the war began and about north atlantic treaty organization troops in afghanistan despite the large u s and nato force attacks by the taliban in the past four months have increased threefold along the afghan border region with pakistan mr gates declined to speculate how many troops the u s might send saying the number will be reviewed in washington "i think we have to look at what the impact is if we were to add more forces " he said the ability of the badly strained u s army and marine corps to find forces that arent already earmarked for iraq and afghanistan missions will also determine the size of the increase in afghanistan mr gates said senior military officers have moved quickly to embrace mr gatess philosophy regarding troop increases gen peter pace chairman of the u s joint chiefs of staff often seemed to share mr rumsfelds opinion that a troop increase would breed dependency on u s forces but yesterday gen pace backed his new boss he said a short term increase in u s forces if successful could reduce levels of violence speed the development of afghan forces and hasten the u s s ability to reduce forces over the long term "with a short term plus up you can have a success that will make it so you have less stress on the forces for a longer period of time " gen pace said it is unlikely that the u s would increase the size of the force in afghanistan by even a full brigade which consists of about troops lt gen karl eikenberry the senior u s general in afghanistan told reporters earlier this week that even a small increase in the size of the force in afghanistan could pay big dividends president bush would have to approve any increase mr gates said he would also push nato to deliver about troops that had been promised by alliance countries but had yet to show up in afghanistan see related letter "letters to the editor rumsfeld fulfilled generals requests" wsj january
