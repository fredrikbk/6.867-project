a paygo history lesson promising to bring new ideas and a fresh commitment to fiscal discipline house democrats launched their new majority by embracing pay as you go budgeting one of the worst fiscal management tools republicans ever invented "paygo" was first concocted by richard darman george h w bushs budget director as part of the budget deal that raised taxes in hopes of reining in the deficit that version just like the new house rule mandated that any change in taxes or entitlements resulting in revenue losses be offset with higher taxes or "cuts" in other entitlement spending with such a sensible sounding name who could be against paygo recent history has seen countless efforts to reform the budget process typically pernicious changes with deceptively reassuring titles the most infamous was lyndon johnsons "unified budget" who could support an un unified budget which allowed appropriators to get their hands on payroll tax surpluses dramatically expanding government spending later the serious sounding impoundment control act of allowed a democratic congress to strip the executive branch of its ability to rescind or defer spending authority from annual appropriations legislation today president bush has little choice but to veto an entire spending bill if he opposes even a single earmark a highly confrontational tactic he has chosen not to employ there are only two examples during my years in washington where the congress actually reduced domestic discretionary spending from the previous year the first was the gramm rudman hollings balanced budget act of grh which legislated hard deficit reduction targets and automatic spending sequesters to enforce them grh was so successful that congress amended it in easing the deficit targets to avoid additional spending reductions but grh continued to provide significant fiscal discipline until it was emasculated in domestic discretionary spending fell again with republican control of congress in the mid s we cut spending this time around by disciplining appropriators it was a clear commitment to fiscal restraint that allowed the gop leadership led by the house to keep spending under the targets established by the budget resolution for three consecutive years fy we cut outdated domestic programs sought efficiencies and forced appropriators to make tough choices between competing priorities over time that commitment to spending discipline was replaced by a commitment to get re elected at any cost and new spending records were set the democrats now in charge have promised to quote nancy pelosi "no new deficit spending no new bridges to nowhere " but deficit spending is caused by too much spending and under the house democrats paygo rule entitlement spending the lions share of the federal budget will grow unabated as will the massive unfunded liabilities of medicare and social security currently approaching &# trillion which are not acknowledged under existing budgeting practices meanwhile there are no enforceable caps on domestic discretionary spending and thus earmarks even if restrained as promised will do next to nothing to promote deficit reduction social security reforms that turn empty promises into personally owned accounts real assets for retirement cannot be funded under paygo without massive tax increases or deep reductions in promised benefits in effect paygo makes serious entitlement reform politically impossible without a word of debate meanwhile as surplus payroll tax dollars currently diverted into other spending programs continue to disappear the pressure on the deficit will become insurmountable while paygo might restrain democrat promises to further expand prescription drug benefits under medicare part d its most certain outcome will be massive tax increases unlike "mandatory" spending that grows on autopilot the various bush tax cuts are set to expire democrats already inclined to oppose lower taxes will be hard pressed to find other new tax revenue or spending offsets from cherished entitlements that would allow for making the tax provisions permanent two important factors created the budget surpluses of the late s spending restraint and robust economic growth bill clintons enormous tax increase generated less than half of the promised new revenue by but cuts in the capital gains tax and death tax helped make up the difference more importantly technological innovation and higher economic growth generated new revenues these new dollars coupled with spending discipline balanced the budget and paid down a substantial portion of the debt pay as you go has a different history at mr darmans urging george h w bush broke his famous campaign promise and signed on to a deficit reduction package that increased taxes and instituted paygo the economy tanked the deficit ballooned and the gop suffered an electoral rout in maybe theres a history lesson in there somewhere mr armey house majority leader from to is chairman of freedomworks
