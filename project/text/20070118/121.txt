vista worthy largely unexciting xp successor doesnt break new ground on ease of use but its best windows yet a new version of microsoft windows the worlds most popular and important computer operating system will finally arrive for consumers on jan it has taken the giant software maker more than five years to replace windows xp with this new version called windows vista an eternity by computer industry reckoning many of the boldest plans for vista were discarded in that lengthy process and whats left is a worthy but largely unexciting product vista is much prettier than previous versions of windows its icons look better windows have translucent borders and items in the taskbar and in folders can display little previews of what they contain security is supposedly vastly better there are some new free included programs and fast universal search is now built in there are hundreds of other smaller improvements and additions throughout the system including parental controls and even a slicker version of solitaire after months of testing vista on multiple computers new and old i believe it is the best version of windows that microsoft has produced however while navigation has been improved vista isnt a breakthrough in ease of use overall it works pretty much the same way as windows xp windows hasnt been given nearly as radical an overhaul as microsoft just applied to its other big product office nearly all of the major visible new features in vista are already available in apples operating system called mac os x which came out in and received its last major upgrade in and apple is about to leap ahead again with a new version of os x called leopard due this spring there are some big downsides to this new version of windows to get the full benefits of vista especially the new look and user interface which is called aero you will need a hefty new computer or a hefty one that you purchased fairly recently the vast majority of existing windows pcs wont be able to use all of vistas features without major hardware upgrades they will be able to run only a stripped down version and even then may run very slowly in fact in my tests some elements of vista could be maddeningly slow even on new well configured computers also despite vistas claimed security improvements you will still have to run and keep updating security programs which can be annoying and burdensome microsoft has thrown in one such program free but you will have to buy at least one more that means that while vista has eased some of the burden on users imposed by the windows security crisis it will still force you to spend more time managing the computer than i believe people should have to devote heres a quick guide to the highlights of the new operating system versions and upgrading vista comes in six versions two of which are primarily aimed at consumers one called home premium is the one most consumers will want it contains the full aero interface and it includes the functionality of windows media center and windows tablet edition which have been discontinued as separate products home premium costs &# or &# if you are upgrading from an earlier version of windows it will come preloaded on most midrange and some high end consumer pcs the other main consumer edition of vista is the stripped down version called home basic it includes the improved security and search but leaves out the new aero interface and the media center and tablet functions it will be preloaded on low price pcs home basic will cost &# or &# for upgraders a third version called ultimate will wrap up everything in home premium with some additional features from the business versions of vista this is for power users and it is likely to be preloaded on high end pcs but some regular users may need vista ultimate if their companies have particular network configurations that make it impossible to connect to the company network from home with home basic or home premium vista ultimate will cost &# or &# as an upgrade even if you buy the home premium or ultimate editions vista will revert to the basic features if it detects that your machine is too wimpy to run the new user interface for most users who want vista i strongly recommend buying a new pc with the new operating system preloaded i wouldnt even consider trying to upgrade a computer older than months and even some of them may be unsuitable candidates microsoft offers a free downloadable upgrade advisor program that can tell you how ready your xp machine is its available at microsoft com windowsvista getready upgradeadvisor if you bought a pc in the past few months and it had a "vista capable" sticker on it it should be able to run at least home basic if it was labeled "premium ready " it should be able to handle premium and probably ultimate microsoft says that home basic can run on a pc with half a gigabyte of memory and that premium and ultimate will work on a pc with one gigabyte of memory i strongly advise doubling those numbers to get all the features of vista you should have two gigabytes of memory far more than most people own even more important is your graphics card a component most people know little about home basic can run on almost any graphics system but premium and ultimate will need a powerful modern graphics system to run well performance i tested vista on three computers on a new top of the line hewlett packard laptop with vista preinstalled it worked smoothly and quickly it was a pleasure on a three year old h p desktop a vista upgrade installed itself fine but even though this computer had a full gigabyte of memory and what was once a high end graphics card vista ultimate reverted to the basic user interface and even then it ran so slowly and unsteadily as to make the pc essentially unusable the third machine was a new small dell xps m laptop in general vista ran smoothly and well on this dell but some operations were annoyingly slow including creating a new message in the built in windows mail program this surprised me because the dell had two gigabytes of memory and a fast processor security microsoft says vista is much more secure than any other operating system but this is hard to prove especially at the beginning of its life when few hackers and malefactors have access to it one visible security feature asks for your permission before you do potentially dangerous tasks like installing new software this is a good thing and its been on the macintosh for years but unlike the mac version the vista version of this permission feature doesnt necessarily require you to type in a password so a stranger or a child using your pc could grant permission for something you yourself might not allow vista also has built in parental controls so you can restrict what a child can do on the computer this is also already on the macintosh though the vista controls are more elaborate microsoft includes a free antispyware program in vista called windows defender but pc magazine regards it as inferior to paid programs like spy sweeper and spy doctor so you may want to buy one of these you should also buy an antivirus program which isnt included user interface the new aero interface is lovely and it makes using a pc more pleasant and efficient it apes some elements on the macintosh but retains a distinct look and feel icons of folders look three dimensional and they pop most file icons are thumbnails that show a tiny preview of the underlying document the old hourglass icon that appeared during delays has been replaced by a gleaming spinning blue circle the cutesy names for standard folders like "my pictures " have been changed to simpler ones like "pictures " as on the mac you can now drag favorite folders into a list at the left of open windows so its easy to get to them a new feature called flip d shows a d view of all the programs youre running and lets you scroll through them its like the macs excellent expose feature though not quite as handy another new feature called the sidebar is a vertical strip at the side of the screen that can contain tiny programs called gadgets displaying things like favorite photos news headlines stock prices and the weather once again this is awfully similar to a macintosh feature called dashboard which displays tiny programs called widgets some familiar windows features have new names the old display control panel where you chose screen savers and desktop pictures is now called personalization the add or remove programs control panel is now called programs and features search like the mac windows now has rapid universal built in search a very welcome thing the main search box is contained at the bottom of the start menu and it works well other search boxes appear in every open window you can also save searches as virtual folders which will keep collecting files that meet your search criteria this is another feature introduced earlier by apple built in programs the outlook express email program has been given a face lift and renamed windows mail but its pretty much the same except for a new junk mail filter the windows address book has been renamed windows contacts and oddly turned into a sort of file folder the latest version of the internet explorer web browser with tabbed browsing is included though its also available for windows xp as on the mac windows now has a nice centralized calendar program and theres a new photo organizing program windows photo gallery but its inferior to apples iphoto because it doesnt allow you to create photo books or add music to slide shows theres also a pretty rudimentary dvd burning program the familiar wordpad program can no longer open microsoft word files ironically apples free built in word processor does gradually all windows computers will be vista computers and thats a good thing if only for security reasons but you may want to keep your older windows xp box around awhile longer until you can afford new hardware that can handle vista email me at mossberg wsj com
