will al gore melt al gore is traveling around the world telling us how we must fundamentally change our civilization due to the threat of global warming today he is in denmark to disseminate this message but if we are to embark on the costliest political project ever maybe we should make sure it rests on solid ground it should be based on the best facts not just the convenient ones this was the background for the biggest danish newspaper jyllands posten to set up an investigative interview with mr gore and for this the paper thought it would be obvious to team up with bjorn lomborg author of "the skeptical environmentalist " who has provided one of the clearest counterpoints to mr gores tune the interview had been scheduled for months mr gores agent yesterday thought gore meets lomborg would be great yet an hour later he came back to tell us that bjorn lomborg should be excluded from the interview because hes been very critical of mr gores message about global warming and has questioned mr gores evenhandedness according to the agent mr gore only wanted to have questions about his book and documentary and only asked by a reporter these conditions were immediately accepted by jyllands posten yet an hour later we received an email from the agent saying that the interview was now cancelled what happened one can only speculate but if we are to follow mr gores suggestions of radically changing our way of life the costs are not trivial if we slowly change our greenhouse gas emissions over the coming century the u n actually estimates that we will live in a warmer but immensely richer world however the u n climate panel suggests that if we follow al gores path down toward an environmentally obsessed society it will have big consequences for the world not least its poor in the year mr gore will have left the average person poorer and thus less able to handle many of the problems we will face climate change or no climate change clearly we need to ask hard questions is mr gores world a worthwhile sacrifice but it seems that critical questions are out of the question it would have been great to ask him why he only talks about a sea level rise of feet in his movie he shows scary sequences of feet flooding florida san francisco new york holland calcutta beijing and shanghai but were realistic levels not dramatic enough the u n climate panel expects only a foot of sea level rise over this century moreover sea levels actually climbed that much over the past years does mr gore find it balanced to exaggerate the best scientific knowledge available by a factor of mr gore says that global warming will increase malaria and highlights nairobi as his key case according to him nairobi was founded right where it was too cold for malaria to occur however with global warming advancing he tells us that malaria is now appearing in the city yet this is quite contrary to the world health organizations finding today nairobi is considered free of malaria but in the s and s when temperatures were lower than today malaria epidemics occurred regularly mr gores is a convenient story but isnt it against the facts he considers antarctica the canary in the mine but again doesnt tell the full story he presents pictures from the of antarctica that is dramatically warming and ignores the that has largely cooled over the past years the u n panel estimates that antarctica will actually increase its snow mass this century similarly mr gore points to shrinking sea ice in the northern hemisphere but dont mention that sea ice in the southern hemisphere is increasing shouldnt we hear those facts mr gore talks about how the higher temperatures of global warming kill people he specifically mentions how the european heat wave of killed but he entirely leaves out how global warming also means less cold and saves lives moreover the avoided cold deaths far outweigh the number of heat deaths for the u k it is estimated that more will die from global warming but at the same time fewer will die of cold why does mr gore tell only one side of the story al gore is on a mission if he has his way we could end up choosing a future based on dubious claims that could cost us according to a u n estimate &# trillion over this century getting answers to hard questions is not an unreasonable expectation before we take his project seriously it is crucial that we make the right decisions posed by the challenge of global warming these are best achieved through open debate and we invite him to take the time to answer our questions we are ready to interview you any time mr gore and anywhere mr rose is culture editor of jyllands posten in copenhagen mr lomborg is a professor at the copenhagen business school see related letter "letters to the editor gore blows cold on warm debate" wsj january
