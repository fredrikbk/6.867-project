when celebrities get flak they call in this flack new york internist mitchell berger can always figure on having a certain number of patients in crisis nonetheless in the matter of emergency phone calls theres no contest the good doctors wife cindi has him licked "oh my god i get a ton more a ton more " said ms berger a partner at pmk hbh an entertainment public relations firm whose clients include rosie odonnell and the dixie chicks "my husbands specialty is oncology so overhearing his phone calls puts things into perspective for me hell overhear my phone calls and just roll his eyes " with good reason for the past several weeks ms berger has been fielding calls from the washington post the los angeles times the new york times the wire services and the "entertainment tonight" "access hollywood" axis all wanted interviews "no interviews " she said repeatedly she says that kind of thing a lot all wanted the latest word on the rosie odonnell donald trump donnybrook the battle was joined in late december on an installment of "the view " the abc talk show when ms odonnell waxed skeptical about mr trumps business savvy and his handling of the supposed substance abuse and emotional travails of the reigning miss u s a insult of insults she mocked the donalds celebrated do mr trump returned fire with some less than gallant observations about ms odonnells appearance and appeal and has continued to take aim during his most recent public appearances yes of course it was cindi to the rescue just as it was during ms odonnells court battle with the publisher of her now defunct magazine rosie but this was a particularly knotty situation ms berger also represents barbara walters rosies boss and co host willy nilly ms walters has been drawn into the imbroglio not always seeming to side with her sidekick "to handle both rosie and barbara oh yeah thats right up there " said ms berger who has a passing resemblance to actress julia louis dreyfus not a client "i will tell you its been a bad couple of weeks mother said thered be days like this she just never said thered be this many " in fact crises "i prefer to call them incidents" are nothing new to ms berger she was on the case in when then client mariah carey split from her music mogul husband tommy mottola on the case when subsequently mariah had a nervous breakdown "it was an emotional and physical breakdown " corrected ms berger "actually i prefer to call it a rough patch i was on the beach with my family when it all happened i drained four cellphone batteries two of my own one of my husbands and one of the friend we were with " more recently ms berger helped the dixie chicks paddle through rough waters after the groups lead singer natalie maines made a much publicized remark "just so you know " she told a concert audience in london just before the u s invasion of iraq "were ashamed the president of the united states is from texas " "i knew i needed a guaranteed magazine cover " recalled the very determined ms berger who nabbed time and entertainment weekly "then i wanted one television magazine show one syndicated radio show and that was it the questions would be asked and answered and we could move on thats how you do it " "she really delivers for her clients " said ellen levine editorial director for hearst magazines "but her word is golden with editors as well if cindi tells you shes going to do something she does it shes quite the straight shooter " through the years ms berger has learned that youve got only so much control "i think like in the case of barbara and rosie they both said what they needed to say but another party wasnt finished yet " she said pointedly "sometimes you have to just sit back and ride it out " experience has also taught ms berger that its just as hard and perhaps just as desirable to keep a clients name out of the paper as to get it in "my job is not just promotion and publicity " she said "theres also protection that you have to do its so not true that any publicity is good publicity you do publicity for a reason you do publicity for a purpose if theres a movie coming out or a tv show or a play or a book "there are some people out there who get their jollies seeing their name and face in the paper all the time and its the wrong approach you dont want the public to tire of you i give clients my suggestions and recommendations ultimately theyre going to agree or disagree but im in their lives for a reason " "shell tell you what things are and how things are shes got a real sense of clarity " observed ms bergers longtime client sharon stone "in the years that weve done business i have chosen not to take cindis advice three times and three times i have been mistaken her decision is the good decision " ms berger insists she is very clear about her role part friend part therapist part strategist and completely at ease with it "i have great relationships with my clients " she says of a roster that includes harry connick jr billy crystal jessica simpson and bette midler "but theres a line i never cross i dont get caught up in that world of celebrity i imagine there are some people who do but im not a hanger on and my clients know that ill walk the red carpet ill go to a premiere only if i have to i did all that it was great but now i want to go home to my kids " the youngest of three ms berger grew up in orangeburg n y she settled on a show biz career when as a college student she visited cannes during the film festival she refined her ambitions the summer after graduation when lolling in a friends swimming pool she read a story in cosmopolitan about celebrity publicists bingo hired almost years ago at pmk hbh then known as pickwick maslansky koenigsberg ms berger moved up through the ranks from receptionist to assistant to publicist to partner she now operates out of an airy office whose walls are lined with the trophies of the trade framed magazine cover photos of clients "to do well at this youve got to have the decisiveness to steer clients in the right direction " she said a good memory is crucial wait isnt she the reporter who did the hatchet job a strong stomach even more so "youre dealing with a lot of hysteria and drama " said ms berger who severed ties with clients susan sarandon and tyra banks when the drama and hysteria moved beyond acceptable limits "lets just say we had creative differences " she said the notion that one size fits all has no place in her business ms berger insisted every crisis er incident has its own trajectory and its own resolution still she allowed there are a few basic rules of engagement tell the truth "because the real story is always going to come out " do your homework because "you need to anticipate the questions your client is going to be asked " and uh oh remember no journalist is your friend "no journalist is your friend " she repeated meaningfully ms berger just returned from a weekend skiing getaway with her family where the blessed lack of cellphone reception more than made up for the lack of snow back at work shes making sure shes got a large supply of analgesics within reach "ive gone through a lot of advil in the last few weeks " and just recently she discovered the stress reducing power of stationary cycling classes "now " she said "my husband tells people that i spin recreationally and spin for a living " ms kaufman writes about the arts and culture for the journal
