the democratic field illinois senator barack obamas announcement this week that hes likely to enter the presidential race adds a dash of glamour and excitement to the democratic field but all of his media attention doesnt change the basic truth of the primary contest the race is between hillary rodham clinton and everybody else new yorks junior senator hasnt announced yet but her troops have long been massing ready to march on her orders and what a political machine it is starting with her husband who has made it clear he is aching for her to run psychoanalyzing the clintons is perilous but we suspect the former president doesnt like the way his years in office ended with impeachment the marc rich pardon and al gores failure to deliver a third symbolic term a victory for his wife would be a kind of political redemption for him too mrs clinton brings her own considerable strengths not least intelligence and self discipline she has performed far more smoothly in the senate than many observers expected and she hasnt been a polarizing figure in new york winning of the vote in november then there are those clinton legions of fund raisers union chiefs party bosses think tank operatives media consultants mrs clinton blew through more than &# million during her all but uncontested senate re election campaign and she will have little trouble raising another &# million or more longtime aide harold ickes famous for his silent depositions in clinton ii is the seasoned hand on money matters and hell also bring on big labor meanwhile former white house chief of staff john podesta has set up the center for american progress from which she can poach left leaning policy ideas from her national perch on the armed services committee mrs clinton has so far also walked a remarkable tightrope on the iraq war only recently coming out for some sort of "cap" on the number of troops a major story over the coming year will be whether she can resist the defeatist tug of her partys antiwar left as she tries to win the democratic nomination which brings up her biggest liability the fear in many democratic hearts that shes not "electable " mrs clinton carries much of the scandal baggage of her husbands tenure without much of his political charisma if one potential democratic theme is to run against the "divisive" bush republicans hillary is not your ideal "uniter " perhaps american voters wont want to hear about arkansas et cetera all over again but then is that a risk democrats want to take this is where mr obama comes in bidding to be the un hillary at age hes already managed the remarkable feat of writing his own autobiography literally and politically hes applauded for saying hes proud that he did inhale and he has the virtue of being a genuinely fresh face but campaigns have a way of filling in a candidates resumes in ways other than they design including their positions on actual issues mr obama is already moving left on national security which is dangerous ground for a political rookie amid what the pentagon calls "the long war" on terror north carolinas john edwards is another vigorous contender though the erstwhile vice presidential candidate failed to deliver his home state to john kerry last time around this time hes raising the decibels on his "two americas" campaign theme hoping to catch some of that hubert humphrey political magic if he can sell this message as a millionaire trial lawyer hell have earned the nomination the rest of the democratic field includes two governors iowas tom vilsack and new mexicos bill richardson who have solid state records and mr richardson also has foreign policy credentials but both will have trouble breaking through the fund raising barriers erected by the campaign finance limits they themselves have supported this is a shame because both men have something to offer and then there is the usual gaggle of senators dodd biden and even kerry who are running because well because that seems to be what their dna has programmed them to do if we were betting on a wild card challenger wed look instead to al gore the former vice president has been coy about his intentions but he might be getting a ton of free publicity for his global warming "documentary" come oscar time and theres little doubt he could raise money if he got in unlike mrs clinton there are a lot of democrats who feel passionately about him and his near win in there are cycles in politics and after eight years of republicans in the white house democrats in will have the publics normal desire for
