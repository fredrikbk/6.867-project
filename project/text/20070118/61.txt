in the fray why presidential portraiture lost its stature washington days after president fords death on dec his portrait appeared on the washington posts front page the picture hangs in the national portrait gallery the only venue besides the white house with likenesses of all the nations past presidents the post photo of this rather bland and ingratiating production the work of everett raymond kinstler served as a poignant reminder that the once august genre of presidential portraiture has lost its shine think of presidential portraits and the first that comes to mind is most likely gilbert stuarts iconic george washington possibly followed by john singer sargents very differently conceived theodore roosevelt though technically at least as competent as the general run of portraits of postwar presidents in the gallery and the white house this work by mr kinstler painted in a decade after the artists prominently displayed white house portrait of the same president is a far cry from stuarts or sargents achievements in spite of mr kinstlers loose brushwork his ford reads too much like a touched up photograph it operates at the factual prosaic level absent are poetic evocations of character such as the virtues required to shoulder the burdens of the presidential office let alone any symbolic indications of the ties that link ford to the nations ideals and destiny mr kinstlers ford is just a likeable smiling aging hunk of a guy standing next to a table attired in a dark pinstriped three piece suit with one hand perched on the table he boasts a healthy ruddy complexion he might as well be a bank president or major league baseball commissioner how did we get to this point the answer comes by way of sargents roosevelt portrait which hangs in the white houses east room but we must begin at the beginning with stuarts washington on view in the very same room while inspecting the t r portrait in person can be a problem as public access to the white house has become more difficult since the washington is actually a replica from stuarts own hand of his so called landsdowne portrait the original hangs in the national portrait gallery washington sat for stuart in the last year of his presidency the painter crafted a truly definitive characteristic image the idea of washington this idea was not confined to the realm of perception for stuart employed the close observation of natural appearances as a means to an end not as a factual end in itself his washington is no hunk but his defining features are nobly distilled and clarified the origins of this classical approach to realism lie in the sculpture of the hellenistic period which extends from alexander the greats lifetime to that of augustus when artists developed a more particularized approach to the portrayal of philosophers poets statesmen and peasants which they added to the more idealized genres reserved for gods and heroes the supreme exponent of this realism among the artists who portrayed americas founding fathers was not surprisingly a sculptor the great french master jean antoine houdon whose statue and portrait busts of washington are unsurpassed in any medium a plaster bust of washington is on view in the national portrait gallery while houdons life size marble statue stands in the state capitol in richmond va the landsdowne washington is situated in a pictorially and symbolically complex setting he is situated in other words within the grand tradition of european portraiture behind him columns emblems of order are arranged on a diagonal as are a chair and draped table symbols of republican principles and ideals ranging from leather bound tomes to an exposed table leg in the form of the roman fasces abound washington loosely grasps the sword of victory in his left hand while beckoning with his right creating a certain visual tension as he turns slightly to align himself with the dominant diagonal he beckons not to us but to the future to an era of promise opened by the constitutional covenant itself evoked by the rainbow in the background hanging folds of rich fabric intensify the aura of grandeur fast forward to sargents t r painted little more than a century later i had the opportunity to see the picture earlier this month during a white house tour as the artist and his subject walked around the white house in search of the right light and pose sargent the story goes back talked to the impatient and irascible rough rider roosevelt turned in indignation at the top of a stairway clasping a globe finial and sargent told him to hold it right there sargents wonderfully effective use of middling tones in this portraits otherwise blank background casts roosevelt into bold relief left hand assertively perched on hip he faces us squarely full of authority and executive energy and yet the portrait is very much an optical record devoid of symbolic content a quite noticeable penumbra that follows the outline of roosevelts head and left shoulder combined with sargents fluid handling of the figure itself conveys an almost eerily dynamic sense of the act of perception its as if t r were coming into focus before us he squints out at us through his spectacles and we find ourselves squinting back at him the rich color harmonies and attention to finish evident in this and other sargent portraits may link him to the old masters but he fully subscribed to the modern notion that reality lay in perception and that the artists duty was to accurately transcribe natural appearances as they appeared to him or her this concept may not have originated with photography but it was vastly reinforced by it and when we see the national portrait gallerys rather depressing trove of "traditional" portraits of our postwar presidents from greta kemptons truman begun in completed to nelson shankss clinton it is obvious that photography has completely displaced classical sculpture as the conceptual model backdrops like the capitol or the oval office assume a merely incidental significance because unlike the landsdowne these portraits are not conceived in symbolic terms in this narrowing of the gap between art and life art has been drastically short changed true norman rockwells nixon painted in prior to his inauguration early the following year is eye catching in its emphatically asymmetric design the color scheme the seated pensive pose and close up view are also interesting robert sherrs george h w bush projects authority and the integration of the standing president with the east room background largely a result of harmonious color tonalities is very nicely handled but make a black and white reproduction of his face or of nixons as rendered by rockwell and they might well pass for the work of a photography studio picking up where fabian bachrach left off the poetry is just about gone with elaine de koonings jfk one of a series of likenesses of the slain president she produced the torso and extremities are a rather insubstantial matter of slashing brushstrokes and clashing colors capped with a more fully modeled head it is a diverting image particularly in this setting but hardly projects gravitas presidential portraiture should bind the national leaders of our time and of times to come to their predecessors rather than forcing a chasm between past and present a presidential portrait need not remind you of george washington after all a variety of character types have shown themselves equal to the office but it should be an inspiring image accordingly the portraitist should also consider incorporating his subject into a pictorially and symbolically complex setting that evokes an enduring national heritage of liberty sargent of course followed a very different path but he had the good fortune to have as his presidential model a flagrantly powerful personality in the prime of life the fact remains that sargents pictorial outlook was too narrow as a rule for this genre and it is hardly surprising that his less talented successors should have produced a bumper crop of dullness stuarts broader outlook admittedly does not lend itself to formulaic regurgitation starting with the fact that the modern business suit is a very prosaic garment indeed but such an outlook would almost certainly yield a richer harvest if only our presidential portraitists could learn to see their objective as something other than an optical let alone a quasi photographic record mr leigh is at work on a book about public monuments see related letters "letters to the editor living breathing
