politics &amp economics corns rally sends ripples ethanol boom cheers grain farmers pinches food makers the surge in corn prices ignited by the ethanol boom is rippling through the nations economy from the farm belt to wall street to the office soda machine the price of corn the nations no crop in total production and an ingredient in products ranging from sugary syrups to chicken feed to tortillas has doubled since this time last year to &# a bushel despite an abundant harvest and is inching toward the rarely breached &# a bushel mark driving the run up is an unprecedented demand for ethanol a biofuel typically made from corn that many policy makers are counting on to help wean the nation away from foreign oil president bush is expected to intensify demand by calling for yet more production in his state of the union address next week the new demand has much of the agricultural economy humming as corn rallies farmers emboldened by the higher prices or planning to switch to corn or expand their acreage are buying new farm equipment from makers like deere &amp co and cnh global nvs case ih they are spending more on seed from giants like monsanto co and dupont co and fertilizer from companies like mosaic co meanwhile big food companies like tyson foods inc the giant chicken processor and ketchup maker h j heinz co are feeling the pinch bottlers of coca cola co and pepsico inc soft drinks are raising prices partly to offset the rising price of high fructose corn syrup the dominant sweetener in sodas at the center of the tumult ethanol manufacturers like archer daniels midland co are caught between the combination of rising corn prices and falling oil prices which make ethanol less attractive though ethanol benefits from tax breaks and other subsidies those incentives generally go to the companies that blend it with gasoline to make motor fuel rather than to ethanol producers as corn prices rise farmers are racing to cash in leon corzine in assumption ill is planting corn on his acre farm this year up from in the prices he now gets for corn are well above the &# to &# a bushel he has come to expect largely as a result he has spent &# on trucks tractors and grain storage last year mr corzine built an additional grain storage unit an investment equivalent to about &# per bushel of corn with corn prices up he has already recouped that investment "i paid for that grain storage in one year " says mr corzine "thats very unusual " at h &amp r agri power inc a case ih dealer with five locations in kentucky orders for combines the giant machines that help harvest the corn shot up from a year earlier in the last three months of and tractor orders climbed says president wayne hunt just this week two groups of farmers came to an h &amp r dealer to explore buying combines for the cotton fields they are switching to corn he says the increased demand for corn is also driving up sales of nitrogen fertilizer which corn requires in heavy doses mr hunt estimates nitrogen fertilizer sales at his eight kentucky farm supply stores this year will climb to from "we think agricultures future looks pretty bright right now " says mr hunt corn prices set their current record of &# a bushel in as prices soared in response to a supply shortage caused by lower production and stronger export demand the average price of corn from that years crop was &# a bushel also a record todays high prices by contrast follow a corn harvest that the agriculture department last week estimated at billion bushels that is down slightly from the previous years crop but it is still the third largest on record even so the average price for the corn crop is expected to reach &# a bushel with more ethanol plants under construction demand for corn is expected to increase in the years ahead ethanol production totaled about billion gallons last year up from billion the year before according to the renewable fuels association the trade organization representing the ethanol industry next year production is expected to reach more than six billion gallons corns rally has been a headache for the livestock industry which consumes nearly of the u s corn crop pork production costs have increased from last year according to ronald plain an agricultural economist at the university of missouri columbia at the end of last year tyson foods chief executive richard bond warned that higher corn costs would eventually mean higher meat prices at the grocery store last week tyson opened a cattle feeding facility in argentina analysts say this move might signal the beginning of a trend toward shifting meat production overseas "ethanol is going to drive incremental investments related to the meat industry elsewhere " says david nelson an agriculture analyst at credit suisse group food and beverage producers too are feeling cost pressures and in some cases higher corn prices are trickling down to consumers bottlers for coke and pepsi are being buffeted by increases in the price of high fructose corn syrup rising corn prices are one factor behind the increases in soft drink prices that began last year and are expected to continue this year totaling about over says bill pecoriello a beverage industry analyst with morgan stanley the sweetener accounts for about of the cost of goods for coca cola enterprises inc and pepsi bottling group inc coke and pepsis largest bottlers respectively rising corn prices could also affect coke and pepsi themselves though to a lesser extent says mr pecoriello corn syrup accounts for as much as of cokes global cost of goods sold corn used in pepsicos frito lay snacks and in the syrup used in gatorade and pepsis fountain drink business makes up about of such costs in an interview yesterday stephen w sanger chief executive of food giant general mills inc said increased demand for corn would likely cause a spike in the prices of other commodities as farmers devote more acreage to the crop "corn isnt a central item for us in the cereal world but we use a lot of wheat in our cereals and dough and oats are an important grain for us well look to offset those price increases with productivity " mr sanger said during a conference call with analysts in november heinz executives warned that commodity costs this year would be higher than initially expected partly because of the rising cost of the corn sweetener it uses in ketchup in an interview this week art winkleblack the pittsburgh companys financial chief said heinzs overall sweetener costs would be up &# million more than expected this year so far mr winkleblack said heinz hasnt raised the price of its ketchup however it has stopped offering cent per bottle promotional pricing and it has "upsized" from ounce ketchup bottles to and ounce bottles called "fridge door fit " that sell for higher prices at supermarkets analysts say higher prices for beef and pork will likely cause price sensitive consumers to buy less expensive cuts of meat or even chicken with petroleum prices down to &# a barrel the lowest level since may of last year rising corn prices are eating into ethanol makers margins every &# increase in a bushel of corn adds about cents a gallon to the production cost of ethanol according to agriculture department estimates this week investment bank ubs ag lowered its earnings target for two boutique ethanol firms verasun energy corp and aventine renewable energy holdings inc in light of higher corn prices also this week citigroup inc raised the risk profile of archer daniels to high from medium adm is counting on farmers to ramp up corn production which could eventually bring prices back to lower levels "farmers have a strong incentive to plant corn given todays relative value of corn to soybeans " says ed harjehausen senior vice president of adm "based on current prices many believe that farmers will substantially increase corn production this year " the renewable fuels association maintains the ethanol industry will be able to ride out this volatility relatively unscathed dan basse president of chicago research firm agresource co says that while the "bloom is off the rose" for ethanol producers they still have some room before commodity prices eat up their profits for ethanol producers to become unprofitable mr basse estimates corn would have to reach &# a bushel while ethanol prices would have to drop to &# a gallon ethanol now is about &# a gallon betsy mckay contributed to this article
