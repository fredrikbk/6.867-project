home &amp family breast density is tied to cancer women with dense breasts a predominantly genetic condition that affects about one in six are roughly three times more likely to develop breast cancer says a new study published in todays issue of the new england journal of medicine previous studies had established that detecting cancer among women with high breast density measured according to a ratio of lean to fatty tissue was difficult because denser tissue can mask a tumor on an x ray making it harder to find with a mammogram the latest study also makes clear that women with higher density are subject to a greater risk of cancer in the first place breast density is measured by a modern mammogram but doctors rarely discuss the issue with their patients said karla kerlikowske a physician who wrote an accompanying editorial on the findings that should change she said especially now that todays study establishes breast density as one of the major risk factors for breast cancer the american cancer society which recommends annual mammograms for women over years old says it will consider whether women with dense breasts should receive additional screening with an ultrasound after results are released this fall from another study funded by the philanthropic arm of avon products inc and the national cancer institute other risk factors for breast cancer like the genetic mutations brca and brca are more deadly but also far less common less than of the population has a brca genetic mutation by contrast about of adult women have breasts with more lean tissue than fat according to the study and for them the risk increases sharply on average a year old woman has about a chance of developing breast cancer within the next years said norman f boyd a doctor at princess margaret hospital in toronto who led the study for women with more lean than fatty tissue in their breasts that risk roughly triples the study found about women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the u s and roughly die of it making it the most common cancer among women and the second most deadly behind lung cancer according to the american cancer society unlike lung cancer where nine of cases are caused by smoking breast cancer is much more difficult to predict for now women with dense breasts should consider having a digital mammogram conducted by a breast specialist instead of a film based one said wendie a berg the doctor leading the avon study "a lot of people who read mammograms are general radiologists who probably dont have the expertise they need to read mammograms " she said
