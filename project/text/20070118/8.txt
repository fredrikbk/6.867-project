airbus proves to be albatross to eads likely loss at plane maker crimps its parents finances new charges on the horizon paris the surprise announcement of a probable financial loss at airbus for indicates troubles are set to continue at the european plane maker and its parent company for many months airbus which is owned by franco german european aeronautic defence &amp space co said yesterday that was its best year ever in terms of aircraft deliveries and its second best in terms of new aircraft ordered but the strong sales arent enough to offset massive financial charges that airbus and eads face because of deep industrial problems at the plane maker as a result eads said it expects its earnings before interest and tax or ebit will be hurt by a probable loss at airbus eads chief financial officer hans peter ring said that profits at eadss other divisions including defense space and helicopters will "roughly balance out" the probable loss at airbus indicating eads should more or less break even at the level of earnings before interest and taxes a basic gauge of operating profit for he said those divisions "are delivering as expected " the unexpected profit warning plus airbuss disclosure that it could report new unspecified charges increases uncertainty about the state of eadss finances over coming years that murkiness is compounded by the possibility of a capital increase at eads and concerns about how airbus will handle a radical restructuring program that managers have been developing since july during the past year airbus has been plagued by production delays on its a superjumbo the largest passenger plane ever to be built it also had to go back to the drawing board last summer to redesign its new long range jetliner the a eads late last year warned it would take a hit to earnings of more than billion euros &# billion because of airbus over the next four years airbus had also announced a massive restructuring program dubbed power that it acknowledged would hurt eadss bottom line but the market hadnt anticipated that all these extra charges would drive airbus into the red as soon as eads stock fell yesterday to euros in paris trading in its statement and at a news conference eads didnt give any indication of how big the loss at airbus would be it further spooked investors by warning that "additional a charges not originally envisaged could apply " but it tried to cushion the blow by saying the likely loss at airbus is the result of a decision to accelerate charges that had been slated for coming years "we are clearing the ground to start again on a sound basis " said louis gallois the chief executive of airbus and co ceo of eads eads also said it is considering a capital increase or other form of fund raising without giving further details eads must cover aircraft development expenses of more than billion euros amid its financial squeeze from both the internal problems and the persistently weak u s dollar "we are in discussions with our core shareholders on how to strengthen our capital base " said mr ring those shareholders are german car maker daimlerchrysler ag the french government and french media group lagardere sca which together hold almost of eads mr ring said eads expects to decide by mid april if and how it will tap financial markets for fresh funding though airbus had its best year for sales in the performance of the european plane maker was well behind that of boeing co the u s plane maker outsold airbus for the first time in five years airbus landed of gross new orders by number of planes but it won only in dollar terms because it sold fewer big and pricey aircraft than boeing airbus has been losing ground to boeing over the past two years in orders for large twin aisle aircraft planes that fly longer distances and sell for fatter profit margins than single aisle models because airlines say boeings models are less expensive to operate than those from airbus airbus delayed by more than a year the start of work on its planned a model while boeings competing and models have sold at a fast clip airbus delivered jetliners last year marking the fourth straight year airbus has topped boeing which delivered jetliners both rivals say delivery levels could be roughly equal this year at around planes each airbuss crisis gradually deepened throughout the year after the a delays were first announced in june sparking a change of management in october eads said it would take a hit of billion euros on the a program because of production problems penalty payments to customers for delays and other snags the a design changes could cost million euros more no cost figure has been offered for power details of which will be announced next month mr gallois said mr ring who recently took the additional title of financial chief of airbus said the exact magnitude of airbus charges being expensed in will be revealed when eads closes its books for the year and announces full year results on march "the closing of the airbus accounts is complex and probably more complex than we had expected " mr ring said
