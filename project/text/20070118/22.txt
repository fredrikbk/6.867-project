cross country shades of gray sacramento calif ted kennedy the nations most persistent backer of nationalized health care must be smiling at the irony almost four decades after he first proposed the idea gov arnold schwarzenegger a kennedy relative by marriage is touting his own version of universal coverage and if adopted the idea could go nationwide quickly its no wonder critics are already dubbing the ostensibly republican chief executive "schwarzenkennedy " this isnt the first time mr kennedy has found a republican to carry water for him in after medicare spending had increased by more than in five years although the number of people enrolled grew by only richard nixon declared a "health care cost crisis" and worked with mr kennedy to propose mandatory employer provided health insurance the idea foundered but a modified version now has been revived by mr schwarzenegger who wants to require that every person buy health insurance or be covered by an employer or the government massachusetts has a more modest law in place and an adviser to mitt romney helped schwarzenegger aides on their plan liberals are overjoyed at the about face by a governor who in vetoed a democratic bill that would have merely expanded the states coverage of children saying the &# million price tag was too high assembly speaker fabian nunez praises the governors new proposal "this is a plan assembly democrats could have written " indeed they already have and mr schwarzenegger fiercely opposed it at the time in then gov gray davis fighting to stave off his recall signed a law mandating employers with or more employees provide health coverage or pay into a state fund that would provide it after mr davis was recalled mr schwarzenegger helped lead an effort to repeal what he called a "job killing health care tax " in of voters agreed and repealed universal coverage in the same election in which george w bush lost the state by percentage points and the highly liberal sen barbara boxer was re elected by points but the next year mr schwarzenegger suffered a stinging defeat as public employee unions spent &# million in a special election to defeat four reform initiatives he supported a chastened governator swung left by hiring as top aides susan kennedy and daniel zingale two former deputy chiefs of staff to the recalled mr davis jason kinney a davis speechwriter joked that he had decided "to finish the second term of gray davis " no one is laughing now the behind the scenes architects of much of the governors plan were ms kennedy and mr zingale who also served as mr daviss director of managed health care last november gov schwarzenegger won landslide re election in part by winning of republicans with an ironclad pledge not to raise taxes he pounded phil angelides his democratic opponent for wanting to raise taxes by &# billion to pay for universal health care but now the estimated cost of the schwarzenegger plan to cover californias uninsured including two million illegal aliens is &# billion state subsidies for people to buy insurance will extend to those earning up to &# a year more than californias median income "hes creating a welfare state where more than half the people are in the wagon being pulled than outside the wagon pulling " says one health care analyst as bad as the policy implications are the governors plan may be fatally flawed politically he insists it doesnt raise taxes despite billions in new charges on doctors hospitals and employers he prefers to call the new revenue "in lieu fees" and "coverage dividends " "he excoriated phil angelides rightly for proposing the same tax increases he has put on the table " says gop state sen tom mcclintock "he is now pushing the second largest tax increase in california history i wont be able to trust anything he says " whether the new revenue is a tax or not is important because if it is a tax the plan must garner a very difficult two thirds vote in both legislative houses barring that the california supreme court will have trouble with the concept a fee on employers who dont offer health insurance probably requires only a majority vote however the imposition of a levy on the gross revenues of doctors and hospitals is almost certainly a tax that would require two thirds approval then there are the feds the &# billion a year in extra federal medicaid money which the governor is banking on is shaky an even greater barrier is erisa the federal pension law that preempts all state laws that regulate employee benefits last summer a federal judge threw out marylands so called "wal mart law" requiring large firms to spend of their payroll on health care because "state laws which impose health or welfare mandates on employers are invalid under erisa " just yesterday a federal appeals court upheld the ruling voiding the maryland law rather than pursue a legally dubious universal coverage proposal mr schwarzenegger should have pursued the universal access he used to tout he could sign up more of the nearly one million californians eligible for current health programs but not yet enrolled the coverage mandates that make insurance so expensive idaho has only could be reduced and residents allowed to buy coverage from other states nurse practitioners could be allowed to set up their own clinics instead the governors plan piles on a new mandate that bars insurers from turning down anyone based on health status or age when new jersey instituted a similar rule in premiums jumped mr schwarzenegger insists he is pursuing a centrist course that borrows from both the right and left but more realistically he is imitating richard nixons old strategy of throwing rhetorical bones to his right while attempting to appease the left with liberal programs emmet john hughes an eisenhower speechwriter who knew nixon well once said he "judged any declaration of speech not by its content but by its impact " that explains nixons dramatic lurches into or toward wage price controls a guaranteed annual income and mandatory employer health insurance arnold schwarzenegger used to claim he admired ronald reagan most "because he stuck by his principles when others wouldnt " but with his rube goldberg health plan mr schwarzenegger has demonstrated that at his core he prefers roles more suited to tricky dick than the gipper should he succeed the long term dream of nationalized health care held by ted kennedy and hillary clinton will be closer to reality than ever mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com
