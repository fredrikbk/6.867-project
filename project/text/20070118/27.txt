democrats push climate change to front burner strategy aims to draw bush into negotiations industries sort options washington the new democratic led congress is trying to put its mark on one of the most contentious environmental and economic problems within reach climate change the initiative is one of the starkest signs of the transformation of washingtons agenda as a result of novembers election while the senate has debated climate change moves for several years the house of representatives under republican control for the past years has done relatively little now house speaker nancy pelosi is moving to ramp up debates on energy and how to curb so called greenhouse gases which most scientists believe are accelerating global warming by trapping the suns heat in the atmosphere but the californian already is discovering how controversial any effort will be even within her own party ms pelosi is expected to announce today that she is creating a select committee on climate change and energy independence that will be empowered to hold hearings her strategy is to raise the profile of the issue and press for action by early summer in an interview last evening ms pelosi said she saw energy independence and climate change legislation as part of the next phase of the democratic agenda after passing bills on issues such as the minimum wage and student loans "tomorrow we finish our hours and i will talk about what comes next and included in that is energy independence climate change is part of energy independence " she said "were asking our chairmen to have their hearings and submit their legislation in time for us to introduce an energy independence package no later than the fourth of july " by raising the issues profile democrats say ms pelosi will be better able to put pressure on the white house to come to the bargaining table but her effort is angering committee chairmen less eager to move quickly particularly powerful michigan rep john dingell the michigan lawmaker has expressed his ire at what he considers an intrusion into his house energy and commerce committees jurisdiction over energy and climate change legislation bills already circulating in the senate have in common a mandatory cap on emissions a step that according to the white house president bush isnt prepared to advocate in next weeks state of the union address however industry and environmental groups see mr bush as a potential broker who could help shape a consensus particularly in the senate where votes would be needed to overcome a filibuster promised by oklahoma republican sen james inhofe the effort has enormous implications for american businesses and manufacturers which are split on the best course the coal mining oil production and utility sectors are likely to be hardest hit since they sell fossil fuels that give off carbon dioxide the most common greenhouse gas or derive their energy from it among the forces urging action are industries worried that states are producing a patchwork of regulations california has a new law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while new mexico minnesota south carolina and florida are working on their own plans dozens of u s cities have imposed emissions restrictions a federal law could preempt further local and state efforts the most striking example of u s industrys evolution toward engaging the issue is oil giant exxon mobil corp which has long been a leading opponent of emissions rules but has begun talking about how to structure them the oil industry also faces other pressures today the house is set to vote on whether to cut subsidies for u s oil production "we now believe the legislative dance has formally begun " says steve cochran a legislative analyst for environmental defense a new york based group which has been leading the charge for a cap and trade approach that would encourage trading in emissions credits that could soften the impact on industries companies that reduce their emissions below assigned caps could earn credits to sell to other companies that want to avoid penalties for exceeding their caps the flagship among the cap and trade bills was unveiled last week by republican sen john mccain of arizona and democratic sens joseph lieberman of connecticut and barack obama of illinois the legislation would require industries to reduce their emissions to levels by and then further decrease emissions by about a year through the measure calls for the nations emissions to be reduced by two thirds by less demanding versions of the bill were rejected by the senate twice before a more modest approach being prepared by democratic sen jeff bingaman of new mexico calls for industries to stabilize their emissions by at levels registered in after that the bingaman bill would impose reductions below levels the bill expected to attract some industry and republican support is regarded as a fallback measure if the mccain lieberman obama approach fails "we want to occupy the center ground " a bingaman spokesman says a third approach sponsored by independent sen bernie sanders of vermont calls on the nation to reduce emissions to levels by and to make an reduction by democratic sen barbara boxer of california chairman of the senate environment and public works committee calls this bill with its steep cuts the "gold standard " her panel will play a major role on the issue while these bills would require utilities coal mines oil companies and other businesses across the economy to make the cuts a fourth measure submitted yesterday by democratic sen dianne feinstein of california focuses only on utilities that make electricity they would be required to reduce their emissions by by the bill is supported by six major utilities including californias pg&amp e corp and florida power &amp light companies that have long experience with emissions trading required by the clean air act in the house the climate change issue is already stoking tensions democratic rep edward markey of massachusetts is the leading candidate to head the new select committee which is designed to be largely a communications vehicle able to cut across the traditional lines of the tax writing energy science and environment panels but mr dingell who is the most upset about the pelosi approach is expected to host a meeting today of his committees democrats who by chance also include chairmen of other relevant panels such as the science and oversight and government reform committees ms pelosi said the proposed select committee would "absolutely not" intrude on jurisdiction of existing panels but serve to collect information and raise the profile of the issue her office said the new panel wont be empowered to initiate legislation but committee heads expressed concern it would distract from their work and permit changes to be imposed on their bills through the house rules committee which the speaker controls there is also a potential disconnect between the goals of ms pelosis agenda the increase in domestic oil gas and coal production likely needed to achieve energy independence would entail heightened output of greenhouse gases a significant part of the debate on climate change will focus on the bills impact on the economy however some people who have designed the computer software used to calculate the projections say the bills contain many imponderables including assumptions about the potential emergence of cleaner technologies that cant be modeled so far only the cost of mr bingamans bill has been estimated the energy departments energy information administration projects it would reduce the nations gross domestic economy by or &# billion between and but the energy department study assumes the emergence of a new generation of nuclear power plants and other emission reduction technologies that havent appeared yet says alan beamon who helped prepare the study "theres an awful lot of uncertainty on how markets will evolve to meet those needs " he says computer models have diverged before a study on the version of the mccain lieberman bill by the massachusetts institute of technology predicted the measure would increase consumer costs by over a couple of decades while cra international a boston based consulting group put the cost at times higher "models all assume that technological change happens smoothly " says anne smith a vice president of cra "but when they do that they underestimate the effort it will take of solving some of these problems " jason grumet staff director of the bipartisan national commission on energy policy says the uncertainty of the models requires a "safety valve" in any emissions trading plan so that the government could step in if legislation threatened economic stability
