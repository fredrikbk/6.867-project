reserve chairman ben bernanke warned that a u s economic disaster awaits unless the ticking time bomb of entitlement spending is defused in testimony seemingly designed to grab the new democratic congress by the lapels the top monetary policy maker sounded an unmistakable alarm on fiscal policy telling the senate budget committee that the recent improvement in the federal budget gap was merely the "calm before the storm " the storm is what a large number of economists expect will be a spine snapping bounce in federal spending on social security and medicare as the baby boom generation enters retirement mr bernanke told the panel that entitlement spending could shoot to of gross national product by compared to about of gdp now and that the problem isnt something that the economy can grow its way out of forestalling reform could lead to a ballooning debt higher interest rates and a painful retrenchment in the form of sharp spending cuts tax increases or both "the longer we wait the more severe the more draconian the more difficult the objectives are going to be " mr bernanke said offering that change was past due "i think the right time to start was about years ago " lawmakers lapped it up budget committee chairman kent conrad the north dakota democrat said he hoped that "people are listening about the need for us to address these long term imbalances to take these challenges on and the sooner we do so the better " the highest ranking republican on the panel was equally receptive mr bernankes warning was "right on and a clarion call that i hope folks will listen to " said sen judd gregg but if legislators seem of one mind on the notion that bulging entitlement payments will some day come along and chop the economy off at the knees theres very little

swatted it down treasury secretary henry paulson is exploring options for entitlement reform however and mr bush has made it known that he intends to make another run at altering social security some economists who may have tuned in to the proceedings for hints about the future course of interest rates said that as dire as the fed chairmans warning sounded the "calm before the storm" may have
