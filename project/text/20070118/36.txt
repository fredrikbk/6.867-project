eyes on the road the pros and cons of the cars of tomorrow hybrid vehicles take the spotlight at detroit show it is january and that can only mean one thing it is time to play "build it or bag it " in which car enthusiasts can give thumbs up or down to the design ideas put forward by auto makers at the north american international auto show in detroit this years show which opened to the public saturday after media previews last week lacked a knockout car designed for actual production comparable to last years chevy camaro concept which is headed to showrooms in about two years some media folks complained that this years show was relatively quiet reflecting perhaps the uncertainty about the prospects of the detroit auto giants still the designers and technology futurists who like to use auto shows to gauge interest in their out of the box ideas didnt come up completely empty as ideas for alternatives to internal combustion engines took the spotlight here is a look at a few of the potential cars of tomorrow chevrolet volt the most talked about concept car at this years show is general motors corp s latest salvo in its battle to persuade consumers and lawmakers that it is just as serious about greening the automobile as toyota motor corp the volt is a show car but not a real car gm said the volt was designed to exhibit what the company calls its "e flex" propulsion system instead of using a small gas engine to propel the car in tandem with a battery powered electric motor as in the toyota prius the volt would use a small gas engine solely to recharge a lithium ion battery pack electricity from those batteries the same type that power laptop computers would power the vehicle the batteries also could be recharged by plugging into the power grid perhaps through a wall socket thus gm got points for taking seriously the concept of a plug in hybrid which is all the rage in certain circles pros the volts exterior design a scaled down car that borrows strongly from the look of the camaro concept would look pretty good on a real chevy small car and the e flex power system is a great idea cons the technology to make a car like the volt reliable and affordable doesnt exist gm is looking for the federal government to help cover the cost of developing lithium ion batteries that wont cost too much or catch on fire jaguar cx f this is one of the more dramatic show cars on display in detroit among the category of cars that might actually see production autoweek the enthusiast magazine dubbed the cx f "best in show" among the concept cars bristling with technology the cx f had a supercharged liter v rated at more than horsepower pros the cx f is a step forward for jaguar design chief ian callums effort to rescue the brand from irrelevance the british luxury brand has a potent looking vision of what st century jags might be sporty fast and a little mean cons it should have been on the road years ago toyota ft hs on the surface the concept car is yet another version of toyotas effort to use gas electric hybrid drive technology for the purposes of boosting power and performance the inelegantly named ft hs impresses with a gas electric power plant that can produce horsepower from a liter v pros get ready for the son of supra after a long hiatus bad boy toyotas are coming back cons most people willing to pay the extra price for a gas electric hybrid want the system to deliver superior fuel economy not a kick in the pants from a stoplight lincoln mkr the mkr represents a stab at a new direction built using some of the underpinnings of the ford mustang rear wheel drive chassis the mkr offers a futuristic interpretation of the classic lincoln "waterfall grille " and an athletic stance not seen in lincoln cars since well forever pros at last a lincoln car concept that looks like something cons ford is such a mess it may not be able to make a production version of the car until joseph b white is the journals detroit bureau chief his column appears each monday on wsj com
