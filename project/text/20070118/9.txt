battle casualties lost in translation iraqs injured terps after interpreting for american troops they fear going home amman jordan cocky cheerful ali adil thought he found his calling as an interpreter with the third marines patrolling iraqs most dangerous ground the pay was good and he loved bantering about women and rock n roll with young americans by helping marines root out insurgents he believed he was building a peaceful and just iraq but since july when a suicide bomber drove an explosives filled tanker into a building his unit was guarding the year old mr adil has faced a different future after suffering severe burns he has undergone nine skin grafts at a hospital in amman and lives in a dormitory with a dozen other wounded iraqi interpreters "terps" as the americans call them looking to avoid adding refugees jordan wants the iraqis to leave the country when they are released from the hospital and no longer need postoperative treatment the interpreters look at a return to iraq as a death sentence their absence from home already may have endangered their families "when someone is gone for a while and nobody knows if hes really dead the militias start asking is he with the americans " says mr adil who says his family routinely receives death threats from shiite militias in his old basra neighborhood since the start of the war iraqi interpreters have been killed says titan corp of san diego which just completed a five year &# billion pentagon contract to provide linguists to u s forces most of those killed were assassinated while on home leave the company says hobbling on crutches or rolling through their days in wheelchairs the terps see themselves as combat veterans of americas war which should entitle them to medical care pensions and safety most want to emigrate to the u s after lobbying by the u s marine corps congress approved a special immigration program for translators in but just slots a year were granted which must be shared between iraqi and afghan applicants with at least a years service with u s combat troops more than locals have served in iraq as interpreters some lawmakers and u s officials have argued that if the u s made it too easy for skilled iraqis to leave fewer would remain to help build iraq and if special benefits are carved out for interpreters thousands more iraqis who have worked with americans from drivers to nurses to soldiers would also demand similar help this week during a senate judiciary committee hearing lawmakers from both parties said more should be done to help iraqis particularly those who have helped the u s war effort assistant secretary of state ellen sauerbrey said only iraqis have been admitted to the u s as refugees since and because of increasing violence last year more iraqis are fleeing their homes than are returning to them in their dormitory here interpreters display the kind of tolerance u s war planners hoped would take root in iraq shiites sunnis christians and kurds mingle their combat experience outweighing religious and ethnic divisions the terps come from secular households and call each other by their combat nicknames adding to their sense of solidarity and distance from iraqs murderous sectarianism mr adil a shiite is "milan" because he liked to play as the ac milan soccer team in playstation soccer games moghera al gaylany a wealthy sunni who learned english from a welsh nanny is "m " he suffered eye and arm injuries from shrapnel abdul al basit a kurd who was hit by sniper fire in his arms and abdomen is "alan " between therapy sessions the interpreters swap stories and sometimes view video of the attacks that sent them to amman such videos were usually taken by intelligence officers on the scene the wounded terps sent here for treatment about last year stay weeks or months the hospitals management asked that the facilitys name not be published for fear of attack amputees are the norm diyer hassan arrived in november still in a coma after leaving iraq where he had been on a predawn baghdad patrol with the u s armys th infantry the year old awoke in a hospital room to discover his legs amputated just below the pelvis he had been working to raise cash to finish at baghdad university and earn an accounting degree in a nearby room is one of the oldest terps rabeh khafaji a year old shiite nicknamed "marcos " he was close to troops he patrolled with and says he "adopted" his year old platoon leader lt emily perez told recently that she died in the same explosion that took both his lower legs the former merchant seaman clutched ms perezs photo to his chest and sobbed "my beautiful child " when u s and british forces swept through iraq in mr adil was hopeful about the future he says his father an elderly shiite shopkeeper and his christian mother did their best to steer their eight sons from trouble when two were drafted during the iran iraq war the family bribed a base commander to assign them cooks jobs far from the front when other shiites rebelled against saddam hussein after the war "we hid under our beds " he says the family longed for the dictators demise and joined neighbors greeting the first troops entering basra fresh out of a two year technical high school the slim teenager was eager to test his rudimentary english learned mostly from listening to an older brothers pink floyd records and by surfing the internet he says he landed a job paying &# a month as an interpreter for a company of the british armys royal engineers mr adil the second youngest child suddenly became the familys principal breadwinner while one brother lined up work as a policeman most of the others held day laborer jobs one brother amjad adil now drove his own cab until carjackers took it he too then went to work for the british and was quickly dubbed "tommy gun" for his admiration of automatic weapons although the adil brothers say their work was routine translating for british officers meeting local dignitaries insurgents slipped at least three threatening letters under the familys front door warning them to quit letters tacked to nearby lampposts listed neighbors already killed for collaborating worried about his safety ali left for baghdad in january and found work with titan the main contractor supplying u s forces with interpreters titan paid him &# a month three times the salary of iraqi police which included a small bonus for working in the dangerous sunni triangle the few u s citizens who work as interpreters and have high security clearances make times as much as bilingual iraqis in october amjad fled to baghdad to work for titan too after he and another interpreter were fired on by four men in basra amjad adil escaped injury his friend was shot in the face the two brothers remember their tours with the marines starting in late as the most gratifying part of the war "motivation mobilization " ali adil shouted when asked what he loved about the marines nearly jumping from a chair as he assumed his battlefield stance in al anbar province he joined raids on suspected terrorists safe houses often discovering weapons cash and computer files whose data led marines to other targets some of the finds were unsettling the marines couldnt tell if u s issued m s and body armor they found had been stripped from dead comrades or stolen by infiltrators working on u s bases night raids were an adrenaline rush after a fusilier launched a concussion grenade through an open window mr adil would dash into the building with other troops as an explosion shook the building and filled its entrance with blinding light "its something you never forget not for the rest of your life " he says nothing terrified him as much as hearing a patrol leader bark the order "take cover sniper " and hitting the ground "he was the best interpreter we had " says sgt nate royster a squad leader with the third marines the chatty mr adil would strike up friendships with iraqi families passing through marine checkpoints and over time would persuade them to identify iraqis who were shooting at the marines or planting bombs he was also great at picking out iraqis who were lying sgt royster says mr adil and his brother swapped emails regularly from bases three hours apart after six months they had a week off together at the main marine base in haditha where they shopped and played videogames "we would call home together both of us talking to our mother and father " amjad adil recalls "it was like a family reunion " news from home often was grim during some calls the brothers could hear mortar rounds landing near the familys home which is close to a british base their parents provided updates on childhood friends who had been killed or seized one neighbor family paid a large ransom when their son was kidnapped but the young man never returned the adil parents said one day in july ali adil walked downstairs from a marine rooftop post near haditha to join iraqi troops making morning tea at the same moment a stolen tanker filled with at least pounds of explosives rammed into the building the driver and several iraqi soldiers were killed mr adil who suffered burns over one third of his body and three marines with life threatening wounds were evacuated to baghdad after waking from a two week coma mr adil was transferred to amman for long term care for two months nurses tried to make him comfortable before skin graft treatment began his jaw was wired shut to let several small fractures heal most days he simply lay in bed sucking soup from a straw when he felt hungry enough to eat now hes able to walk on his own and passes time either in internet cafes or telephoning his brother despite the trauma mr adil retains his good cheer "hows it going on dude " he greets another terp titan a subsidiary of l communications holdings inc says it will pay mr adils medical bills and two thirds of his salary until he is officially discharged from treatment which he expects to occur later this month the principal insurer for u s contractors american international group inc s aig worldsource division wont specify how much treating interpreters cost last year except to say that it runs into "millions" of dollars one interpreter victor yousif has medical bills of more than &# million alone hospital administrators say mr adils remaining benefit is an injury compensation package such packages can range from &# to &# the money is intended to cover potential income interpreters can expect to lose as a result of their injuries many interpreters say the awards dont come close to covering their needs especially those who support extended families trying to flee iraq for the most part though interpreters accept whats offered because they need the money immediately "they gave me &# for this " says one middle aged former professor who worked as an interpreter for a u s army unit as he lifts an empty pant leg and then shows a right hand shorn of all but the middle finger families of translators killed on the job receive a death benefit spouses receive of the interpreters weekly salary until they remarry or die if there is no spouse the benefit goes to a parent because of iraqs chaotic situation its often difficult to obtain reports and witness statements necessary to prove a claim it can take several months to a year to settle a claim during his three years working for the u s military one iraqi translator received numerous threats on sept he was killed in a drive by shooting as he drove home after a day of working with the army reserves th civil affairs battalion capt brian freeman says he relied on the interpreter as his "eyes and ears" and also for political connections for the mans nine member family the loss took away not only a loved one but the main provider they relied on his &# a month salary his pregnant wife and other family members are waiting to receive the death benefit chris winans vice president of media relations at aig says the company doesnt discuss individual claims but he says that when claims cant be settled quickly its usually related to problems of documentation or locating next of kin "our top priority is promptly settling compensable claims for injured defense contract workers and thats the way it works in much more than of claims " he says during many u s wars evacuating local allies wasnt a big issue the vast majority of local allies stayed put after conflicts ended eager to rebuild their countries hundreds of thousands of former south vietnamese soldiers and other american allies were left behind when u s forces withdrew in many spending much of the next decade scrambling for ways to get to america about vietnamese collaborators and their dependents managed to get to the u s by although many more languished for years in refugee camps in thailand hong kong and the philippines after the gulf war the u s admitted around iraqi shiite refugees who escaped a crackdown by saddam hussein in iraq today the u s military discourages fraternizing with local hires even so terps and military personnel often forge close ties sharon smith a major in the u s army reserves married her iraqi interpreter in after she hired a judge and had him transported to the fortified green zone in baghdad to perform the ceremony after a bureaucratic tussle over visas that lasted a year the interpreter who had been wounded in action was able join his wife in richmond va just before thanksgiving other wounded interpreters who lack such ties to americans worry they will soon be stateless pressured to leave jordan unable to return to iraq where they fear their names already are on a hit list but barred from the u s "if i tell doctors in iraq how i am wounded i am killed in one day " said a year old translator from karbala who requested that only his first name haider appear in print "the militias rule the hospitals in iraq " he added as fellow exiles in the amman dormitory nodded in agreement under the special immigration program for translators about visas have been approved so far of the more than locals who have served in iraq as interpreters many are desperate to leave few qualify because they need a letter of recommendation from a military "flag" officer either a four star general or a navy admiral "the highest rank we meet are lieutenants maybe a captain " says abdul al basit the kurdish translator who has been trying to emigrate since being wounded by a sniper last year in al hawijah "how are we going to meet a general " two married iraqi interpreters who asked to be identified by their terp nicknames "mike" and "joy" won translator visas in the couple who wont use their real names for fear of identifying family members still in iraq served together in western iraq with mike accompanying a marine combat unit and joy assigned to help nurses at a mobile surgical unit early in the war insurgents seized the bus she was taking to a u s base and held her for awhile it wasnt just their war records but their lobbying skills that helped them win visas after three years of service they befriended influential u s officers including capt joseph grimm a marine attorney who helped them with the paperwork and lobbied the pentagon brass and lawmakers on their behalf last month mike and joy visited their wounded counterparts in amman "you were in al anbar dude thats awesome " said a young terp who calls himself "opie " reaching up to slap mikes hand with the stub of his own a few terps asked them for ideas on how to get to the u s but other interpreters found the visit dispiriting noticing the couples sleek clothing their digital camera and most of all their incredible good fortune only deepened their sense of isolation by the end of the evening mike was bummed out too as he realized few of the terps had a chance of winning a visa "i have citations like a hundred of them " he said sounding more defensive than proud "some of these guys have like two " one of the terps at the dormitory mr al gaylany who was wounded by a roadside bomb last summer has made some bureaucratic headway he spends his days tapping out emails in search of soldiers from the military police unit he served with to ask for their help staff sgt jason rogers has already written to his senator "we rotate in and rotate out but hes stuck there " says sgt rogers now stationed with a national guard unit in bay city mich "id like to see him become a u s citizen it would be a great way to show appreciation for what hes done " joanna gonzalez spokeswoman for the department of homeland security says "if any iraqi translator or any iraqi for that matter outside iraq fears persecution if he or she returns to iraq then they can apply for refugee settlement in the u s " she says that this year up to refugees will be allowed into the u s from the near east and south asia a region that includes iraq as well as afghanistan iran saudi arabia india pakistan and other countries there are also refugee slots for that arent tied to a specific area and will be allocated based on need terps are especially vulnerable says enrique kelly casualty manager for u s defense contractor titan "the interpreters are on no ones side " the retired u s soldier says "the shia hate them the sunnis hate them the americans dont trust them because they could be infiltrators as soon as they lose our protection theyll be hunted down " mr adil and his brother figure theyll never qualify for visas neither knows any senior military officials and amjad doesnt plan to stay in iraq long enough to apply he wants to move to syria where several terps already have found haven "i told my mother this was the end for me " he said as he prepared to return to his marine base after a vacation in december "she cried she doesnt want any of us to do this anymore " for his part ali expects to leave amman by the end of this month rather than return to a translator job in iraq he plans to wait for his settlement which he figures will be about &# he thinks that ought to be enough to hire a smuggler who will lead him to a path other iraqis have followed to tijuana mexico then on to san diego there hes confident hell be allowed to petition u s authorities for asylum or at least find someone in southern californias growing iraqi community to put up bond if hes jailed hes also counting on help from former marine mates many of whom live in san diego county "i risked my life with the marines " he says "how can they refuse me "
