flying to far flung spots in asia on the cheap as discount carriers expand range of travelers options we test the quality of service on no frills airline jetstar you wont get pretzels pillows or hot towels but you might get a cheap ticket and for an extra &# you can have a delicious plate of coconut sticky rice served in a banana leaf singapore based jetstar asia airways pte ltd is one of dozens of new low cost airlines transforming asias travel landscape copying the model set by european discounters like ryanair ltd more than budget airlines have launched in asia since by stripping out perks and relentlessly cutting costs these airlines offer one way tickets for as little as &# including taxes they now serve growing tourism hubs in asia including siem reap cambodia shenzhen china and goa india while most of these carriers focus on short hops of three hours or less some of the newest such as oasis hong kong airlines ltd are offering long haul routes like hong kong to london at fares starting at &# including taxes and fees oasis plans to start flights to chicago and oakland calif later this year asias discount airline boom is changing the way many americans visit the region making it cheaper to visit multiple destinations in a single trip the simplest way for u s travelers to make use of these airlines is to buy a round trip ticket to a major asian city well served by discounters such as bangkok singapore kuala lumpur or delhi and then book side trips on budget carriers the discounters have opened up access to dozens of new tourism sites such as kuching malaysia where you can trek through borneos tropical rain forests and the quiet island of ban ko jum thailand where you can drink pineapple shakes on deserted beaches since most of the discounters fly new aircraft they generally have good if short safety records the disappearance of an adam air flight in bad weather in indonesia nearly three weeks ago raised some concerns about safety in a rapidly growing industry that plane was years old but what is it actually like to travel on asias flying buses to find out we took a jaunt through southeast asia starting in hong kong and made a loop through bangkok phuket singapore and back to hong kong testing four discounters we also took a &# flight from london to hong kong on oasis the new long haul carrier all five flights were on time nobody lost our luggage and service was generally upbeat and friendly although we did overhear one airasia flight attendant tell a british passenger whose seat belt didnt fit that he should lose weight it wasnt all smooth flying we nearly missed a weekend in bangkok because orient thai airlines co ltd sold us a one way ticket to thailand neglecting to mention that thai immigration authorities wouldnt let us into the country without a return ticket tiger airways plane had threadbare rugs and an unsettling sani flush smell wafting through the cabin and while our general oasis experience was excellent the plane had personalized tv screens with free video channels dont get us started on the slimy red gelatin concoction served for dessert on that flight the airline says it has improved its meal service on the london hong kong route booking can be a hassle since asias budget carriers dont show up on fare consolidation sites like expedia and phone booking often requires calling overseas the easiest way for americans to book is to buy tickets directly from the individual carriers web site getting the cheapest fares often requires booking months ahead some of these airlines fly into budget terminals or secondary airports that can complicate matters if you need to make connections and like their u s and european counterparts asias budget airlines typically charge extra for food entertainment and baggage exceeding about pounds we had one of our best experiences on jetstar which has hubs in singapore and australia the fun began before the plane took off from singapore for hong kong while many discount carriers fly out of bare bones terminals jetstar flies out of the main terminal of singapores luxurious changi airport where you can hang out in a jacuzzi get a foot reflexology massage or visit the free movie theater as you wait for your flight jetstars pristine plane had cushy leather seats and for &# you could rent a digital entertainment console on board oasis which we flew from londons gatwick airport to hong kong youd never know you werent on a full fare carrier oasis purchases its planes from singapore airlines which is known for its luxurious aircraft the stylish purple seats had adequate legroom and individual lcd screens options on the free video channels ranged from "oceans " to "initial d" a japanese film about a nerdy tofu delivery man turned celebrity race car driver meals were included we were less pleased with our trip on orient thai primarily a charter airline that offers some discount seats to travelers on international flights between destinations such as bangkok and hong kong orient thai didnt offer phone or internet booking so we wound up buying a ticket at the hong kong airport a few minutes before our flight left the ticketing desk sold us a one way ticket to bangkok just minutes later the check in staff refused to let us board saying that thai immigration required passengers to have a ticket out of thailand in order to enter the country we raced back to the ticket desk and purchased a second leg ticket in the end we barely made the flight we paid &# for our one way ticket which wasnt much cheaper than the full fare carriers orient thai chief executive udom tantiprasongchai said tickets on that route normally sell for as little as &# and said it was "good to know" about our unpleasant experience because the company outsources ticketing and check in in hong kong to another firm our brief flight from bangkok to phuket on malaysias airasia was efficient and uneventful airasia is the largest discounter in asia with routes and aircraft the plane had nice leather seats and the menu included items like crabstick sandwiches the only hitch online booking closed hours before the flight took off so we had to buy our ticket at the airport singapores tiger airways which offers routes in seven countries including australia thailand and china was on time and friendly but the planes cabin was in ratty
