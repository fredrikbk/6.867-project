big sale at uncle sams club warren ohio in many ways the commodity boom has been a double edge sword for jack pittano as manager of the warren regional depot for the defense national stockpile center at fort belvoir va mr pittano keeps his eyes on a huge hoard of mercury tannin manganese and other materials the u s government began stockpiling years ago as an "emergency cabinet" to build ships and tanks and outfit soldiers in world war ii the agency continued buying materials in the s and s just in case the cold war escalated and the u s was cut off from its supplies of metals and other goods from foreign sources now that stockpile is considered largely unnecessary as a result mr pittano is one of several managers charged with ridding temperature controlled warehouses of &# billion of metals contained in bags boxes and steel drums a job made easier with recent demand for metals to make goods around the world indeed with a global commodity boom in full swing many of the metals and other commodities held at the warren depot have increased in value zinc for example fetched &# a pound for the agency in fiscal almost twice the cents a pound selling price in fiscal germanium a rare metal used in semiconductors and fluorescent lights sold for close to &# a pound in fiscal the stockpile centers commodity sales topped &# million in fiscal the highest sales mark since and far exceeding the agencys &# million annual budget the excess profit is used to help finance military readiness programs and health care costs for military personnel about &# million raised mostly from the sale of tons of titanium went to the creation of the world war ii memorial in washington while buyers are clamoring for the metals and are willing to pay top dollar mr pittano has to be careful not to unload so much that he upsets the supply and demand balance and causes prices to tumble for example the warren depot has more than tons of tannin extract a leather tanning material made from ground tree bark which the u s government acquired from latin american countries in the s prices now range from &# a ton to &# a ton depending on the quality of the product if the depot sells it all at once it could cause prices to collapse and seriously impair the business of some latin american processors in fact after the agency sold tannin extract in argentine producers filed a lawsuit saying it was causing market disruptions now the agency sells only tons a year "we look at potential market disruption or undue market disruption with every sale we make " says essie schloss deputy administrator in virginia the stockpile center is "scrupulous" about preventing market overload " mr pittano has time congress ordered the agency to shut down by last year it closed warehouse locations mr pittanos warren depot will be only one of three staffed depots left as of sept "well continue with stockpiles till we go out of business " mr pittano says only three of the seven warehouses at the warren depot which stretches across acres have material in them the sprawling campus at warren is self sufficient in case of emergencies with its own backup water supply and electrical power most of the odd commodities are stored indoors but some heavy metals such as ferromanganese and chrome are stored outdoors stacked in orderly piles and labeled with signs telling the countries norway israel south africa where they were mined and purchased the warehouses are protected hours by armed guards and surrounded by barbed wire fences some areas those housing precious or dangerous materials such as flasks full of mercury are protected by laser beams workers drive beeping forklifts and minitractor trailers moving thousands of burlap bags full of tannin and stacked on pallets mr pittanos staff of nine not including four summer interns at the warren ohio facility maintain the hoard and process the sales of semitruck load batches of materials such as tungsten used for bullets talc foot powder for soldiers and feathers used in pillows as the head office in virginia and congress allows high value materials such as titanium natural rubber and copper have already sold out bringing in healthy revenues others such as asbestos bought years ago are more difficult to sell and must be deposited in a landfill or sold for a pittance the agency is hanging onto diamonds stored in a vault at a citibank in new york along with batches of mica quartz and beryllium "those materials are considered to be critical to national defense for one reason or another " ms schloss says congress ordered the release of the depots titanium to the abrams tank program several years ago the agency typically sells its metals to the private sector with titanium and steel companies sometimes buying metals for their furnaces or with large trading companies such as glencore international ag buying large lots of chrome manganese and other metals to resell to others a few years ago a sculptor from indiana bought several boxes of talc and loaded them into his trunk before selling to private customers the agency must conduct background checks to ensure the prospective buyer isnt a foreign government or a terrorist security staff check the vehicles drivers licenses and pickup documents of customers arriving at the warren depot they also inspect the trunk and other parts of the vehicle mr pittano carefully leads visitors into a warehouse with a warning on the door that says "caution mercury " he says there is no need to worry about the rows of steel drums holding metal flasks loaded with mercury a corrosive liquid metal used in some consumer goods but also dangerous when exposed to humans in large quantities "we store mercury better than anyone else in the world period " he boasts opening a drum to show how the flasks are stored and sealed multiple times "we know what wed have to do if an emergency came up " summer interns from area high schools who earn &# an hour at the depot dont get to work in the mercury area even if it is safe mr pittano says "i just dont want anything to come up " and despite the supposed safety of the depots mercury that material is being moved from warren and two other national stockpile center facilities to a government storage facility in nevada away from population zones such as new jersey where residents protested the mercury storage it is one of the few commodities the agency is not allowed to sell on the open market
