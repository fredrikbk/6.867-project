numbers of the student loans were in default the trustee also alleges a conflict of interest at pepper hamilton because the firm simultaneously represented mr yaos business and gagne family members who lent to it mr gagne referred calls to pepper hamiltons executive partner robert heideck who said the law firm acted appropriately and "denies each and every allegation " he said any conflicts of interest in pepper hamiltons representation of mr yaos firm called student finance corp or sfc were waived in writing by all concerned "when we learned that everything was not as it had been represented by sfc pepper insisted that sfc make immediate disclosure and take immediate internal corrective actions " he said "after it failed to comply we withdrew any further representation " mr gagne remains at pepper hamilton sfcs founder mr yao couldnt be reached he has pleaded not guilty someone who was his attorney until recently declined to comment his new attorney didnt return calls

the money was for repairing and maintaining his jets when shown a photo of himself and ms karlsen at the playboy mansion he said the cash was for "a movie project that didnt go anywhere " the federal indictment of mr yao last year accuses him of making false statements about these wire transfers in another deposition ms karlsen says that she dated mr yao for about four months in late and that the money was a gift "i dont know how to fly an airplane and i was never in the movies " she said in an interview mr yaos business model was simple his company sfc lent to students or purchased loans already made to them by their trade schools many of which taught truck driving sfc bundled the loans and sold notes based on them promising investors fixed returns that came via the repayment of the loans he could make money in part by buying the loans at a discount it seemed like a sure bet both for the banks that funded sfc and for note investors because the student loans carried insurance promising to repay them even in the event of fraud the insurer was royal indemnity co a u s unit of london based royal &amp sun alliance insurance group plc royal indemnity now contends in a suit against pepper hamilton that mr yaos business conspired with schools to make loans to students who were uncreditworthy and not employable as truck drivers the suit cites a memo in which an sfc manager told colleagues that some schools had issued loans to students with criminal records and physical or mental handicaps at some schools it says more than of loans werent repaid the trustees suit adds that sfc itself owned interests in some trade schools sfc soon faced a cash flow problem mr yao in a december email to mr gagne at pepper hamilton mentioned a "&# million shortfall" for the month mr yao asked if the man who had introduced the two of them mr gagnes uncle robert bast could "invest" that much in sfc to cover the gap the trustees suit says to mask high student loan default rates both the trustees suit and royal indemnitys suit say sfc sometimes made loan payments on behalf of the nonpaying students calling these "forbearance payments " mr gagne was "aware of sfcs practice of making payments to disguise student loan default rates from at least " says royal indemnitys suit the trustees suit cites an email from mr gagne to mr yao in february saying "you will just have to hit the school reserves in the normal course to fund the defaults " a year later in march mr gagne told mr yao that using company funds to make students payments could be viewed as "manipulating the loan pool performance " according to the trustees suit sfc not only continued the practice but increased it sfcs forbearance payments totaled &# million in &# million in and then &# million in the year leading up to sfcs june bankruptcy filing according to the trustees suit pepper hamilton is just one of a number of parties the trustee is suing the other litigant facing off against pepper hamilton insurer royal indemnity maintains it relied on "fraudulent" information from the law firm in agreeing to sell insurance to sfc royals suit says the law firm failed to disclose "ghost payments" that sfc made to mask defaults royal which itself used pepper hamilton as legal counsel in an unrelated matter argues that mr gagne and his law firm "were sfc insiders and had every incentive to ensure the success of sfcs fraud " mr heideck denies pepper hamilton has any culpability "apparently there were many people who were misled by mr yao " he said he also said that "royal was responsible for determining the adequacy of the loans it insured " despite sfcs troubles mr gagnes family and relatives continued to lend his uncle mr bast was the biggest family lender but they also included mr gagnes wife and family trusts of which mr gagne was a beneficiary their reasons for doing so havent been explained in the bankruptcy trustees suit says gagne family members lent sfc &# million that was later repaid with interest plus a "payoff premium " the interest rate itself varied from to on loans from the family the suit says mr heideck says was "at of below the market rate" for loans of that type sometimes mr gagne billed sfc to prepare documents for the loans and also signed them on behalf of his family members american bar association rules of conduct say lawyers shouldnt represent a client if "a personal interest" might limit their representation they also must not have "a business transaction with a client " but the aba rules make an exception if a transaction is fair to the client is spelled out in writing and is consented to by the client in writing mr heideck says that "every single conflict was waived by the interested parties " according to the bankruptcy trustees suit mr gagne twice sent mr yao conflict waiver letters and encouraged mr yao to retain separate counsel because of "inherent conflicts of interest " mr heideck says "we were confident mr yao signed whatever appropriate waivers there were or agreed to the waivers " the trustees suit says others at pepper hamilton should have known all wasnt right at mr yaos business in late the suit says sfc hired a risk management director named kirk monteverde who quit after two weeks saying that sfc had "misrepresented its financial position " the suit says pepper hamilton attorneys prepared a severance agreement for mr monteverde that paid him &# and barred him from disclosing details about his work at the company mr monteverde declined to comment without elaborating pepper hamiltons mr heideck said the "facts support our position and not the trustees " by early more difficulties at sfc prompted another injection of funds gagne family members and family trusts lent sfc &# million on march to "keep sfc financially viable long enough for the family to recoup their investments " the trustees suit contends it puts the total amount that the gagne family lent to mr yaos company at more than &# million two weeks later mr yao met with royal indemnity in delaware and told the insurer sfc had been making forbearance payments to keep student loans from being reported as in default royal says in its suit royal canceled the policies insuring repayment of the loans leaving sfc with scant ability to borrow more or attract new investors with sfc on the brink of collapse mr gagne sent a memo to his law partners on april telling them sfc had "lied" to its investors insurers and others and had destroyed executive committee minutes he said that no one at sfc "ever fully disclosed the use of the forbearance accounts" and that sfc officers lied about the issue in his presence excerpts of the memo are cited in both lawsuits against pepper hamilton mr gagnes memo suggested that pepper hamilton stop representing sfc and described the cascade of problems this step would cause first it would raise a cloud over sfc with both banks and investors making it hard for the company to survive and if it went under another pepper hamilton client royal indemnity would be responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid student loans "adding to the ethical considerations is the fact that members of my family and trusts in which i am a beneficiary have made loans" to sfc mr gagne told his partners he added "we need to recognize the possibility that this firm will be sued " he then took steps to make sure his family was repaid securing a personal guarantee from mr yao says the trustees suit mr yao emailed mr gagne on april "i will protect your familys investment in sfc notwithstanding any adverse outcome that may result " according to the trustees suit to help repay the gagne family mr yao pledged an interest he had in a chain of trade schools the next day pepper hamilton withdrew its representation of sfc the withdrawal led auditors to decline to endorse sfcs financial statements for on june mr gagne told his uncle mr bast a he had spoken with mr yao and "learned we will not be receiving the sfc checks for a while " two days later four trucking schools petitioned the bankruptcy court to force sfc to liquidate a process that is continuing last march federal prosecutors in delaware indicted mr yao on counts of fraud false statements and money laundering a trial is set for this march on some of the counts pepper hamiltons own day in court against the bankruptcy and insurance company suing it is scheduled for october
