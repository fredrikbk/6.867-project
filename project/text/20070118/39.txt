york washington d c boston san francisco and los angeles office markets according to the companys statement a flood of money from around the globe is creating higher values for local assets such as commercial real estate private equity funds like blackstone are absorbing cash from global investors and wall street continues to issue bonds secured against real estate that are in turn gobbled up by international hedge funds and insurers at the heart of the deal remains sam zell a year old investor and dealmeister who built up equity office over the decades from his perch in chicago known for a quick wit a collection of motorcycles and his blue jeans mr zell earned the nickname "gravedancer" for his proficiency at sweeping in like a vulture and buying distressed properties rehabilitating them and then selling them at huge profits after the bid from blackstone some investors wondered whether the deal indicated the top of the real estate market but mr zell himself has said he thinks the office markets will be on the upswing for at least another two years some of the nations most shrewd real estate players appear to agree with mr zell and then some vornado led by chief executive

called jmb realty once a formidable real estate presence in chicago but that faltered in the real estate downturn of the early s the deal underscores how small the financial world can be a young mr sternlicht worked for mr bluhm as an analyst at jmb from to when mr sternlicht established starwood mr bluhm was one of his original backers along with the ziff family john schreiber who was one of the founders of blackstones real estate group and still serves as an adviser to blackstone also worked at jmb and now finds himself on the other side of what will likely be a bitter takeover battle the group hasnt yet had access to equity offices books and to get that access it has to convince equity offices board it has the financial wherewithal to offer a superior bid that is a steep hurdle for what is the largest private equity deal ever but the group has lined up substantial financing from j p morgan chase &amp co lehman brothers holdings inc ubs ag barclays capital plc and royal bank of scotland perhaps the largest obstacle for the vornado group is blackstones "matching rights " which allow it to have the last look at any competing bid there are other obstacles as well the new bidders have to convince the board that an offer involving stock is as valuable as cash especially given the steep appreciation of vornado shares over the past twelve months also since the deal is subject to vornado shareholders approval the timing of any deal could stretch into months rather than the two weeks to closing for blackstone for its part the vornado group could decide to withdraw after doing its due diligence in a statement issued last night the eop board said it will consider the vornado groups proposal "as soon as practicable " the statement also said that the board has not changed its recommendation to merge with blackstone the shareholder vote remains feb looming over the proceedings is the state of blackstones relationship with j p morgan the two have had a tight bond over the past few years although j p morgan has generally not been involved in financing blackstones real estate deals helping "jump" the deal creates another fraught dynamic that wall streeters are watching a j p morgan spokesman declined to comment perhaps vornado was romanced by the idea of a second chance at the bride in the shareholder proxy equity office said that four suitors had flirted with a merger but none was willing to pay mr zells minimum price of &# a share until blackstone came through with its offer in november vornado was widely reported to have been one of those suitors mr
