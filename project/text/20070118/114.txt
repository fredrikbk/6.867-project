the morning brief wiretap reversal may appease but questions still remain the wall street journal online in a surprising reversal the white house said it would end the national security agencys controversial practice of domestic wiretapping without warrants one year after the secret program was disclosed and agreed to give an independent court jurisdiction over such surveillance measures in the future under the changes surveillance targeting people suspected of having links to terrorism will be conducted with the approval of the clandestine foreign intelligence surveillance court the change announced by attorney general alberto gonzales in a letter to senior members of the senate judiciary committee "appears to be a concession to mounting political and legal challenges to the program " as the los angeles times writes while the bush administration had been seeking congressional authority for the eavesdropping program "the chances of that happening in a democratic congress are considered slim " the l a times notes mr gonzaless unexpected announcement came ahead of his appearance before the senate judiciary committee today where he is expected to face hostile questioning on the program the new york times says and in two weeks a cincinnati appellate court is scheduled to hear arguments on the governments appeal of an earlier ruling declaring the program illegal and unconstitutional "the announcement today is welcome news " sen john d rockefeller iv d w va who leads the intelligence committee tells the times "but it is also confirmation that the administrations go it alone approach effectively excluding congress and the courts and operating outside the law was unnecessary " mr rockefeller says he intends to "move forward with the committees review of all aspects of this programs legality and effectiveness " other lawmakers also say they plan to keep pressing mr gonzales for details of the warrantless wiretapping program "while i welcome the decision to stop conducting surveillance without judicial approval the president now needs to respond fully to legitimate congressional questions " sen russell feingold d wisc said yesterday bloomberg adds indeed many questions remain including those about the programs new approach which remained unclear because officials declined to give specifics over details such as whether the administration will be required to request a warrant for each person it wants to monitor or whether the independent fisa court has issued a broader set of orders to cover multiple cases the washington post says the reversal also raises questions about the scope of president bushs power now that he faces a democrat led congress his administration "confronts a much different political landscape than it did five years ago democrats are vowing closer scrutiny of its use of executive power " as the l a times says and mr bushs decision to submit the wiretapping program to the authority of the fisa court "represents the latest step back from the expansive interpretation of executive power he has asserted since the sept attacks " the washington post explains commercial real estate heats up the market for office real estate in big u s cities is still hot and yesterday a consortium of investors led by vornado realty trust launched a bid to rival blackstone groups offer for equity office properties trust in what could be the biggest leveraged buyout in history vornados &# billion offer for equity office which tops an existing &# billion bid from blackstone reflects the growing appetite for office space in cities such as new york los angeles and san francisco where there has been little new construction to meet demand bloomberg notes while the prices of homes and condominiums are hurting a flood of money from global investors is helping to boost the value of commercial real estate private equity funds like blackstone absorb cash from investors and "wall street continues to issue bonds secured against real estate that are in turn gobbled up by international hedge funds and insurers " the wall street journal notes and while a &# billion bid may have been shocking a year ago today it may not be quite so surprising "it just seems theres no limit to the prices being paid " michael knott an analyst with green street advisors a real estate research and trading firm based in newport beach calif tells the journal ge wants abbotts diagnostics unit jeffrey immelt is clearly in the mood to deal just days after general electric bought the aerospace business of british conglomerate smiths industries and weeks after ge put its plastics business on the market the company is in what the financial times calls advanced talks with abbott laboratories to buy the u s health care giants diagnostics business for up to &# billion if the deal goes through it would "deepen the u s conglomerates focus on the medical care markets and underlines the companys determination to take radical action to revive its share price " the ft says "the talks are part of wide ranging efforts by ge to reshape its sprawling portfolio by selling low margin businesses and acquiring assets in faster growing markets " also of note los angeles times iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki promised in an interview to crack down on shiite muslim militias and sunni arab rebels warning that no one not even muqtada al sadr his political ally would be above the law and he said that once a military crackdown begins political negotiations will shut down the comments contrasted sharply at points with the bush administration which has called for continued political and economic negotiation washington post a bipartisan group of senators announced a formal resolution of opposition to president bushs buildup of troops in iraq calling for more diplomacy international cooperation and an "appropriately expedited" transfer of military responsibilities to iraqi security forces the nonbinding resolution which could come to a vote within two weeks moves congress a major step closer to a public confrontation with the bush administration over war policy guardian a taliban spokesman told afghan agents
