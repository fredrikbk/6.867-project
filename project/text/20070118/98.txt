politics &amp economics minimum wage deal hinges on taxes senate packages combination of sweeteners breaks sets up early test of ties with house washington some banks foreign companies and top corporate executives could feel the pinch of tax changes the senate is considering to fund sweeteners for small businesses as part of a federal minimum wage boost the senate finance committee yesterday approved an &# billion package of tax breaks over years for small businesses that may be affected by the proposed increase in the minimum wage the pay raise passed the house and could be taken up in the full senate as soon as next week the senate package extends for another year a deduction for small companies equipment expenses and allows restaurants quicker recovery of costs for improving their premises it also extends for five years a tax credit for companies that hire certain disadvantaged groups such as at risk youth the committee added veterans disabled during service on or after sept to the list of hires eligible for the credit pay raise haggling whats new a senate panel passed tax breaks for small businesses and tax increases for other companies that are likely to be attached to the chambers minimum wage legislation the issue the house passed a minimum wage increase without the tax breaks whats next senate and house democrats will have to agree on how to proceed if they want to complete action on the minimum wage the senate move shows the changed dynamic in the new congress where democrats have said fiscal responsibility and helping the middle class will be their focus rather than pairing the pay boost for low income workers with a cut in the estate tax as was the case last year the senate is combining the minimum wage increase with a narrow package of tax breaks for small firms that is offset with tax restrictions for other companies the debate is an early test of the ability of democratic leaders in the senate and house to bridge differences between the chambers to pay for the tax breaks the panel agreed to further restrict a tax shelter known as a "sale in lease out " or silo transaction the committee also agreed to collect taxes from more companies that have used "corporate inversion" deals to avoid them essentially reincorporating in a foreign country to avoid paying u s taxes on foreign income in addition the panel agreed to greatly limit the earnings that executives and other highly paid workers can put tax free into deferred compensation plans among other changes in congress cracked down on silo transactions but not as rigorously as today in silo transactions a tax exempt entity such as a city government sells property to an investor and then leases the property back for use the investor in turn can take advantage of tax breaks associated with the property that wouldnt benefit the seller the finance committees bill would raise an estimated &# billion over five years by restricting the deals no matter when they occurred current law disallows those that occurred after march among the losers if the change becomes law banks such as wachovia corp and bank of america corp that have entered into such transactions both companies declined to comment on the move the finance panels changes to corporate inversions would affect companies including drilling service contractors nabors industries ltd and noble corp that got a reprieve from such restrictions when congress debated them a few years ago at that time house republicans insisted on a later effective date for corporate inversion curbs than the senate wanted now the senate panels plan would move back the effective date about a year noble declined to comment and nabors industries didnt respond to a request for comment as for the changes to deferred compensation packages critics said the senate panels plan would have unintended consequences as written the provisions would cause an "upheaval " said lynn dudley vice president for retirement policy at the american benefits council which advocates for large companies that provide employee benefits ms dudley said the panels limits might affect compensation arrangements for middle managers not just top executives or could disrupt the common practice of providing two year severance packages in congress targeted companies that let executives defer compensation to delay paying taxes and then allowed them to dip into that kitty without limit it set rules some still being implemented by the irs detailing how and when compensation could be deferred requiring for instance a fixed schedule for paying out the money the new provision one of the first tangible responses to concern about executive compensation in the new congress would limit that to the lesser of &# million or the persons average taxable compensation for the prior five years finance committee chairman max baucus d mont said the offset provisions many of which had been passed by the panel in past years would rein in corporate abuses in order to help small businesses in states like his mr baucus said the tax package would be crucial to passing a minimum wage increase in the senate but the package faces resistance from tax writers in the house which last week passed a bill boosting the hourly minimum wage to &# from &# without any tax breaks the senates approach has rankled house ways and means committee chairman charles rangel d n y because it puts him in the position of having the senate initiate a revenue measure contrary to constitutional precedents that require all tax bills to begin in the house mr rangel appears to have staked out a bargaining position that senate democrats should at least first try to pass the wage increase without the tax breaks "why do you need a tax break to do the right thing " mr rangel asked "maybe he sen baucus doesnt have a strong feel for the depth of support that this bill has i strongly disagree that this thing would be filibustered " mr baucus said senate majority leader harry reid d nev and house speaker nancy pelosi d calif would have to work out the differences david rogers and valerie bauerlein contributed to this article
