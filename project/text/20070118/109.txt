tech start ups have money to burn but choose thrift when silicon valley entrepreneur bill nguyen launched two technology companies in the late s dot com boom seven networks and onebox they each went through about &# million a month the start ups hired hundreds of people and spent heavily on marketing and sales thats not how mr nguyen is using cash at his newest start up music web site lala com since getting &# million in venture capital funding in mid lala media inc has stashed of that money in the bank mr nguyen has hired just people for lala most of whom are engineers the palo alto calif company has spent little on marketing and sales its staff built some of the desks they use in the office and sometimes plays janitor in order to scrimp lala is currently burning through about &# a month says mr nguyen "when you got venture capital money previously many people thought you immediately needed to spend it by hiring or people " says mr nguyen "now we view the money as just an asset and not an immediate license to spend " stories like mr nguyens have become a defining element of a new tech boom that has some echoes of the dot com bubble while start ups in silicon valley and other entrepreneurial enclaves are once again proliferating they have a distinctly different approach to spending their cash past excesses were exemplified by start ups such as online pet store pets com inc which burned through &# million in and including spending an estimated &# million on advertising in venue likes the super bowl those dot coms typically staffed up quickly with dozens of new recruits and were known for lavish launch parties and other expensive marketing todays start ups by contrast often hire just one or two new staffers a month hoard their cash and find inexpensive ways to attract attention such as limited internet advertising and more reliance on word of mouth through web users the result start ups "burn rates" silicon valley parlance for how much cash a young company with little revenues and no profits is going through each month are noticeably lower than in the past indeed while tech start ups are raising less funding these days an average of &# million each time down from &# million in they are making the money last longer according to research firm ventureone tech start ups in silicon valley now survive an average of months on a single round of funding before needing to raise more money up from just months in ventureone is a unit of dow jones &amp co publisher of this newspaper all of this suggests that the current tech boom may play out differently than the dot com frenzy which ultimately ended in a swift and paralyzing crash in while many start ups will still fail those that have more money saved up are lasting longer than their dot com predecessors many of these companies may endure long enough to become profitable small businesses even if they never reach the stratospheric heights of a google inc or youtube so when a bust hits unlike the dot com crash it could shape up to be a more gentle decline with the impact more dispersed over time "any crash this time wont be as precipitous as in " says roelof botha a venture capitalist at sequoia capital and the former chief financial officer of electronic payments company paypal inc "because start ups arent going through cash at such a blistering pace that gives companies more time to figure out what works in their business " mr botha notes that the spending habits at his former company paypal are no longer emulated today paypal founded in and now owned by ebay inc was burning through about &# million a month in mid to maintain a staff of in total paypal spent &# million before it finally broke even "tech companies now take far less money to get to profitability " says mr botha aiding todays trend of start up parsimony are factors such as cheaper technology while start ups once spent millions of dollars on expensive computers and software many new companies can now instead exploit inexpensive server systems open source programs modifiable software that comes in free or inexpensive versions or web based services to build and launch their products whats more more start ups are now using cheaper labor overseas such as in india which lowers continuing operational costs dot coms also previously shelled out millions of dollars to sign up registered users to their web sites spending an average of &# on advertising sales and other promotions to get just one user say venture capitalists but with access to the internet now far more mainstream than in the late s start ups dont need to spend wildly to get attention from consumers "we can start super cheap these days " says seth sternberg a co founder and chief executive of meebo inc a web based instant messaging start up in palo alto when meebo launched in late mr sternberg recalls it took just a shoestring budget with four people who worked out of their homes "you just dont really need too many people anymore " now meebo which raised &# million in venture funding in december is spending about &# a month on its business and employees says mr sternberg more than half of the firms money remains in the bank he adds when the company held a party to celebrate its one year anniversary in september the shindig was held in an office parking lot to save money only tortilla chips water and soda were served meebo plans to announce a second round of funding of &# million today many venture capitalists right now are flush with cash to invest so some are giving bigger than needed chunks to start ups they also like to give more so start ups have enough socked away in case of an emergency the start ups that save are also finding their cash cushion gives them more time to tweak their products and business model munjal shah ceo of start up riya inc raised &# million in venture capital in and to nurture what was then a digital photo web site but while million photos were uploaded onto riyas site from users "we just couldnt figure out how to make money" from the idea says mr shah so mr shah has since put the photo site on the backburner to focus on riyas new business a visual shopping search engine called like com that launched in november like com makes a commission each time it sends an internet shopper to an e commerce web site and each time that site completes a sale based on that lead because mr shah has kept most of riyas money in the bank he says that affords him time to shift gears and overhaul his business plan "in the past many people raised enough money to just launch a product but ive raised enough so that we can go through three iterations " he says he adds that riya san mateo calif has enough cash to last till even if it doesnt generate any revenue meanwhile gibu thomas ceo of software start up sharpcast inc recently capped his companys work force at around people down from the original he planned to have thats because adding more hires would bump the companys burn rate up to &# million a month from &# a month now while sharpcast palo alto has raised &# million in venture funding and still has &# million in the bank mr thomas isnt ready to take any chances "cash is queen these days " says mr thomas who estimates sharpcast can last another two years even if it doesnt produce any revenue "fiscal discipline is harder to teach later in the life of a company and we want to be the last guy standing "
