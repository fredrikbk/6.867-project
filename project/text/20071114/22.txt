business world losing money is a crime remember the scandal that ensued after analysts fund managers and advisers put their clients money in google stock of course not there was no scandal because googles share price has gone up and up and up we offer this as corrective to the histrionics over the subprime meltdown similar to the histrionics after every financial "scandal " which have become so numerous in recent years that a new word is needed not scandal but just well risky stuff that didnt pan out a fund manager quoted in this paper wonders why wall street keeps "making the same mistakes" head slap why do traders bankers and fund managers receive big rewards this year for making bets and selling products that go bad the next laments a new yorker writer why do ceos get big exit packages when they leave under a cloud cries lawyer bill lerach on his way to prison in a washington post op ed that must be seen to be believed shooting the wounded is a pleasant pastime especially when it allows critics to presume they would have made better i e more virtuous decisions but look at it this way how many mortgages would have been found to be ill advised fraudulently documented or overpriced if the housing recession had come in rather than last year instead how many of these homeowners now are happily sitting on gains even amid the recent housing rout how many fund managers earned high returns on asset backed securities however exotic and illiquid in a crisis because there was no crisis how many financial ceos went to their gold watches smelling like a million bucks because the markets didnt turn on them for that matter what if enron had hit a business homerun that allowed it quietly to clean up its hidden liabilities gradually bringing them back on the books with big charges that analysts and the press would have laughed off with a cynical chuckle our goal isnt to justify fraud sloppy credit analysis or lazy investing capitalism is about risk taking and risk taking implies unhappy endings as well as happy endings happy endings have a way of covering up a lot of behavior that under other circumstances i e unhappy endings would raise an eyebrow if not land the perpetrator in jail a risky endeavor in its own right is a recent study by three business professors that tries to estimate how much corporate fraud goes uncaught authors alexander dyck adair morse and luigi zingales come up with an impressive conclusion that of public companies engage in some form of "material" i e of interest to investors lawbreaking each year wow but only a minuscule fraction fits the stereotype of self dealing by greedy executives most fraud they write "involves a misrepresentation of financial statements or breach of controls that was not motivated primarily by self dealing the bulk of these involve overstated revenue and revenue expectations " we enter an ethical minefield here but such findings perhaps shed light on why since time immemorial people have found it convenient and useful to treat capitalisms bad endings as "scandals" and good endings as evidence of virtuous character bluntly the real crime is losing money today fingers point at citigroup and merrill lynch not just for big subprime losses but inevitably over accusations of impropriety in how they disclosed those losses toss in the irony that "mark to market" accounting features its own censorious aspect requiring banks to don sackcloth over securities holdings because no one else will buy them or because rating agencies downgraded them even though the underlying payment streams may well be intact misplaced moralizing over business losses also infects the discussion of exit packages notice how these discussions substitute the language of reward and punishment for what really are matters of contractual relations and strategic before the fact incentives to wit merrill lynch ceo stan oneals severance is not a bonbon from a loving board but what the board feels legally obligated to pay him based on commitments made before the results of his tenure were known nor was he without proper incentives then or now his chief performance pay was merrill stock and his holdings are worth millions less than they were before the subprime losses emerged that wont satisfy mr lerach who thinks mr oneal should be imprisoned but nobody in his right mind would take the job on such terms given the risks entailed in running a modern business including the risk of civil or criminal litigation if things go sour indeed what towering pay in the risk taking professions really may be telling us is how utterly averse to risk taking ordinary human nature is the final manifestation is the argument that wall street has an "incentive" to sell bad products salesmen have an incentive to sell period investment advisers at the end of the day are losing your money not their own but buyers have incentives too caveat emptor thats what makes the system viable though viable is not the same thing as mistake free risk free or even fraud free hand wringing about the incorrigibility of wall street is of course a time honored shtick when markets turn south blame j k galbraith for establishing the tone of these sermons in his book "the great crash " still his emulators might try seeing our interesting world with their own eyes for a change
