when home builders hit the skids as troubled developers stop work buyers face lost deposits unfinished houses and crippling liens an ice rink in limbo the tumbling housing market is claiming a new class of victim customers of insolvent home builders in the latest sign of trouble ft lauderdale fla based levitt &amp sons a unit of levitt corp filed for chapter bankruptcy protection last friday citing the "sudden and steep" downturn in the florida housing market levitts move follows bankruptcy filings by a number of local and regional builders including neumann homes inc in illinois elliott building group in pennsylvania turner dunn homes inc in arizona and kara homes inc in new jersey many other builders simply close up shop and the situation is likely to worsen in the first half of next year says ivy zelman an independent housing analyst "were in the first or second inning " ms zelman says "there are going to be a significant number of insolvent builders " what a builders troubles mean for its customers can vary depending on factors such as state law contract terms and how long it takes to get the project back on track in some cases buyers may lose all or part of their deposit or wait a year or more for their house to be completed or the builders financial troubles to be sorted out homeowners whove already moved into a new development can find themselves living near a half finished house where work has been halted they also face other questions such as who will handle needed repairs what will happen to a promised swimming pool and whether contractors have put liens on their properties which could block access to financing in some cases local communities have stepped in to fix unfinished roads or pick up overflowing dumpsters jeff benes and maggie byrne paid &# for a four bedroom neumann home in antioch ill in now they are wondering what the companys bankruptcy filing will mean for property values not to mention who will plow the developments unfinished streets this winter and when the promised clubhouse pool and volleyball courts will be completed "were all up in the air now not knowing what is going to happen " says ms byrne as the housing market has slumped builders have struggled with rising inventories falling home prices and cancellation rates that have topped in some markets land prices have also dropped leaving builders owing more for some parcels than those properties are now worth banks meanwhile are tightening their standards not only for home buyers but for the builders as well indymac bancorp inc which lends to small and midsize builders said earlier this month that it expected of its home builder loans to be delinquent by the fourth quarter the company says that it stopped making new construction loans to builders in august during the early s housing downturn some of home builders went out of business according to the national association of home builders the number of bankruptcy filings was very small says nahb research director gopal ahluwalia most troubled builders simply shut their doors or moved into other ventures no one currently tracks builder bankruptcies he says often builders problems are evident long before any public filing before kara homes filed for chapter bankruptcy a year ago construction crews at its horizons at birch hills development in old bridge n j began disappearing and vendors who had worked on the development were replaced by others who seemed less experienced says homeowners association president frank ramsom kara employees also "started to neglect meetings" and provided "cryptic" answers to homeowners questions he says perry m mandarino who was brought in to serve as the chief restructuring officer for kara homes advises people buying a new home to "drive past it every few days or every week not just on a saturday " to check on construction "the warning signs are real obvious " he says "theres a lot of construction and all of a sudden it stops theres inclement weather and they are not boarding up the property " for buyers who are under contract the biggest risk is that they will lose their deposit some states such as california require that homeowner deposits be held in escrow or that the builder post a bond but in other cases the builder may be able to tap the money which may make it harder to recover when turner dunn filed for chapter protection last year more than homeowners had outstanding deposits ranging from &# to nearly &# according to bankruptcy filings turner dunn had disclosed in a public report given to buyers that deposits would be used to fund construction and were not being held in escrow says mary utley a spokeswoman for the arizona department of real estate its not yet clear how much of that money will be returned dan collins an attorney for the bankruptcy trustee says the outcome will depend on future litigation under federal bankruptcy law homeowner deposits take priority over certain other unsecured claims but only amounts up to &# are covered one homebuyer brett angner put down about &# on a turner dunn home he was purchasing as an investment he calls his chances of getting his money back "minimal " frontier homes inc an ontario calif builder that bought turner dunns assets offered buyers the chance to complete their purchases without an additional deposit "but it would have been imprudent of us as businessmen to say heres your money back " says frontier senior vice president michael dwight buyers who still want to move into their homes can find themselves living in limbo one couple waited three years for their &# million kara home to be completed "this woman and her husband had twins " says mr mandarino "they had to live with a relative " another issue who will handle the inevitable problems that come with new construction builders often provide third party warranties but neumann homes told buyers it would cover defects that appeared in the first year itself homeowners are concerned that the company wont honor that warranty says dennis crosby a trustee for antioch ill residents are grappling with other uncertainties each year neumann has installed a ice skating rink in its antioch development but some residents arent sure they want to pick up the roughly &# tab this year or if they have the authority to stop it says mr crosby who owns a neumann home village officials say they expect any developer who takes over the project to complete the clubhouse swimming pool parks and other promised amenities ken neumann the companys chief executive says that "its likely that the one year builder warranty will lapse " but adds that structural and major mechanical defects are covered by a year third party warranty mr neumann says money has been set aside in escrow to cover the cost of uncompleted amenities neumann homes is working with its lenders to get homes under construction completed he says for homeowners promised amenities can sometimes seem like pipe dreams at levitt &amp sons seasons at prince creek west in murrells inlet s c a gated community for residents and older a square foot community center with tennis courts indoor and outdoor pools computer rooms bocce court an arts and crafts room and health club is only partly completed "we were told that if it wasnt protected from the elements within days whoever picked up the project might have to knock it down and start all over again " says charles brindley a retired graphic artist who closed on a &# square foot home in the community in july many builders including levitt have also stopped paying their vendors those vendors in turn have placed liens on the homes of people living in the communities some levitt homeowners have as many as different liens on their home according to an executive at one of levitts georgia divisions such liens mean that the owner cant refinance get a home equity loan or sell the home other levitt homebuyers cant close on their properties because the builder hasnt been able to sign a sworn statement that it has paid off all subcontractors and suppliers paul singerman lead bankruptcy counsel to levitt says that since the filing the builder "is already trying to ameliorate a number of legitimate concerns " those include asking the court to allow it to resume home sales returning deposits posted after aug to certain customers and filing claims for the vendor liens so payments can be arranged in addition mr singerman adds under the supervision of the bankruptcy court levitt will attempt to move ahead with a plan to either finish substantially completed homes or sell partially completed developments to another developer or investor levitt has about developments none of which are completely finished mr singerman says in some cases homeowners and local governments have stepped in to pick up some of the pieces after kara homes filed for bankruptcy residents of horizons at birch hill hired an attorney to represent them in the bankruptcy case and a maintenance man to fix common problems to keep the stalled project from turning into a health and safety hazard the town of old bridge n j pulled out foot dumpsters that had been left on the property sent in police for regular patrols and fenced in a hole that had been dug for a swimming pool "these people were left in one heck of a lurch " says old bridge mayor jim phillips for some homeowners the good news comes with the arrival of a new developer kara homes horizons at woodlake greens development in lakewood n j was bought by maplewood home builders in september the new builder says it is now working to fulfill its promise to complete the clubhouse in time for christmas and have the swimming pool ready by spring since maplewood took over "the tempo here has been terrific " says jim lithgow who bought a kara home two years ago and is president of the homeowners association "its a story of anguish and passion but now weve turned the corner " unfinished business as more builders flounder their customers can face the following issues buyers who havent yet moved in could lose all or part of their deposit or wait months for their house to be completed homeowners could find that liens have been put on their homes by contractors who havent been paid communities may have to wait for the completion of roads and amenities such as swimming pools
