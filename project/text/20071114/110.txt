scramble to ensure no writing goes on union seeks scripts to monitor any work signs of breaking ranks in the days before mounting a strike against hollywood studios film and tv writers did something that might be considered unusual in other labor disputes they completed and were paid for a lot of work that was delivered to the companies they were about to picket now the writers guild of america which represents the striking writers is scrambling to get copies of all the scripts turned in to studios over the past six months as part of an effort to police the use of nonunion labor to complete or polish union work so far however by most estimates the unions efforts to collect all of those scripts has fallen far short of its goal meanwhile in the strikes second week signs have emerged that some writers may be planning to break ranks some of the writers for at least one soap opera cbs corp s "the young and the restless " went "financial core " meaning they gave up their status as guild members this week with plans to return to writing according to a person close to the show other soap writers are considering following their lead or writing in secret to keep their jobs and their shows on the air this person said late last week the wga posted on its web site a phone number to report "strike breaking activities and scab writing" to the guilds person strike rules compliance committee the alliance of motion picture and television producers which negotiates on behalf of studios responded yesterday with a statement that said "asking members to inform on each other and creating a blacklist of those who question the tactics of the wga leadership is as unacceptable today as it was when the wga opposed these tactics in the s " soap operas face perhaps the most imminent peril during the strike their audiences have been shrinking for years repeats draw low viewership they rarely sell on dvds and there are few channels for internet distribution writers and producers in the genre fear that by the time the strike finishes their audiences wont return other writers extended their picketing yesterday to wall street where they demonstrated near the new york stock exchange against the media companies and the online strategies they have touted to investors writers argue they deserve a bigger piece of the digital revenue generated by their productions in advance of the strike which began nov writers scrambled to deliver scripts to their employers before the strike deadline dozens of film scripts poured into movie studios for example generating payments to writers that are contractually owed when a script is handed over a similar scenario played out in the television business to a lesser degree the result is a kind of only in hollywood moment on the eve of a possibly lengthy strike the studios put money in the pockets of the writers they are now trying to wait out and the writers provided raw material that could help the studios keep producing new material "its ironic that the industry is willing to pay out and do business until the last moment and it speaks to the core of their business and the leverage of writers " says jonathan cutler a labor expert and professor at wesleyan university in middletown conn at the same time he says writers are typically more invested in their product than other union workers so actually going out on strike is a much harder decision than for workers in other industries "i dont think you have a lot of auto workers who want to hurry up and finish the last few cars on the line " the effect of the script tidal wave was most pronounced on the film side where writers rushed scripts to the studios before the walkout began some were continuing rewrites of movies set to go into production in the next few months while others were new scripts that had been commissioned earlier by the studios but werent due for weeks or months in some cases according to people familiar with the matter studios and writers bounced drafts of scripts back and forth several times in the last pre strike days hoping to make them as production ready as possible some studios such as walt disney co paid fees to writers for script drafts that hadnt been completed with the promise that they would get finished when the strike ends the fees were paid in essence as a way of enticing writers to think about projects during the strike even if they arent writing once the material was delivered the studios cut checks to the writers many of those checks were mailed nov after the strike began and it was big money in the two weeks before the strike began for example general electric co s universal pictures paid out more than &# million to writers who delivered roughly scripts according to people familiar with the matter other studios were similarly inundated time warner inc s warner bros received more than last minute scripts while sony corp s sony pictures took in between and studio executives on the receiving end of these screenplays say the quality varied some were clearly rush jobs while others were closer to being camera ready the latter case is particularly risky for the guild scripts that are nearly ready to be shot could be polished later by nonunion writers hired by the studios if they reach a point where they need completed material to produce that possibility is the primary reason the writers guild has made a large issue of a process it calls "script validation " under the wgas strike rules the guild asked its members to submit copies of scripts to ensure that the material wasnt worked on or altered by the writers or the studios during the strike the deadline for guild members to turn in their work was this past friday the drive for script validation then became a tug of war between the studios and the guild with writers caught in the middle in the weeks before the strike many studios took issue with the policy telling writers not to turn their scripts in to the wga because the studios already owned some of the work in question and didnt want it turned over to the guild by yesterday the wga had received about scripts according to gregg mitchell spokesman for the wga west mr mitchell admits that the guild likely doesnt have all of the scripts it believes it is owed rebecca dana contributed to this article
