tax report get ready for possible refund delays congress gridlock on new tax bill could trip up irs the tax filing season may be off to a shaky start even before it officially begins internal revenue service officials warn that millions of people may face delays in having their returns processed next year and getting billions of dollars in refunds the problem congress still hasnt approved temporary relief for many people from the alternative minimum tax or amt a parallel system that operates under many different rules than the regular system some lawmakers predict congress probably wont take action until next month if so that could spell major trouble treasury and irs officials warn thats because it takes time for the irs to reprogram its computerized processing systems to reflect last minute changes made in congress says terry lemons an irs spokesman how long "up to weeks after the bill is signed into law " he says "the amt is not simple and these are not simple changes to our systems " "as we look at the upcoming filing season the potential exists for us to see a problem of greater magnitude than anything we have faced in the past " said linda stiff the irss acting commissioner in a recent speech she warned that the processing of as many as million returns "would be delayed " last week the house passed a wide ranging bill that includes temporary amt relief although the bill is viewed as must pass legislation it includes other items that arent expected to be accepted by the senate and president bush has vowed to veto the bill in its current form thus the final legislation is expected to be significantly different than the house version about four million people had higher tax bills for because of the amt that number would jump to about million people for the tax year if congress doesnt pass a relief bill among those most likely to be caught by the amt are people with large families who live in high tax areas especially new york city

tax year were zapped electronically to the irs that was up from in if the problem sounds familiar thats because it is last year congress waited until december to extend several popular tax provisions that had expired at the end of among these was the option to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes as long as you itemized your deductions lawmakers resurrected this provision and others and president bush signed the bill into law on dec but congressional action didnt come until well after the deadline for the irs to send its materials to the printer as a result claiming those deductions became unusually tricky one of the reasons many people eligible for the sales tax deduction didnt claim it according to a government report "what were facing with the amt this year is of much greater magnitude" than last years headaches says mr lemons of the irs "its a far greater number of taxpayers" who may be affected and "the delays in being able to file could potentially be much longer " whats more "millions of other taxpayers not involved in amt returns may also have their refunds delayed because of the backlog in processing other returns " says ms stiff the acting irs commissioner "we are worried " says tom ochsenschlager vice president taxation at the american institute of certified public accountants congress "is really putting the irs in a box on this issue thats going to make a lot of taxpayers upset " while taxpayers who owe money typically wait until april to file and pay millions of people fire off their returns early each year in order to get their refunds an irs spokesman says more than million returns had been filed through march of this year about two thirds of all taxpayers typically get refunds each year the average refund this year was more than &# makers of popular tax preparation software including intuit inc s top selling turbotax say their versions will go on sale in retail stores soon naturally the turbotax versions will be based on current law not on estimates of what congress might do but turbotax officials say their computer systems are fast enough to make online changes soon after congress decides what if anything to do still that wont do tax filers much good if theyre waiting for their refund early next year and the irs system isnt yet ready to process their return the house votes to extend a tax
