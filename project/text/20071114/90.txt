our voluntary tax code should we stop worrying and learn to love the "mother of all tax reform plans" put forward by house ways and means committee chairman charles rangel of new york the bill would raise taxes by &# trillion over the coming decade according to louisiana republican rep james mccrery a committee colleague of mr rangels making it the largest tax increase in history there has been so much concern that such a tax increase would hurt financial incentives that drive economic growth that house speaker nancy pelosi distanced herself from mr rangels plan almost as soon as he announced it but fear not as mr rangel wrote on this page two weeks ago his bill would "restore a sense of equity and fairness that is critical to the success of our voluntary tax system " thats right he called our tax system "voluntary " that means we dont have to worry about the incentive effects since we wont actually have to pay any of that &# trillion unless we want to so when april comes around i encourage you to be like herman melvilles bartleby and say "i prefer not to " but wait by april youll already have paid since taxes are involuntarily withheld from your paycheck nothing can be done about that even if you dont volunteer to file a tax return and if you dont file a return youll find yourself involuntarily in jail youll then have to yield to the opinion that mr rangel wasnt being entirely straightforward in writing that our tax system is voluntary but then he wasnt being entirely straightforward in writing that his bill which would further raise taxes on the "rich" who already pay the great majority of federal taxes has anything to do with equity and fairness perhaps from mr rangels perspective our tax system is indeed voluntary after all he chooses who pays taxes how much they pay and how their money gets spent if he wants to raise our taxes to support a &# million earmark to create a charles b rangel center for public service at the city college of new york he can volunteer to do that but the rest of us have no such choice to be fair our tax system is indeed voluntary in certain respects for example wealthy liberals like warren buffett who call publicly for higher taxes on the rich in the name of fairness can volunteer to pay more themselves any time they wish to do so all mr buffett has to do is send a check to department g thats g for "gift" at the bureau of the public debt in parkersburg w va why not try an experiment in which the tax system is made truly voluntary already states as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico raise revenues with lotteries through which citizens voluntarily paid &# billion last year its a long and noble tradition before the birth of christ the han dynasty ran lotteries to raise the revenues used to build the great wall of china government could be entirely financed by voluntary taxation yes the government would have to be small enough to make do and citizens would have to be sufficiently public minded about it but all original american colonies ran lotteries and playing them was considered a civic duty proceeds from lotteries established harvard yale columbia dartmouth princeton and william and mary and paid for the cannons that defeated england in the revolutionary war but today mr rangel might find that the volunteerism in todays tax system is a dangerous thing his bill would raise the tax rate on capital gains income but the cap gains tax is voluntary to the extent that one doesnt have to pay it until one chooses to sell an appreciated asset that fact is not lost on mr buffett who believes the rich should pay more taxes but who has never volunteered to sell even one share of his vast holdings in berkshire hathaway and thus has never volunteered to pay any cap gains taxes what if every investor did that its nice to imagine a nation of long term investors just like mr buffett but if stockholders never sold any of their investments the economy incomes and job creation would slow to a crawl because a growing economy depends on capital moving freely and continuously to its perceived highest and best use mr rangel should also bear in mind that taxes on labor income are voluntary in the sense that one can choose not to pay them by choosing not to earn any labor income that is by not working all the rich need to do in order to make true mr rangels characterization of our tax system is to retire to their yachts rather than continue to contribute to the economy by running hedge funds or doing private equity deals when that happens mr rangel will get a lesson in supply side economics hell never forget some say that the laffer curve is wrong and that tax cuts dont result in higher tax revenues but when americas most productive workers stop working even a little bit in reaction to the incentive effects of the "mother of all tax reform plans " theyll see that the laffer curve was right after all and that it can cut both ways involuntary tax hikes result in voluntarily lower tax revenues mr luskin is chief investment officer of trend macrolytics llc
