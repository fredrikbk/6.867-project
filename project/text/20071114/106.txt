russian oil firms reap little benefit from prices despite high crude prices russian oil production growth may be damped because the countrys tax regime deprives producers of the bulk of export revenues while rising costs mean companies struggle to invest in new fields "we dont gain much from high oil prices " said a spokesman for oao rosneft russias largest oil company by volume his counterpart at second largest company oao lukoil agreed "high oil prices have only a marginal positive effect on the company in reality its the stabilization fund which gains from the high price of crude " the state funnels most of the profits from oil prices above &# a barrel through export and extraction taxes into its stabilization fund russian oil companies pay income tax and then production taxes based on the market price of oil as a result the companies are left with about of their upstream profits still both lukoil and rosneft are better off than some because they refine of their output the strengthening of the ruble against the dollar is also denting companies profits oil producers pay their taxes and operating costs in local currency but sell oil on international markets in dollars in lukoils case production is rising at a year but its capital expenditure almost doubled to around &# billion in from however profit can be better for those companies that also have greater refining capacities with the tax burden highest on crude being exported subsidies for domestic refineries leave companies with higher downstream capacity much better placed "internationally refinery margins have little to do with oil prices but because in russia export duties on crude and refined products are set differently with a gap this gap goes up in dollar terms as oil prices go up " said ronald smith chief strategist at alfa bank in moscow at &# a barrel the companies with refining capacity "are making &# &# a barrel just out of the taxation differential its four times higher than what would be considered good in the west " this differential divides russias major oil companies into two categories lukoil and rosneft which refine about of their oil are much better positioned than surgutneftegaz and oao tatneft with bp plcs russian venture tnk bp somewhere in between even so as the companies are working their refinery capacities flat out they find it difficult to finance new projects the tax regime was developed many years ago when oil was at &# to &# a barrel and the assumption was that it cost &# to develop a barrel of reserves a ratio of the total cost of oil field exploration divided by the volume of reserves with oil at &# to &# a barrel it costs &# to &# to develop a barrel mr smith said "the only way the companies are still making money is by extensive development of existing fields because this doesnt require them to build oil fields from scratch " said mr smith "because the upstream profitability is so low if you are going to develop a new greenfield project in say western siberia you are going to lose money whatever the oil price is " sergey donskoy director of the economy department of russias natural resources ministry didnt agree "the companies still have enough money to invest in new projects " he said last year russia gave tax holidays to the companies developing new projects in eastern siberia in order to fill a planned million barrel a day pipeline to china the regions crude production now stands at barrels a day mr donskoy also said that the ministry is studying the possibility of easing taxation for oil deposits on the continental shelf he pointed out that the current tax regime gives tax breaks for some depleted fields and heavy oil projects where oil production is more expensive lukoil is already producing heavy oil and tatneft signed a deal with royal dutch shell plc in september to produce heavy oil in the volga region however alfa banks mr smith doesnt see that as enough "the current tax regime is unsustainable and will change sometime over the next three years " he said it wont be easy to change though the current taxes are easy to collect and cutting the tax burden for oil companies might prove to be politically difficult ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections due in december and march
