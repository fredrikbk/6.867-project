trading up when to replace your long term care policy so youve got a long term care policy congratulations now consider dumping it one of the biggest knocks on long term care insurance which pays for costs such as assisted living nursing homes and home health care that medicare and other insurance generally dont is that many policies were wildly underpriced when they were first sold causing insurers to push premiums much higher in recent years in florida where to long term care insurers have written policies roughly half seek rate increases in any given year according to state insurance officials meaning many of floridas long term care policyholders routinely are hit by higher rates but such rate increases are rare with newer policies largely because of model legislation written by the national association of insurance commissioners imposing more stringent standards that effectively reduce insurers profits when they seek rate increases the legislation adopted by many states in recent years means new policies tend to be priced more appropriately and insurers generally havent needed to increase rates so should consumers who routinely confront rate increases replace their current long term care coverage with a new policy "that would be a reasonable consideration" for some policyholders says peter katt a fee only insurance adviser in mattawan mich sandy praeger the kansas insurance commissioner and president elect of naic agrees saying that baby boomers who already have a long term care policy "ought to at least take a look" at whether a better policy is available in replacing an existing policy you might also pick up some additional benefits not standard with older policies such as access to a broader sweep of care providers as well as reduce the likelihood that youll be hit with continued premium increases your rates will likely be somewhat higher but do you want a greater likelihood of stable rates or the risk that your premiums will keep going higher this strategy isnt for everyone for one thing youre older now and that will add to the cost since long term care polices have been growing more expensive moreover if your health has deteriorated you may no longer be insurable so dont drop coverage until you check with a long term care planning specialist still healthier consumers in their s and s may do well by shopping for new coverage as the trend of sometimes steep rate increases on older policies "is something that could continue to occur " says dave simbro a vice president at northwestern mutual life insurance co which has never raised rates whether youre buying a new policy or replacing an existing one heres what to look for in a new long term care policy low prices dont always signal the best deal the rate increases policyholders routinely struggle with are proof the primary consideration find an insurer that has both an a rating or better and which has a large book of business in long term care says joe celano president of intrx healthcare a long term care planning firm in new orleans plenty of well regarded insurers exist but not all do much long term care business because of that they may not price policies appropriately and if they ultimately exit the business as many have done you may face a greater likelihood of rate increases under the new insurer re evaluate your needs you may not need all the bells and whistles youre paying for some long term care insurers have created new more affordable bare bones policies that still provide basic coverage and use an ltc planning specialist not all financial professionals including insurance agents understand long term care look for designations that include clu chartered life underwriter chfc chartered financial consultant and cfp certified financial planner question them about how well they understand long term care and talk to more than one if you cant replace your policy for whatever reason yet cant afford the rate increase dont drop your policy instead "talk to your insurer about the things that can mitigate the impacts of the rate change " says randy rohrbaugh a deputy commissioner in pennsylvanias insurance department which sees numerous rate increase requests every year almost all on older policies you can reduce daily benefits shrink the period of coverage from say lifetime to three to five years increase the so called elimination period the time in which you pay the care costs from or days to days or even a year or alter the inflation protection so that daily benefits grow at simple rates not compounded if you still have to drop your policy check if your policy has a nonforfeiture clause not all do this ensures the premiums youve paid in arent wasted generally youll get daily benefits equal to the amount of premiums you paid into the policy before dropping it jonathan clements is on vacation the abcs of ltc must haves in a new policy quality insurer seek a rating of a or better and many billions in assets inflation protection benefits should grow whether at compound or simple rates of inflation appropriate coverage match your benefit needs to local care costs which vary widely
