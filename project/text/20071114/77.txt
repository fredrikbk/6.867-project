music of the weimar republic and more at this festival berlin in lights carnegie hall through sunday www carnegiehall org new york berlin rebuilding and redefining itself as europes most dazzling capital is the nominal centerpiece of carnegie halls "berlin in lights" festival which continues through sunday and those festival lights have shone all over the arts map with events ranging from programs of mahler and contemporary symphonists by the berlin philharmonic under its music director sir simon rattle to film screenings multimedia exhibitions and panel discussions on berlins literati and contemporary visual arts in an article in the festival program clive gillinson carnegie halls executive and artistic director and guiding force behind "berlin in lights " observed that "programming of this kind is not about forgetting the past its about making the past help drive the future " three festival concerts i attended seemed to illustrate this premise at least in theory first was the scintillating opener max raabe and the palast orchester in a characteristic program of film dance and cabaret music of the weimar republic as a performer mr raabe is panache incarnate his hair brilliantined to a polish that p g wodehouse would admire his tuxedo immaculately tailored his wing collars and shirtfronts magnificently starched no wash and wear formal togs for this gent delivering a running commentary laced with irony and innuendo and singing in a voice ranging from dusky baritone to sweet tenor croon mr raabe re created along with his versatile band an evening of classic numbers that suggested the trans atlantic give and take between american and austro german songwriters when art deco was the last word whether delivering mischa spolianskis sultry "heute nacht oder nie" "tonight or never" nacio herb browns "singin in the rain" in the original dance band arrangement from long before gene kelly flapped his umbrella around it or such a comic novelty song as walter jurmann and bronislaw capers "mein gorilla hat ein villa im zoo " the musicians had this infectious sometimes hysterical style down pat from kurt weills cynical "alabama song" to robert stolzs "du bist mein greta garbo " they played not only with perfect phrasing and color but with authentic articulation of the irresistible rhythms if light music seeks its "original instrument" group this is it indeed so complete was the evocative power of this ensembles music that we seemed transported back in time to the ballroom of berlins hotel adlon or was it the first class dining room of the cunard liner berengaria ex imperator of the hamburg america line those were the days the musical atmosphere darkened considerably a few nights later when zankel hall played host to the celebrated composer conductor and chansonier h k gruber singing and conducting a program of songs and instrumental music by kurt weill and hanns eisler that revealed the other side of the social coin weill of course is best known for his musical satire "the threepenny opera " a modernization by bertolt brecht of john gays english satire "the beggars opera " a pupil of the formidable pianist music theorist and composer feruccio busoni he later migrated from berlin to new york where he became a masterly composer of such broadway successes as "knickerbocker holiday" and "one touch of venus" before his sudden death his "street scene" won the first tony award for best score in eisler a pupil of arnold schoenberg also hooked up with brecht in the s collaborating on songs and theater works that viewed life from the perspective of berlins working poor and demimonde fleeing nazi germany in eisler went from moscow to the u s where his communist sympathies eventually got him blacklisted in hollywood and subsequently deported in despite the support of such friends as charlie chaplin and aaron copland back in east berlin he continued to write film and theater music as well as cabaret songs and the east german national anthem nevertheless with age he began to drift away from rigid communist politicos and suffered increasingly from depression the evenings repertoire all composed between and was entirely contemporaneous with that of mr raabe but instead of bubbling with suave irony and humor these protest songs exploded with bitter cynicism and anger weills "berlin im licht" doubtless the inspiration for the festivals title set the tone of the evening its text by the composer asserting that sunlight isnt enough to see what really goes on in weimar berlin you need wattage "just shut up and lets have some light " the song declares weills "mussel from margate" from "oil music" starts off like an old british music hall number about a margate vendor of painted shells but before long the refrain of "shell shell shell" takes on a chilling prophetic note as the text changes to a denunciation of the international petroleum industry particularly resonant today like weills songs eislers "ballad of good deeds " "storm troopers song" and "welfare song" declaim truth denounce wrong and exhort listeners to action in an idiom of infectious march waltz and tango rhythms and catchy refrains indeed the succession of numbers increasingly emphasized the similarity between eislers music in this genre and weills they often seem to write with the same pen mr gruber rumpled and bespectacled is a genuinely endearing concert figure like a favorite professor flipping through his sheet music occasionally dropping a page and linking his numbers together with a lively commentary that mingled vivid history with personal anecdotes rolling his gutteral prussian rs with gusto he sang in an indescribable blend of nasality and hypertensive stridency but if truth be told the delivery became wearisome by the second half the final work weills nonvocal "threepenny opera" suite "kleine dreigroschenmusik fur orchester " came as a genuine balm for these ears it was certainly well played under mr grubers direction by the zankel band mr gillinsons image of "the past helping to drive the future" was also in my mind during a very long zankel hall program of relatively modern works by the member ensemble knm berlin formed in the late s by a group of students of the hanns eisler college of music in then east berlin knm which stands in german for berlin new music ensemble devotes itself to music theater pieces as well as experimental music which means "anything goes " nearly all the composers represented were born between the late s and the mid s which places most firmly in middle age and a succession of works variously featuring the pleasant clicks of a bicycle wheel prerecorded waves of massed speaking voices paired violins playing octaves in quartertones megaphones muted with toilet plungers a video of street scenery a solo tuba in one work and a solo double bass bassoon in another each playing high tones low tones breath tones and mechanical noises of the instrument that were electronically doodled with grew old fast in fact despite the festival literature acclaiming knm as a "cutting edge" group most of these experiments recalled work done decades ago by john cage charles wourinen morton feldman and george crumb nevertheless if the cutting edge often sounded like it needed some honing two works truly stood out in selections from his continuing series "voices and piano" composer peter ablinger b took recorded speeches by brecht schoenberg angela davis and mao zedong and created piano accompaniments that closely follow the verbal pitches and cadences of the spoken words the result was sparkling vivacious keyboard music that recalled some of the american composer conlon nancarrows wonderful pieces with player pianos at unplayable tempos in the case of angela davis and chairman mao the piano translations strikingly revealed the essential musicality of their speech nevertheless because the piano music admirably performed by benjamin kobler was played simultaneously with the recorded voices one couldnt always hear what the speakers were actually saying might one suggest playing each speech unaccompanied before combining it with the piano and helmut lachenmanns "interieur" proved refreshing and exhilarating a virtuoso exploration of drums tom toms timpani gongs cymbals triangles xylophones and related percussion it was a magical sonata of pitches complex rhythms and dazzling timbres in several contrasting movements played with aplomb by dirk rothbrust it proffered genuine musical beauty mr scherer writes about music for the journal his new book is "a history of american classical music" sourcebooks
