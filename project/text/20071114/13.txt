biofuel funds are taking off global financial firms are muscling into renewable fuels with commodity funds and underlying indexes based on bio energy feed stocks as crude oil prices rise and interest in ethanol increases "big funds are becoming more creative sophisticated and diversified and looking for the next light bulb invention " said sergio alvarez senior vice president at hencorp futures lc in miami "it seems that with crude at close to &# a barrel that invention and that future is in bioenergy " biofuels got off to a slow start "lets remember that it took brazil to years of investments and uphill battles to get to where they are today in the flex fuel industry " mr alvarez said brazilians now drive their cars on gasoline mixed with home grown sugar cane based ethanol and local mills export ethanol at a brisk pace mr alvarez said "rallies we had in corn sugar and crude oil in and were very speculative in nature but since then theres been a bit of decoupling between the markets " crude oil has strengthened this year corn has been down and up while sugar has lagged behind with more biofuel funds being launched in the meantime open interest in sugar corn and oilseeds has risen in recent years said yoko sadamoto sugar trader with optrize traders house inc in new york "speculators interested in alternative fuels who want to spread out their risk and not just buy individual commodities or stock in companies that make ethanol or biodiesel are attracted to funds that concentrate on biofuels " she said u s futures exchanges chalked up record corn wheat soybean and sugar volumes in and partly because of biofuel demand but more importantly because of electronic trading biofuel related commodity funds have sprouted as nations beyond brazil the u s and members of the european union look to renewable fuels to meet their energy needs diapason commodities set up three years ago by commodity investor jim rogers and based in switzerland and london runs the diapason global biofuel index fund comprised of corn sugar wheat barley rice lumber and rapeseed and soybean oil u s securities firm merrill lynch &amp co in october launched two indexes tracking raw materials used in biofuels the mlcx biofuels index weights commodities by production level and calorific potential and contains sugar corn soybeans barley rapeseed canola and soybean oil the mlcx biofuels plus index adds gasoline and diesel to those components to "reflect how current technology and infrastructure is more geared to blending biofuels with conventional fossil fuels than to offering a pure biofuel alternative " close investments a subsidiary of u k based close brothers group plc last month introduced a fund called the agricultural commodities trust investing in corn wheat sugar and soybeans close management sees food and biofuel needs and climate change as crucial drivers in agricultural markets the schroder alternative solutions agriculture fund launched in october has &# billion in assets under management now the luxembourg company points to strong fuel demand for corn and sugar and for palm rapeseed coconut and soybean oils and expects to see "others as the biofuel industry develops " biofuel funds invest in indexes or bunches of commodities usually tied to u s futures where liquidity is greatest traders said individual commodities are volatile but the negative correlation of commodities as a group to stocks can offset losses in other investments howard strauber u s floor trader for ice futures said "alternative fuels have whetted investors appetites and funds focused on them have captured money thats staying away from the stock market " he said alternative fuels "are in their early stages now and ethanol from corn and sugar is just the beginning we dont know what will be coming along next in terms of cellulosic ethanol or other new products " the sugar market wont rise in step with strong oil prices "which are a double edged sword benefiting the sugar industrys ethanol side but making the cost of shipping sugar prohibitive " mr strauber said as for grains eric brown a bank of america corp alternative energy industry analyst last week raised his corn forecast to &# a bushel and said in he expects cash corn at &# because of a reduced u s acreage outlook and "improved spot ethanol production economics " he projected u s ethanol demand for corn at billion bushels in up from mr brown however believes it is too early to own ethanol company stocks given considerable capacity due to come online in the next months tom early executive vice president and sugar expert at agricultural advisers promar international in virginia said "everyone loves biofuels right now " but he noted exxon mobil corp s recent projection that by alternative fuels will provide just a fraction of world energy needs comments from exxon chief executive rex tillerson indicate the company is the only oil giant not planning to make biofuels on a large scale anytime soon in its nov energy outlook exxon mobil said renewable sources biofuels wind and solar will expand rapidly because of government subsidies and mandates but that those sources only represent of world energy use now and should account for by a commodity desk trader in florida said "how well the biofuel funds will do is a coin toss " investing in a basket is less risky than in a single commodity but "one thing i can tell you is that huge volatility in commodity markets will directly impact the funds returns in commodities it isnt a matter of losing or annually anymore it will be a matter of making or losing that much or more monthly " meanwhile as interest in biofuel funds increases "funds are getting more involved with the physical commodity in some cases receiving and delivering the physical product " with former commodity traders now running funds the desk trader said physical product ownership makes funds able to affect a market "sometimes moving prices in the direction of their long or short position " he said the u s outdistanced brazil in to become the top ethanol producer world wide while the european union is a leading biodiesel producer according to the international monetary fund china and india intend to increase biofuel production but experts worry such plans will aggravate food and water shortages in those heavily populated nations
