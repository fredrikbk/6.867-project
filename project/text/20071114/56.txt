guerrillas in the mist in a modernizing mexico blasts reveal shadowy side rebel strike at pipeline raises costs questions underground since oaxaca mexico on may somewhere in central mexico two middle aged mexican men vanished a week later a shadowy marxist guerrilla group that had been dormant for a few years issued the first of communiques identifying the men as their "comrades " the popular revolutionary army or epr blamed the mexican government for their abduction "they were taken alive and we want them back alive " the communique said above the statement were blurry photographs of the pair one a burly mustachioed man named gabriel cruz sanchez and the other edmundo reyes whose spectacles and tie gave him the mien of a mild mannered bank manager the guerrillas warned of dire consequences if the men were harmed but no one paid much attention that changed on july and again on july when the epr blew up natural gas pipelines belonging to state oil giant petroleos mexicanos cutting off gas supplies across central mexico on sept the epr struck again setting off simultaneous explosions on gas pipelines as flames shot up hundreds of feet in the air thousands of mexicans fled their homes the attacks cut gas supplies for days to some companies idling plants of nissan motor co honda motor corp and others the bill in lost economic output was about &# billion according to canacintra mexicos leading manufacturers association the epr has vowed to continue its campaign until its two comrades are returned mexican officials say they believe another attack may be imminent but there is a fundamental problem nobody seems to know what happened to the two men the government denies holding them the epr doesnt know who has them either judging by its communiques that shift blame from one government entity to another such a mystery is wrapped within a larger enigma who is the epr and what role does it have to play now decades after most other marxist groups have laid down arms mexico has made huge strides in the past two decades it opened up its closed economy and signed a free trade agreement with the u s and canada it scrapped years of one party rule under the institutional revolutionary party or pri for what is today a functioning democracy it is now the u s s third largest trade partner producing everything from cars to refrigerators but sometimes breaking through the apparent modernity is an undercurrent of violence and mysterious subterranean allegiances the so called "mexico bronco " or untamed mexico spinning conspiracy theories is a favorite pastime here and the epr affair has generated many some suggest the group is being used to further the ends of drug lords or even the government itself more than posing a parlor game riddle though the eprs resurgence presents big political and economic challenges president felipe calderon already has his hands full trying to wrest back control of large areas of mexico from powerful drug cartels now he must deal with this unexpected guerrilla resurgence in a political atmosphere that still simmers with anger over last years closely fought election lost by a hair by left wing populist andres manuel lopez obrador the eprs campaign also exposes the vulnerability of mexicos natural gas infrastructure state oil company pemex was so stunned by the july attacks that it took several days to publicly acknowledge them natural gas is already in short supply in mexico which supplements its production with expensive imports from texas vitro sa a monterrey based glassmaker says the epr attacks halted production for a week a &# million stoppage that drove the company into the red for the third quarter the epr has not attacked the countrys oil supplies but the possibility worries the government mexico is the worlds sixth biggest oil producer and a major supplier for the u s in nigeria armed groups who want more control over oil resources have used sabotage to cut the countrys oil output by one fifth the bombings show too how mexicos once feared security agencies have lost their edge after the pri was ousted in the incoming government of president vicente fox distrusted the spies it had inherited mexicos main intelligence agency known by the acronym cisen was neglected officials say its possible the missing men are victims of infighting but former guerrillas and analysts call that unlikely pointing out that on previous occasions when the group executed its dissidents it took public responsibility for applying "revolutionary justice " no such claim has been made this time some security officials say powerful drug lords could be using the epr either working with them or manipulating them to distract the government in its battle to reclaim territory from their well armed gangs but officials concede there is no hard evidence of a drug link before the guerrillas took credit for the pipeline attacks mr lopez obrador the losing candidate in last years election challenged the eprs involvement and accused the government of using the attack to divert attention from other political problems a more ominous theory which the government adamantly denies is that mexican security forces captured and killed the two men mexico already lived through a "dirty war" period in the s when hundreds were killed by security forces any return to those tactics would blacken the reputation of mr calderon and mexicos young democracy "there wont be any dirty war " says mexico attorney general manuel medina mora little is known about one of the missing men edmundo reyes "i know he loved the atlanta braves and novels by gabriel garcia marquez " said his daughter nadin reyes a year old kindergarten teacher who lived with her father until he disappeared this summer her father moved years ago from mexicos poor southern oaxaca state to mexico city where he ran a mom and pop store in a sprawling working class neighborhood ms reyes said in an interview she has since left mexico according to the director of a human rights organization which has taken up her fathers case the other man year old gabriel cruz sanchez bears a name that has been tied with marxist rebellion in mexico for nearly four decades much of the history of the epr and of its predecessor groups also appears to be that of the cruz sanchez family the missing mans older brother tiburcio cruz sanchez is believed to be the leader of the epr according to government officials and intelligence documents about the group reviewed by the wall street journal gabriel and tiburcio were the sons of a deeply religious furniture store owner in the city of oaxaca says their sister margarita cruz a podiatrist who still lives there the brothers came of age at a time when many people throughout mexico were inspired by the cuban revolution and angered by a mexican government massacre of students they helped form the clandestine revolutionary workers union of the people known by its spanish initials procup in the early s the group ambushed police and army troops in the states of oaxaca and neighboring guerrero kidnapping officials and setting off the occasional bomb in urban areas mexicos guerrillas looked up to cuba which supported revolutionaries elsewhere in latin america but havana mindful that mexico was the only latin american country that never broke relations with cuba had a gentlemans agreement not to support mexicos militants "mexican guerrillas were never very good " says jorge castaneda a former mexican foreign minister who has written books on the latin american left "they were lousy in part because the cubans didnt train them " adopting a mao like strategy of "prolonged popular war" to reach power procup was nicknamed "the bombers" by other guerrilla groups who looked down on their unsophisticated interpretation of marxism and proclivity for setting off explosives "we thought their ideological foundations were pretty weak " says gustavo hirales a founding member of another guerrilla group the of september league in after a wave of bombings attributed to procup tiburcio and gabriel went underground "gabriel left one day and never came back " his sister ms cruz said in an interview she says she has no memory of the older tiburcio in clandestine movements as in much of mexican life family is paramount procup was dominated by a handful of oaxaca clans including the cruz sanchezes and another linked to it through marriage the canseco ruizes in tiburcio cruz sanchez had married florencia canseco ruiz the sister of two procup guerrilla leaders one of the brothers felipe canseco ruiz was a member of a procup propaganda cell in mexico city he says that after his sister went underground in comrades told him she belonged to another cell in the mexican capital but mr canseco ruiz says he never saw her now a lawyer mr canseco ruiz heads a tenants rights group in mexico city and denies any connection with the epr "only through peaceful means will we be able to achieve changes favorable to the poor " he says in his tiny office whose peeling walls are dominated by posters of che guevara and karl marx in many guerrillas surfaced to take advantage of a government amnesty that legalized the mexican communist party most procup members remained underground during the early s tiburcio emerged as the groups top leader exercising an iron discipline secretive skilled at martial arts and firearms he had a chameleonlike quality that enabled him to pass for a doctor or lawyer a former colleague says according to intelligence documents tiburcio has at least seven false identities nicknamed "the professor " he lived in mexico city for years under the name francisco cerezo telling people he taught philosophy at mexicos most prestigious university the unam the university said it was unable to comment on personnel matters his now missing brother gabriel was an explosives expert with a good sense of humor the former colleague recalls since the group carried out more than kidnappings which it calls "acts of expropriation" and amassed &# million according to intelligence documents in it kidnapped several mexican plutocrats including alfredo harp helu co owner of the countrys biggest bank banco nacional de mexico sa known as banamex mr harp was freed after four months in captivity when his family paid &# million according to ledgers discovered in a police raid joaquin vargas the owner of a media conglomerate was kidnapped in in a military style operation involving a dozen procup members masquerading as an elite police unit mr vargas was hustled into a car injected with a knockout drug and kept in a dark closet size room for days before his family secured his release "they are very professional " he said in an interview "they dont abuse you they dont cut off fingers within their lunacy they have a certain ethic " in the year that zapatista guerrillas launched a short lived rebellion in mexicos chiapas state the remnants of the procup and a few other groups came together to form the epr according to epr documents posted on cedema org an internet site of a group that researches latin american guerrilla groups in the epr used the first anniversary of a peasant massacre in guerrero state to make its public debut shooting ak s in the air and calling for a "peoples war " intelligence services say tiburcio was its leader the epr didnt respond to inquiries sent to an email address the group provided on its communiques over the next two years the epr launched a wave of attacks on military and police installations killing at least soldiers and police officers in oaxaca and guerrero hundreds of suspected guerrillas were imprisoned tiburcio may have recruited three of his four sons hector alejandro and antonio into the family business the trio was arrested in and charged with setting bombs on mexico city bank offices to protest the sale of banamex to citigroup inc charges against alejandro were dropped but two brothers are now jailed on charges related to the bombing alejandro and a fourth brother francisco say none of the siblings has anything to do with the epr and their brothers are being held as political prisoners to pressure their parents the two say they had no indication growing up that their parents could be guerrillas as the epr attacks continued mexico underwent a peaceful democratic transformation in after decades in power the pri lost the notion of guerrilla war appeared outdated the epr suffered a rash of splits intelligence officials and analysts say over interpretations of marxist doctrine as well as alleged misuse of ransom money a mexican intelligence report says the epr has executed of its own members a former colleague recalls an earlier power struggle in which he says tiburcio had three brothers from another family killed "dont use my name " says the colleague "those guys are armed and dangerous " following the u s terrorist attacks of sept the groups leaders feared that the u s central intelligence agency would hunt them down the epr contacted the mexican government seeking to clarify that they werent islamic terrorists but mexican revolutionaries who didnt attack targets outside the country according to a now former official who traveled for a day on helicopter jeep and mule to meet with the rebels an informal deal was cut the mexican government wouldnt go after the epr if they stopped blowing things up the peace held for a few years but in the epr was allegedly involved in the killing of two undercover police officers who had tracked tiburcio to a mexico city safe house according to police epr activists persuaded locals the police were child molesters bent on kidnapping local children in a gruesome incident broadcast live over national television a crowd lynched the two agents and burned their bodies in mexican intelligence analysts say the epr saw an opportunity to grow by piggybacking on a bout of prolonged unrest in the city of oaxaca a radical teachers union went on its annual strike occupying the downtown area a failed attempt by state police to dislodge them led to chaos with raging street battles a loose coalition of more than organizations some considered epr fronts seized the city and controlled it for five months before federal police restored order in november "they the epr never thought they would get a chance to do a dress rehearsal for a popular insurrection " says a top mexican intelligence official now officials worry the epr may be using the two missing men to rally recruits and recover the momentum of last years oaxaca uprising they are racing to stop what many believe is an inevitable third wave of attacks police have recently questioned suspects about alleged epr plans to bomb embassies and kidnap top officials one high ranking official has met with former guerrillas who may or may not still belong to the epr aiming to persuade the group to give the government time to find the missing men "its a jigsaw puzzle with many pieces " says the intelligence official the latest issue of "el insurgente " the eprs monthly magazine that can be found at cedema org featured a photo of the spectacular flames caused by the september pipeline bombing the magazines pages include essays justifying the eprs attacks and defending its struggles against the government it closes with a poem signed with the nom de guerre "clandestina" im a persecuted guerrilla not because im a criminal but because im a revolutionary and i assume the consequences
