this holiday season electronics top wish lists it is a good sign for holiday sales at consumer electronics retailers that one recent survey found that big screen tv sets rank third highest on adults wish lists right after computers and peace and happiness the survey by the consumer electronics association hints at what some retail analysts are predicting entertainment gear and gadgets will take a larger share from consumers wallets this holiday season "in the past five years or so electronics have moved from kind of a nice to have to a must have " especially when it comes to things like cellphones and cameras said stephen baker vice president of analysis for the consumer technology industry at researcher npd group "electronics were considered much more discretionary a few years ago " still plenty of uncertainty remains about consumer sentiment especially as the price of crude oil approaches &# a barrel and about how price competition may affect retailers profits various preholiday surveys suggest consumers will show more self restraint when it comes to impulsive purchases for themselves and they may repeat the kind of procrastinating that delayed back to school sales still the consumer electronics association forecasts &# billion will be spent on consumer electronics gifts this year up from last year it also expects shoppers will be lured by good deals on tvs or other big ticket electronics and will make purchases for themselves pushing total spending on consumer electronics in the fourth quarter up to &# billion the national retail federation has said it expects u s retail sales this holiday season to increase many industry analysts expect consumer electronics to be a leading product category in holiday sales "we believe this christmas season could be dominated by three major categories within the consumer electronics space flat panel televisions videogames accessories and apple branded products " credit suisse analysts wrote in a recent note to clients they see a pattern unfolding similar to one in when the popularity and affordability of the personal computer likely pared demand for more traditional holiday items such as apparel and accessories this year it is the desirability variety and pricing of such items as flat screen tvs apple inc s latest ipod models and its iphone and videogaming systems that could create a consumer electronics skewed holiday season according to credit suisse "even the mall anchors are emphasizing electronics where they can " the company said noting that a recent macys ad offered a free inch lcd tv with the purchase of a mattress notebook computers navigational devices for cars and digital picture frames also are likely to be consumer favorites npds mr baker said the consumer electronics association said electronics have moved up on adults wish lists while clothes slipped from the top spot last year to fourth teenagers still put clothes atop their wish lists but the next four items were mp players videogames computers and cellphones analysts are split on whether retailers will engage in the kind of tv price wars that squeezed holiday profits in at best buy co and circuit city stores inc and helped to generate customer traffic at wal mart stores inc and costco wholesale corp tvs are the biggest product category for best buy and circuit city deflation trends have moderated at best buy and circuit city during the current quarter said deutsche bank securities analyst michael baker goldman sachs said one sign that best buy is optimistic about pricing is that the retailer is promoting its day price guarantee on high definition tvs bought through feb and it started the guarantee earlier than it did last year other analysts like npds mr baker are pessimistic "this year theres likely to be fighting for market share in a market thats not growing quite as fast so the claws may really come out " he said nearly three fourths of chief marketing officers at leading u s retailers expect discounting and promotions to be more plentiful than last year according to a study last month by accounting and consulting company bdo seidman llp supplies of tvs are more in balance with demand than they were last year and some retailers such as home depot inc that ventured into the category last year with disappointing results wont be selling tvs this year wal mart and costco continue to gain share aided by upstart lower price tv makers such as vizio inc and syntax brillian corp s olevia those brands are making inroads not only in discount channels but also in more traditional distribution outlets adding to competitive pressures across the spectrum of manufacturers cibc analyst vivian ma noted that wal marts first round of "secret in store specials" last week included deals on products made by sanyo and toshiba not the lowest end products that are usually used as loss leaders to attract shoppers using these so called tier brands as loss leaders will pressure pricing on the top tv brands such as samsung and panasonic which are mainstays of specialty retailers she said
