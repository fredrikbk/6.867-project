omnicoms super bowl ad buyer calls the plays tom mcgovern has never penned an ad slogan or written a clever jingle but come super bowl time one of the biggest nights of the year for the advertising business he will be in the spotlight as head of sports media for optimum sports a media buying firm owned by omnicom group mr mcgovern is overseeing the purchase of about super bowl ad slots about eight minutes of ad time for clients such as pepsico fedex universal studios and cars com that is about a quarter of the entire ad inventory for the game over the past few months mr mcgovern has spent countless hours on the phone and email haggling with news corp s fox over prices and particular time slots it isnt the first time he has been in this position he has been one of the biggest buyers of super bowl ads over the past eight years but mr mcgoverns job has been tougher this year because he has had to navigate a tighter market the network has only two spots left for super bowl xlii to be played feb which is giving fox the upper hand in negotiations demand for super bowl spots is being driven in part by renewed interest among movie studios this year as well as the lack of tv programs that get big ratings nowadays according to media buyers rates for a second spot have topped &# million for this seasons final game according to media buyers up from as high as &# million last year before it is all over some of the final slots for the championship game could sell for as much as &# million media buyers say still frequent advertisers or those buying more than one spot can often wheedle discounts first half spots for instance are more desirable than those in the back half of the game below are excerpts from a wall street journal interview with mr mcgovern whose comments include which kinds of ads are most effective to how to negotiate the best rates wsj when is the last time you saw this type of demand for super bowl ads mr mcgovern it goes back to when we had the dot com companies and many of them came on the scene and just bought super bowl ad time there was no media schedule no strategy behind it it was just all about getting their name out there wsj despite the waning power of tv ads the super bowl continues to be a must buy for many advertisers why mr mcgovern for mass brands and mega multibillion dollar brands reach is still critical there is nothing available in media that provides the reach that the super bowl has its becoming more so as you see the ratings of general entertainment television decline its not just the super bowl that has the strong demand big events such as the academy awards and bigger sporting events such as nfl games are doing well its also because consumers are watching live wsj is there a consensus about what the best slots are for advertisers and has the thinking on that changed over the years mr mcgovern well the consensus among advertisers is that earlier in the game is better viewers are more engaged in the beginning of the broadcast because the game hasnt really started yet so fans are paying closer attention to the ads but the largest audience is usually between the second and third quarter so the debate is over whether its better to be later and get more viewers or be earlier and get a more engaged audience there is also a great demand for the first commercial in every ad break because advertisers want to be closest to the game action wsj it seems networks have the upper hand when it comes to super bowl negotiations how do you as a buyer even the playing field mr mcgovern it goes back to amount of inventory we buy our volume typically drives better deals if you look over the history of the game there is a core base of advertisers who help create the demand if the core advertisers dont return then the network is in a more challenging positioning we have seen that happen over the past few years with the movie studios wsj whats the best use of super bowl ad time humor celebrities nostalgic themes mr mcgovern i think people always want to see humor especially on a day when they are gathered with family and friends in groups people like to cry too even though they dont like to admit it wsj what teams are you hoping make it to the super bowl mr mcgovern i want to see the best game with the biggest appeal so i either want to see the new england patriots or indianapolis colts versus the dallas cowboys or the new york giants that game would have the biggest mass appeal unfortunately the jets will not be in the super bowl they are my team
