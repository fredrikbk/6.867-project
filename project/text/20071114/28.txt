common sense hold bhp and let others chase commodities craze smartmoney sometimes a cloud has a silver lining or should i say a gold iron or aluminum lining amid last weeks market slump it was no small consolation to be the owner of shares in rio tinto the big mining concern that ive recommended repeatedly and most recently bought during the summer rio tinto shares jumped more than on news of a possible takeover bid from rival bhp billiton which came through with a &# billion offer on monday shares surged to &# before dropping back and closing yesterday at &# suddenly i find myself on both sides of a takeover battle since i own bhp shares too i also own cia vale rio doce the big brazilian mining concern that could emerge as a rival bidder this is an unusual position for me ive written often about takeovers and arbitrage strategies most recently in connection with the whole foods acquisition of wild oats for some reason ive usually owned shares in the company doing the bidding rather than vice versa as readers of my m&amp a playbook well know shares of acquiring companies usually drop while the targets shares soar it can be both difficult and potentially rewarding to figure out if the acquiring companys shares represent a bargain i always thought it would be so easy if you own shares of the target you just sit back and cash in the gains now that im actually in this position of course it doesnt seem so simple im in no rush to sell rio tinto bhps current offer is three bhp shares for each rtp share according to bhp this amounts to a premium over rio tintos share price on nov a value of approximately &# for each adr traded in the u s this is far below the &# rtp reached last week which may account for this weeks decline but even if bhp doesnt increase its offer and no other bidder emerges the bhp bid has pretty much set a floor under rtps share price the "just say no" defense no longer works which means that if rio tinto persists in ignoring or rebuffing bhp it will have to find another scenario to deliver returns to shareholders a lower share price will only keep the company in play rio tinto might consider a counterbid for bhp or try to rustle up a takeover or merger of its own that would make it so big as to be prohibitively expensive but surely ceos and their investment banking advisers have learned by now that tactics that ignore shareholders and serve only to entrench corporate managers are bad for business the bid for rio tinto has come at a time when commodities mania is at an all time high now that the art craze and real estate bubble are over and the credit crisis is in full bloom where is all the worlds liquidity flowing into inflation hedges like gold and other commodities demand from emerging economies for basic materials continues to soar this seems the ideal time for rio tinto to auction off its incredibly rich holdings in an array of precious and other metals and ores either to one bidder like bhp or by breaking itself into pieces id be cautious about being a commodities buyer right now the rtp bid set off a wave of excitement in the basic materials sector with investors rushing into stocks considered vulnerable to similar takeovers but the same group of candidates could also be rival bidders in which case their shares like bhps would likely decline id let the gold dust settle so to speak before making any precipitous investments the one exception might be bhp whose shares have dropped is it now a bargain in a sizzling sector the danger is that it will overpay but the potential benefits seem compelling high risk investors seeking commodities exposure might want to buy bhp on further weakness for the rest of us there will be plenty of time to assess the situation for now my advice is to let others chase the commodities craze i plan to hold my bhp and rtp shares and enjoy the show while it lasts james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com commonsense
