the no farmer left behind act perhaps its beneath the dignity of members of congress to shop at a grocery store but if they did theyd know that food prices are rising faster than at anytime in years milk now costs &# a gallon in many states eggs oranges peas tomatoes and rice are selling at or near all time highs the biggest winners have been corn producers as corn prices have doubled in two years thanks in part to new mandates for ethanol all of this is translating into the best gains in farm wealth in decades total farm income is expected to leap by to &# billion this year according to the usda the average income of full time farmers hit &# last year with large corporate farms earning in the millions of dollars meanwhile farmland prices in the past five years have increased by &# billion a year or an average asset gain of &# per year per full time farmer and yet congress is writing another five year farm bill as if this were and the okies roamed the plains the house has already passed a &# billion bill and the &# billion version now moving through the senate may be the largest feast of subsidies ever served up by congress the bills estimated &# billion in direct crop payments and another &# billion in "emergency assistance" and insurance subsidies are stacked as high as an iowa silo in other industries we celebrate the impact of trade and technology in reducing prices but u s farm programs are expressly designed to make food prices higher for consumers economists estimate that americans pay about &# billion more a year for food as a consequence on top of the higher taxes to sustain the direct handouts about &# of every &# in the senate bill go straight into the pockets of the growers of five commercial crops corn cotton rice soybeans and wheat the idea of subsidizing corn growers at todays prices makes about as much sense as government sending a check to every american who owns google stock but thats not all the powerful sugar honey and dairy lobbies have also won expansions of their price supports these government price guarantees come even though the world trade organization ruled last month that u s cotton subsidies violate american trade agreements farm state senators have also broadened the constituency for farm welfare by allocating about &# billion for fruit vegetable and nut growers who have rarely been on the dole in the past so the farm bill includes millions of dollars for california asparagus growers montana and idaho chickpea and camelina an oilseed used for biofuel producers and north dakota and washington producers of dried peas lentils and ckickpeas georgia peanut farmers will be eligible for an additional &# each in aid next year even the preposterous wool and mohair subsidy for goat herders which was eliminated last decade in the freedom to farm act is resurrected under the guise of the national sheep and goat industry improvement center and though this is a democratic congress that claims to care about "inequality " the usda says about two thirds of this farm aid goes to the wealthiest of farms it is a direct transfer from taxpayers and poor consumers to mostly rich corporate farmers president bush has requested that subsidies only go to farmers with incomes below &# but the senate bill has no income caps for full time farmers one proposed amendment by minnesota democrat amy klobuchar would establish a cap of &# in income but thats still about times the average family income in america and the farm lobby is fighting even that the house subsidy ceiling is &# million a year which after fancy accounting would exclude no corporate farms at all yet all of this is defended as a "safety net " the truth is that modern farm bills are really about buying votes in some of the most highly contested congressional battlegrounds north dakota democrat kent conrad recently gave this game away when he mocked mr bushs veto threat "if the president wants to turn states like mine into solid democratic states " a farm veto "would be a good way to do it " mr conrad chairs the senate budget committee and fancies himself a "deficit hawk " his farm bill nonetheless makes a mockery of his "pay as you go" budget rules by using bookkeeping gimmicks to create fictitious savings some &# billion is "saved" by moving farm payments just outside the official five year budget window in a rare moment of self reflection iowa liberal and senate agriculture chairman tom harkin recently admitted that farm subsidies are "very hard to justify when were having record prices and incomes " no kidding see related letters "letters to the editor a frank exchange of views on the farm bill" wsj nov
