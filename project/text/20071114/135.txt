why wal mart set up shop in italy retailer has no stores as tax spat lays bare more than miles separate a small wal mart stores inc office in florence italy from the companys dozens of illinois retail outlets but thanks to a convoluted tax arrangement court records show wal marts italian operation has helped the giant retailer cut its state tax bill in illinois by millions of dollars a year wal mart set its affairs so that its italian outpost is the only operating unit of a real estate subsidiary that controls billions of dollars of the retailers property in illinois and other states because technically its only employees are based in italy the real estate unit claims its operations are foreign exempt from illinois corporate income taxes earlier this year the illinois department of revenue objected to the italian tax maneuver demanding &# million in back taxes interest and penalties wal mart paid the amount in dispute and then sued the state for a refund according to a complaint filed in may in illinois circuit court in springfield ill a wal mart spokesman declined to comment beyond a prepared statement "we have a disagreement with the state of illinois over our tax liability last year and weve asked a judge to resolve that for us " he declined to explain why italy was chosen as the home of this particular foreign operation or whether wal mart has other such arrangements the dispute with wal mart is part of a wider effort by some states to crack down on what they believe is abusive use of so called companies these companies are domestic subsidiaries that conduct at least of their business overseas states typically dont tax income from outside the u s and many companies have used subsidiaries to legitimately shield foreign operations from state taxation but authorities in several states have challenged a number of companies over the units claiming the structure was improperly used to shift income away from the purview of state taxing authorities the misuse of companies is "shocking to the conscience " said brian hamer director of the illinois department of revenue "these kinds of manipulations clearly were never contemplated by the state legislatures " added mr hamer who wouldnt comment on any single company or legal case "it ought to have been clear to businesses that this was highly questionable conduct " illinois tax authorities are in a dispute with mcdonalds corp over nearly &# million stemming from its use of an subsidiary details are sketchy but mcdonalds based in oak brook ill says in court papers that a delaware financing unit that owns restaurants in st thomas virgin islands conducts or more of its business activity outside the u s exempting its operations from being included in illinois tax calculations meanwhile minnesota tax authorities are taking issue with interest payments made by burlington northern santa fe corp to a pair of delaware subsidiaries doing business in canada the railway company deducted the interest associated with the payments but didnt pay taxes on most of the income received by the subsidiaries the states revenue department says in an audit report that this was "done purely for tax avoidance purposes " the fort worth texas company paid a disputed &# million in back taxes and interest and sued the state in may for a refund a mcdonalds spokeswoman said "we believe the results of our business have been properly reported to the state of illinois " a burlington northern spokesman declined to comment at the prodding of the illinois revenue department that states legislature in passed a law essentially shutting down the abusive use of units the minnesota state legislature enacted one change in and has considered several other bills since then to shut down alleged abuse of the structure wal marts italian tax planning maneuver is the latest disclosure of a strategy by the firm to cut state taxes a page one article in the wall street journal in february focused on how the bentonville ark retailer cut taxes in some states by paying rent to a real estate investment trust it owned even though the money never left the firm that reit strategy has been challenged by tax authorities in several sates some have enacted laws to close the reit structure since the journal article however the reit tax structure saved money only in some states those that tax income solely from operations within their borders this taxation system known as "separate reporting " can make it simpler for companies to shift income out of state to tax friendly jurisdictions such as delaware or nevada but "combined reporting" states such as illinois are much tougher they add together all profits of a companys domestic operations regardless of what state they are in and then allocate a portion of those profits to their state theoretically combined reporting makes it harder for companies to shift income to more advantageous locales because illinois rules apply only to domestic profits not world wide income companies can get around the rules by figuring out ways to effectively shift income overseas wal marts structure worked like this the company first transferred its illinois stores to its in house reits paid rent to the reits and then deducted those payments from its taxes the reits in turn paid that money to their owner a wal mart unit based in delaware ordinarily illinoiss combined reporting rules wouldnt permit a company to cut its taxes by shifting income to a delaware unit but in late wal mart formed a delaware subsidiary called wmgs services llc records show wmgs with offices in florence was a wholly owned subsidiary of wal mart property co which also was owner of wal marts main reit in its filing wal mart contends that property co s ownership of the italian unit converted property co into an company in other words at least of its employees and its property were overseas exempting its income from taxes though property co is the owner of the reit which owns dozens of stores in illinois wal mart says property co owns no real estate itself and although wal mart has more than employees in illinois the firm contends property co has no employees in the state either the only employees of property co were in italy the company says property co was set up to own the majority of the shares of wal marts main reit and has no employees anywhere wal mart has said in court records elsewhere in its court filing in illinois wal mart says that wmgss employees and property were in turin italy an official with the company in florence and a wal mart spokesman in the u s say the company doesnt have an office in turin wmgs employs people at its office in central florence according to a company official who answered the door there on a recent weekday morning the office is responsible for procuring merchandise from around europe he said wal mart has no stores in italy rosamaria mancini contributed to this article
