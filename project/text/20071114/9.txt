as the japanese yen goes so too do stocks usually to understand whether global investors are feeling fearful or optimistic keep an eye on the japanese yen thats because the yen has become an unexpectedly important barometer of investors appetite for risk world wide if investors get worried the yen often strengthens conversely when investors are willing to go out on a limb the yen tends to weaken thats what happened yesterday when u s stocks surged amid falling oil prices and hopes that the impact from the subprime mortgage crisis on banks will be contained at the same time the yen weakened against the dollar with one dollar buying yen late in new york up from yen on monday the movements arent coincidental they stem from the unusual influence of japans super low interest rates on global markets from new york to new zealand they also explain why the yen itself a perennially weak currency has strengthened against the dollar since the end of june its not just because investors are discouraged about the u s economic outlook it has a lot to do with the fact that theyre reassessing the degree of peril in the market the yen is now "sort of like the canary in the mine " says jerome abernathy chief investment officer of stonebrook capital management a new york currency manager "its quite sensitive to risk aversion " the currencys unique role is tied directly to japans remarkably low rates risk taking investors are enticed to borrow cheaply in yen then invest the borrowed money in other countries where returns can be higher this maneuver weakens the yen because the borrowers are essentially selling yen to buy other currencies but when investors get risk averse they tend to undo these bets known as "carry trades" and pay off their borrowing because undoing the trade involves buying back yen it strengthens the japanese currency the result is that the yen has become a proxy for a tough to measure concept investors willingness to take chances with their money "it all boils down to risk " says jonas thulin a currency strategist at calyon the investment banking arm of credit agricole late last week and through monday investors reduced their exposure to risk over a broad range of assets driving down investments from stocks to junk bonds to oil and buying safe haven assets such as u s treasurys in the currency markets the same dynamic played out and investors reacted by buying yen mr abernathy of stonebrook says his firm exited from its carry trade positions on the last day of october as signs of risk aversion started to pick up before re entering those trades he says hell be looking for fear and volatility to ease from current levels one way to understand the yens role is to look at its movements in correlation with stocks even those on the other side of the world for instance a popular carry trade is to borrow in japan where the key interest rate is and invest in australia where it is it turns out this kind of trade closely tracks the standard &amp poors stock index which is itself a key measure of risk appetite since the start of the correlation between the s&amp p and the number of yen that can be purchased with one australian dollar has been close to perfect when stocks fall the yen tends to strengthen against the australian dollar when stocks rise it nearly always weakens since the start of october in particular there has also been a similarly tight relationship between the s&amp p and the number of yen that can be purchased with one u s dollar the problem for investors is that these links arent necessarily predictive "of course theyre related but focusing on the correlation between two markets doesnt tell you what to do tomorrow " says mr thulin of calyon his approach has been to try to forecast volatility before it actually bursts onto stock markets last week that translated into a recommendation to buy yen something that turned out to be a profitable trade back in mid august the height of the market turmoil coincided with a sharp unwinding of yen carry trades the yen strengthened more than against the dollar in days and even more against currencies such as the australian and new zealand dollars the size of the carry trade is difficult to measure since it encompasses the activities of myriad individuals corporations and speculators ranging from mom and pop japanese investors who trade currencies from home to hedge funds to businesses around the world that borrow in yen as part of their overall financial strategies still there are indications that since the market turbulence of july and august investors have been less keen on such trades than they were before the summers turmoil particularly speculators looking for a quick profit much will depend on whether markets calm down or continue to seesaw one gauge of investor nervousness which measures expected volatility has spiked the chicago board options exchanges market volatility index better known
