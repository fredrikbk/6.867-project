ags porsche rounding out the top are subaru lexus infiniti audi and toyota none of the top ranked brands in kbbs latest survey of predicted resale value is made or owned by a detroit auto maker detroit made or owned brands made up eight of kbbs worst resale picks for models boosting resale value is an urgent task for detroits auto makers with data about used vehicle values and predicted resale values also known as residual values widely available on the internet consumers can fairly easily factor likely resale value into a buying or leasing decision detroits auto makers have suffered in such comparisons because they have tended to push for share by overproducing then slapping on big discounts or selling vehicles in bulk to rental car companies those tactics undermined resale values for models on the road and the predicted resale values used by finance companies to set lease payments on new cars detroits big three have recently slashed production of even hot selling items in an effort to boost residual values kbb the nations best known vehicle valuation service says it develops its resale value projections by analyzing new and used vehicle data and projecting the likely value of new models after five years of ownership it says it excludes low volume models and most vehicles with sticker prices above &# for example a customer who paid the &# list price for a honda civic lx sedan could wind up spending less to own the vehicle for five years than she would if she paid &# for a ford focus se sedan the average honda civic lx according to kbbs calculations should retain of its value after five years while the average ford focus se would be worth of its original price based on those figures the cost of the honda civic less the projected resale value would be &# while the ford focus less its projected resale value would cost &# the example doesnt factor in interest charges that disparity would tend to make the monthly cost of leasing the focus

but has hinted it intends to add capacity here and ramp up sales of the four brands ranked immediately volkswagen none was separated by more than a percentage point a year ago acura and honda tied for the top spot this years results in part reflected differences in the way kelley calculated residuals despite failing to maintain the top spot in the survey acura and honda models improved their resale values from a year ago kbb said "well be back " says mike spencer an acura spokesman bmws mini brand and toyota motor corp s scion hold better than residuals but werent counted by kbb because they didnt have at least four nameplates in their portfolios ford and chrysler llc dominated the worst depreciation list with four and three brands each respectively fords luxury jaguar brand which the auto maker hopes to sell early next year retains just of its original price while ford holds lincoln and mercury "obviously if youre building more products than there is retail demand for youll be tempted to sell them to rental fleets thats something weve certainly done in excess in the past " says jim cain a ford spokesman he says that some of fords newer vehicles such as the edge crossover
