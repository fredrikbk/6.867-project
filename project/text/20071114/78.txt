mccaw bets again on wireless frontier cellphone billionaire seeks wimax network sprint deal collapses craig mccaw got rich betting on cellphones when they were still brick size gadgets with just minutes of battery life these days hes rolling the dice on another untested concept a nationwide high speed wireless network based on wimax technology his company clearwire corp is trying to cobble together a network to give customers fast affordable internet access for laptops and mobile devices in their homes cars commuter trains almost anywhere "nobody has fulfilled the dream of what mobile broadband could be " says mr mccaw years old who has been working at it for more than a decade its proving a formidable challenge wimax a longer range cousin of the wi fi technology that creates internet hot spots in homes and coffee shops is unproven for large scale use clearwire needs to buy up radio spectrum and erect towers all over the country which will likely cost billions of dollars right now what mr mccaw needs most is a deep pocketed corporate partner last week his plans on that front were dealt a blow sprint nextel corp which is working on its own wimax network scrapped a preliminary agreement to join forces with clearwire to build a national one a separate plan to spin off sprints broadband unit and merge it with clearwire was rejected by sprints board last week people familiar with the situation say the two companies are continuing to talk these people say mr mccaw might have other options computer chip maker intel corp cable operator comcast corp google inc and at least one satellite tv company had all been considering investing in a sprint clearwire joint venture people close to the matter say clearwire has been holding discussions with some of those parties about a direct partnership these people say mr mccaw professes confidence that he will overcome the difficulties "theres always been this sort of messiness thats created opportunities " he says wireless broadband connections are widely available right now but the technologies currently in use have limitations services offered by cellphone carriers are more expensive than landline connections such as cable and dsl and they cant handle some data heavy applications such as online video streaming wi fi which is available in many airports and coffee shops only provides connections over short distances attempts to roll it out across major cities such as san francisco and chicago have sputtered wimax was approved in as a new international standard for transmitting data wirelessly its backers say it is more efficient for internet access than cellular networks which were designed primarily for voice communications as with cellular networks carriers expect to use wimax with licensed frequencies other wireless carriers in the u s and abroad are testing wimax but because the technology is unproven and because it would require carriers to build expensive new transmission networks many carriers have thus far opted to try to enhance their existing cellular networks to offer better internet connections building a wireless company from scratch is daunting but mr mccaw has done it before he took over his familys cable tv company while still in college after his father died of a stroke in the s gambling on the future of mobile communications he bought up radio spectrum around the country and pieced together the nations largest cellular network in he sold mccaw cellular to at&amp t for &# billion mr mccaw maintains a low profile rarely speaking publicly he spends half his time in vienna where his wife is finishing a term as u s ambassador an avid pilot he often flies himself to europe and to business meetings in a private jet he formed clearwire in late and took the company public in march still he remains leery of tipping off potential competitors about its business plans "sometimes people get more interested in something when they know im interested in it " he said during a recent interview at his kirkland wash office which overlooks lake washington he jokingly refers to himself as an "idiot savant " and is quick to credit people who have worked with him on various ventures over the years including nicolas kauser a clearwire director and robert mechaley the firms vice chairman messrs kauser and mechaley were part of mr mccaws experiment with wireless internet services at mccaw cellular dubbed "project angel " at the time there wasnt adequate technology for the job and at&amp t scrapped the project after acquiring the company mr mccaw didnt abandon the idea he founded a company to provide internet access via satellite which got financial backing in the late s from boeing co and saudi prince alwaleed bin talal among others but it suspended operations in before launching a single satellite when it became clear that there wouldnt be sufficient consumer demand to justify the projected &# billion cost by with land based wireless technologies improving mr mccaw decided to make another push the key would be to get enough radio spectrum the wireless industry had shelled out billions of dollars at periodic auctions held by the federal communications commission for the right to use specified parts of the spectrum mr mccaw wanted to avoid that costly strategy he decided to focus mainly on an obscure region of the spectrum little used frequencies high up on the radio dial used since the s by universities churches and other nonprofits for educational broadcasting the los angeles archdiocese for example used its spectrum to broadcast tv to its more than catholic schools most of these groups used only a tiny portion of their frequencies leaving open the possibility that the rest could be used for something else until mr mccaw came along few in the wireless industry saw much value in that spectrum for one thing it could only be leased not purchased and the only way to put together a big block of frequencies was to negotiate individually with hundreds of organizations across the country each of them controlling frequencies with ranges as short as miles moreover the prospects of using such spectrum for wireless internet service were unclear because the wireless connections could be disrupted by the signals broadcast by the nonprofit groups mr mccaw smelled a potential bargain "we said somebodys got to put this all together " he recalls he founded his new company after acquiring clearwire technologies inc a small texas based wireless broadband startup that was folding after a few years in operation the deal gave clearwire its name and a handful of spectrum licenses mr mccaw took over as chairman and chief executive officer and assembled a team to do spectrum deals with educational institutions and churches many nonprofit groups were eager because earlier efforts to lease spectrum to niche tv operators often had failed the nonprofits were beginning to worry that the federal government would take back their spectrum because of insufficient use they needed a viable commercial partner mr mccaw persuaded them that clearwire wouldnt waste time getting its networks up and running "what we liked was the entrepreneurial spirit and how they seemed to get things done quickly " says steven gorski chief executive officer of network for instructional tv inc a nonprofit that broadcasts programming to public schools and community colleges in cities mr mccaw offered cash payments for leases plus additional incentives his deal with the los angeles archdiocese for example calls for clearwire eventually to provide free wireless internet service and videoconferencing equipment to archdiocese schools libraries and parishes in june mr mccaw helped push through a change at the fcc that dramatically increased the value of the frequencies he was gobbling up after lobbying by clearwire and others the fcc reorganized that portion of the radio spectrum to reduce interference between transmitters like broadcasters and wireless operators like clearwire "this was clearly a strategy to get spectrum for below market value and it was very effective " mr mccaw says beginning in late clearwire launched service in small markets such as jacksonville fla and st cloud minn for &# a month consumers could get a bulky wireless broadband modem to connect their computers to the internet it wasnt yet truly mobile users still had to find a place to plug in their modems but they didnt have to be in wi fi hot spots wimax equipment wasnt available then clearwire remained a bit player mr mccaw needed a bigger partner to build out nationwide service quickly and sprint emerged as the logical choice the telecom operator picked up a huge amount of spectrum similar to clearwires through its acquisition of nextel communications in sprint chief executive gary forsee was already contemplating a wireless broadband buildout of his own sprint and clearwire were competing all over the country to acquire spectrum from universities and churches both knew a partnership made sense mr mccaw knew nextel well he had invested in the company early in its life and had served on its board he also was friendly with mr forsee over the next year the two men talked occasionally about ways to team up in july clearwire announced it had adopted the emerging wimax standard for its network part of a round of funding by motorola inc and intel two backers of the technology that same day mr mccaw spoke by phone with sprints mr forsee he recalls telling mr forsee it would be much easier for the companies to cooperate in the future if sprint adopted the same technology one month later sprint announced it too had selected wimax mr forsee did not respond to requests for comment at that time mr mccaw was lobbying the fcc about at&amp t inc s &# billion acquisition of bellsouth corp which had been unveiled that spring most telecom startups regarded the merger as the reincarnation of the ma bell phone monopoly and a major threat but mr mccaw saw opportunity he had been trying for two years to purchase a chunk of spectrum from bellsouth that covered large southeastern markets such as orlando atlanta and miami if clearwire controlled those markets sprint would have a big incentive to partner with it mr mccaw pressed the fcc to require at&amp t to divest itself of the spectrum as a condition of the merger he had periodically visited the fcc chairman and other regulators to argue that such frequencies should be in the hands of nimble new companies not slow moving behemoths after a big push by clearwires washington d c lobbying team the fcc approved the merger in late december with spectrum divestiture a condition in february mr mccaw swooped in and bought that slice of the airwaves for &# million other companies that were interested in buying the frequencies including sprint were surprised mr mccaw pulled off the deal so quickly "one day everyone woke up and they had sold it to clearwire " says one competitor an at&amp t spokesman said the carrier considered two bids and clearwires was superior as clearwire accumulated more spectrum mr mccaw and benjamin wolff who took over as ceo early this year began thinking about trying to sell customers more than just high speed internet access the company had begun offering internet phone service in june it struck partnerships with directv group inc and echostar communications corp the deals will allow clearwire to offer satellite tv in late may messrs mccaw and wolff flew to washington d c to meet with sprints mr forsee the three talked through a partnership over dinner at the four seasons hotel in georgetown by then clearwires spectrum covered more than million people in the u s the trio agreed the time was right for a pact in july they tentatively agreed to build out a wimax network reaching million people by the end of sprint said it would build of the initial footprint at a cost of &# billion clearwire would handle the rest the network would use a joint brand name the deal promised to turn mr mccaws startup into a nationwide player but in early october as the two companies were working to finalize the deal mr forsee resigned abruptly after news broke that sprints board had begun searching for a new ceo last week the two companies announced they had canceled the partnership clearwires stock sank in a day clearwire and sprint representatives were already working on a different arrangement sprint would spin off its wimax unit and combine it with clearwire in a meeting last week sprints board decided against it but agreed to continue talking to clearwire people familiar with the matter say sprint is likely to wait until it hires a new ceo before making any more significant wimax decisions these people say in the meantime mr mccaw is talking to potential investors eager to make deals before an upcoming spectrum auction by the fcc although clearwire needs a cash infusion mr mccaw says he isnt in a hurry to sell the company "you cant build to sell " he says "if you build to sell youre not building anything of sustained value "
