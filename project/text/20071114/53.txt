gao probe finds tax fraud in medicaid washington a congressional investigation found widespread tax fraud by doctors hospitals and other health care providers participating in the medicaid program but the way that the program is administered among other reasons may prevent improving compliance anytime soon the government accountability office congresss audit arm reported that of providers in seven states for medicaid the joint federal state health insurance for the poor owed more than &# billion in back taxes as of sept many had withheld money from their employees for social security medicare and personal income taxes but never forwarded it to the internal revenue service the gao report says the figure represents more than providers the probe requested by the senates permanent subcommittee on investigations follows other federal investigations into tax abuses by federal contractors in march the agency reported that physicians and other people doing business with medicare the federal health program for the elderly and disabled failed to pay more than &# billion in withheld taxes through september the subcommittee is scheduled today to hold a hearing on the new gao findings a spokeswoman from the american hospital association said she hasnt seen the report and couldnt comment sen norm coleman r minn and others in congress want more federal agencies to adopt a levy system that would allow the irs to withhold government payments to contractors who owe taxes after the march report medicare officials vowed to cooperate with the irs and beef up its accounting practices but it is a bigger challenge for the government to stop the alleged abuses by medicaid providers unlike medicare the strictly federal program medicaid is a joint program that has more layers of bureaucracy washington sends funding to states which administer the program and make payments to providers there are a total of medicaid programs in the u s and its territories for that reason federal tax officials say it is difficult to include medicaid payments in a federal levy system the irs in response to the gao investigation said that it doesnt consider medicaid payments to be federal payments toward the levy system and states have their own rights the centers for medicare and medicaid services medicaids overseer isnt required to screen providers for tax debts nor does current law prohibit those with owing taxes from billing medicaid for their services "the fact is we believe that the stated goals of this investigation were based on misconceptions about the authority and responsibilities of the medicaid program moreover the report leaves the unfortunate impression that cms and the states should be conducting certain activities even if precluded under current federal law " said cms spokesman jeff nelligan the gao said it is "concerned that cms stated it would be inappropriate" to keep tax cheaters out of medicaid
