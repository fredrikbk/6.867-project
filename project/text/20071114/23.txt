business veteran weighs in on tackling bad loans in a world full of bosses with short memories too many bankers stand out as amnesiacs first came a series of ill fated loans to the developing world in the s followed by massive defaults on real estate lending in the early s and worrisome exposure to the collapse of hedge fund long term capital management in now banks must contend with the subprime lending mess in each case they have vowed to be more careful next time so far they havent been how could so many well paid well educated people get trapped in multiple boom and bust cycles and how should they extricate themselves this time some intriguing insights come from john s reed one of the most cerebral bank chief executives of modern times who seemed to spend the bulk of his career creating or digging out from one lending mess after another the year old mr reed ran americas largest bank citigroup or its predecessor citicorp from to before losing a power struggle with his co chief executive at the time sandy weill mr reed is retired from banking today most scorecards on mr reeds tenure are sharply mixed overall citis stock beat market averages handily during his tenure but his aloof style and periodic stumbles tarnished his record still mr reeds familiarity with bad debt workouts is in a class by itself in a hour interview last week he shared the lessons of those campaigns what mr reed knows he learned the hard way citi struggled in his first few years at the helm because of its huge exposure to soured latin american loans then the bank nearly came unstuck in because of problem real estate loans it took the watchful eye of u s regulators and an equity infusion from saudi prince alwaleed bin talal to help citi get back on course during his banking career mr reed usually portrayed citi as a strategic leader trying hard to execute its plans in a turbulent world now he is more candid everyone in banking points to risk management as a top priority he says but that is often just lip service risk analysis can easily become a series of routine chores that offer little protection from the unexpected what is more with banks often under pressure to meet earnings targets there is a tendency to allow any department thats booking big profits to keep sprinting ahead mr reed says it took encouragement from citis outside directors in the early s to install early warning systems or tripwires that could get the banks lending departments to rethink business assumptions before it was too late as obvious as such precautions seem they are the banking equivalent of checking the mirrors and buckling up before a highway drive it is surprising how many people dont always bother and if lenders arent gazing widely enough nasty surprises will be inevitable mr reed has some sharp words too for the ways that banks pay risk managers "if they get stock options or get rewarded for earnings per share theyll approve everything " he cautions cash bonuses make it easier to reward risk managers most vital task blocking ill advised deals even when star executives want to charge ahead other incentive systems dont fully recognize such bravery mr reeds most provocative warning be careful who you listen to when real estate loans went bad in his early briefings came from top specialists in those areas these lenders were articulate and chock full of details he recalls "but they were so imbedded in the situation that they didnt see the full extent of the problems " mr reed recalls "they believed the market was overreacting you had to distance yourself sufficiently so you had better context if i had kept listening to my real estate guys i would have been fired " as citi worked through its problem loans the bankers who originated those credits often were excluded from key talks "they fought it " mr reed says "they felt it wasnt fair " but he says his approach made it easier for citi to reset its lending compass often by heeding federal regulators or investment bank advisers at morgan stanley mr reed repeatedly waved off detailed questions about the current lending debacle but a few of his maxims from past downturns remain relevant today "your first guess is about half of what you end up writing off " he says he started the downturn thinking citi needed an extra &# billion of real estate related reserves it ultimately needed about &# billion it just isnt possible to see the full extent of problems right away mr reed says as a result bankers need to be careful about making premature public estimates of bad loan exposure if they dont want to be in the awkward position of repeatedly increasing that number when times get really tough mr reed acknowledges banks face plenty of calls to sell off assets a strategy that amounts to shrinking to survive he refused to go that route in the early s preferring to cut the dividend and take in new equity albeit on painfully dilutive terms citis stock ultimately rebounded smartly led by strong earnings from businesses such as credit cards which otherwise might have been sold citi these days is looking for a new permanent chief executive after this months departure of chuck prince mr reed has appeared on a few lists as a long shot contender but a full comeback appears unlikely mr reed says he is comfortable in retirement "ill do anything to help citi including shutting up " he quips
