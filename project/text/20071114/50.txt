fiscally fit making the most of benefits terri offers tips for how to navigate this years open enrollment season online edition its that time of year again open enrollment season some people consider having to make decisions about their employee benefits a minor annoyance but i look at it as an opportunity to review how well im managing my out of pocket costs for health care dependent care and commuting the biggest decision for most workers is choosing a health insurance plan ironically this year the biggest mistake workers may make with health plan choices is to not make a choice says sara taylor annual enrollment leader at human resources company hewitt associates in the past if workers made no changes to their current health care plan theyd remain in the same plan the following year but this year more companies are asking workers to re enroll if they want to remain in their current plans "if they dont enroll they may be assigned no coverage at all and employees will be stuck with that decision for a year " unless they have a change in status such as a marriage or new child ms taylor warns "people need to understand what can happen if they do nothing " why the switch health plan options are changing with many employers shifting to high deductible health insurance plans that include health savings accounts with workers having to pay more of their own health care costs employers and plan providers are pushing them to better understand their plan options i opt out of participating in my employers health care plans because the preferred provider organization offered by my husbands labor union provides flexibility in the types of doctors we can see and services we may need we also arent required to contribute to the insurance premiums as my companys employees do it seems likely though that gerry will be required to do so in the coming years picking the right insurance plan depends on your health and your stage in life if you have children or a chronic medical condition lean toward flexible plans with low deductibles if youre young childless and generally healthy you may be better off picking a plan that offers a lower premium in exchange for a high deductible and then paying for out of pocket costs with a health savings account tom billet a senior consultant at watson wyatt worldwide a global consulting firm says wealthy workers might also be better off with a high deductible plan and a health savings account because they can afford to fully fund the account and let unspent savings roll over year to year to pay future health care expenses which may be more costly for singles could save a maximum of &# and a family could sock away as much as &# i dont participate in my employers health care plan but i do put money into a health care flexible spending account many workers particularly young singles make the mistake of paying more taxes than they should because they dont take advantage of these pre tax savings accounts says mr billet who notes that "you could be saving of every dollar you spend " the reason most workers dont contribute to such accounts is the "use it or lose it" provision any money unspent in the account at the end of the year is forfeited but mr billet says workers are less likely to leave money on the table because theyre being asked to foot a greater portion of health care expenses "the average health care plan today has a deductible of &# which is quite a bit more than it was four or five years ago " he says indeed a hewitt survey estimates employees will contribute an average of &# toward insurance premiums in compared with &# this year out of pocket expenses are also expected to climb thanks to higher co pays and deductibles according to hewitt employees can expect to pay an average &# out of pocket in or about more than last year as i detailed in an earlier column i underestimated our health care spending outlay this year dental bills and the newly discovered hearing and eyesight problems of our year old son gerald led to big health care bills this year by july wed already spent the &# annual pre tax savings in our health care flexible spending account since then our deductible and co pays have been paid with after tax dollars still that &# pre tax contribution saved us nearly &# in taxes assuming a federal tax rate a state tax rate and in social security and medicare tax to figure out how much i need to save for next year i grabbed the stack of "explanation of benefits" statements ive saved since july you save yours too right and added up our after tax out of pocket costs &# i figure ive probably spent another &# or so on over the counter products that qualify for reimbursement geralds doctor told us hell probably need new glasses this year and were still in the process of addressing his hearing loss we anticipate our health care expenses will probably be equally high next year so ive boosted my health care account savings target to &# if we spend the full amount in well save &# in taxes this calculator shows how much you can save worried about the potential for losing savings you dont spend mr billet suggests aiming low "see if you can estimate how much you spent in the last year using your explanation of benefits statements and save half of that " he says "its a fairly conservative bet and youre increasing the likelihood you wont leave any money on the table " that brings me to my dependent care savings account i used to save the &# pre tax maximum in the dependent care savings account when my son was in day care and with child care costs in the metro new york area i wished i could have saved more now that geralds older the bills are getting smaller between his summer day camp and his after school program i need to save about &# a year that pre tax account saves us from paying an extra &# in taxes my employer also offers a pre tax commuter expense account this year i checked my account online for the first time and discovered i had a &# balance id been working on a book from home and wasnt paying as much for commuting costs my unused account balance carries over from year to year as long as i remain with my employer at which point any unused balance would be forfeited to my employer i decided to stop contributing the &# a month ive been saving while i spend down that &# with ferry commuting costs i estimate that will take about three months more employers are turning to online tools to help workers better navigate the enrollment process with a couple of clicks i was able to see all the health insurance plans my employer offers and compare the pros and cons of each if youre not sure where to go online ask your employee benefits manager another couple of clicks and all of my savings goals for the flexible spending account were set and so another open enrollment season comes to a close it wasnt the most entertaining hour ive ever spent but well be grateful for the tax savings next year
