franchisees balk at dollar menu mcdonalds corp regards its dollar menu as a key part of its "plan to win" strategy but there is rising discontent among franchisees that it also is a way to lose money as the cost of food ingredients rises the profit margin on the menus most popular item the double cheeseburger is shrinking to the point where some restaurants have taken the sandwich off their dollar menu and are charging more for it a few other stores have abandoned most or all of the cheaper food lineup one franchisee called the hefty burger "a loss leader " he calculated that after food paper labor rent other overhead plus the service fee he pays mcdonalds the item isnt profitable for him the dollar menu has become so contentious that the head of mcdonalds national leadership council of franchisees don armstrong recently disclosed in an email to colleagues "the desire to find a new value platform that will continue to bring customers in and maintain our competitive value leadership "we hate the fact that the dollar menu double cheese burger is the foundation" of that position mr armstrong wrote "but the fact is it works everything else that has been tried has failed " the email said efforts are under way "to explore options and research consumers to find the right replacement strategy " asked to comment mcdonalds spokesman william whitman said there are no immediate plans to replace the double cheeseburger on the dollar menu "our franchisees overwhelmingly support the dollar menu as well as our overall value menu strategy " he said even so some mcdonalds stores around the u s have rebelled in yakima wash for example restaurants charge &# for the two patty two cheese slices sandwich and have put in its place on the dollar menu a single patty bacon cheeseburger another franchisee in california says he is now charging &# for the double cheeseburger "it doesnt make sense" he says of the &# price "now i dont get people coming in just getting a double cheese and a glass of water " said the franchisee who asked not to be named "ive eliminated that customer i dont want " and while the number of sandwiches he sells is down from when it was on the dollar menu "now were making a profit on it " moreover people dont complain about the higher price he added "they understand about the commodities " because under its licensing agreement mcdonalds cant mandate what its franchisees charge the dollar menu is a suggested price list and not all markets feature the menu restaurants around new york have no hamburgers on their dollar menus if they have the menu at all a spot check found double cheeseburgers cost more than &# at several manhattan mcdonalds one mcdonalds franchisee suggested that to unfetter itself from a specific price the company rename it "the
