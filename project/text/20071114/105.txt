return to spender congressional democrats spent the fall preparing for their budget confrontation with the white house and the strategy they seem to have settled on is futility they knew president bush would veto their first appropriations bill as he did yesterday and they also knew theyd lack the votes for an override if theyre wondering why the bottoms fallen out of their approval ratings here it is mr bush said the bill exceeds "reasonable and responsible levels for discretionary spending " and he was being too kind ostensibly the &# billion "minibus" combining funding for the departments of labor health and human services and education is "only" &# billion beyond the presidents budget request for discretionary spending but thats more than half of the &# billion that democrats want to spend for above the administrations top line that &# billion by the way swells to at least &# billion in additional outlays over five years democrats are already feigning outrage house appropriations kingpin david obey complained "there has been virtually no criticism of its contents " and if hes only referring to congress hes not far off the bill marks a return to capitol hills earmarks as usual spending culture assuming it ever abated there are more than earmarks worth some &# billion the pork includes &# million for the afl cio working for america institute and &# million for the afl cio appalachian council theres &# for a "virtual herbarium" in new york and &# for a utah "ice center " also check off &# million for the clinton school of public service in little rock and another &# million for the thomas daschle center for public service and representative democracy at south dakota state university plus the usual assorted millions for art centers aquariums aviation and jazz museums and so forth the members also reverted to habit by using a house senate conference to "airdrop" &# million in earmarks that were not included in earlier editions in violation of the ethics "reform " the conference also clandestinely removed a provision barring federal funding for the "hippies museum" near woodstock all of this from democrats who rode into the majority promising to restore "fiscal discipline " mr obey was especially instructive in a speech immediately before the final house vote "i would ask every serious minded person in this body if they really think there is a chance of a snowball in hades that members earmarks on either side of the aisle will survive if we wind up at the presidents level of funding " he concluded "the fate of every project is in your hands " the democrats were desperate for a veto proof majority and for the sake of their earmarks some republicans were content to go along the pork of course was cover for much larger domestic spending excesses including a &# billion budget gimmick for "advance appropriations" designed to circumvent democratic "pay as you go" budget rules thankfully enough gop members realized it and maybe a few even hoped to recover their credibility on spending since there arent enough votes to override mr bush its back to the drawing board maybe next time democrats should try something new say spending less money
