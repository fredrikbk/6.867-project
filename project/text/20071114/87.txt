oil falls to &# as data suggest demand shift early signs of an easing in global demand growth and swings by wall street traders are pushing oil away from the historic &# a barrel mark at least for now after rising as high as &# a barrel a week ago the benchmark oil futures price on the new york mercantile exchange hit a low of &# yesterday before closing at &# a one day drop of &# over the next few years supplies are likely to be tight and demand is expected to keep rising a security scare cutoff in supply or shift in sentiment could send prices soaring again but traders have begun taking into account other factors that could complicate the near term outlook the international energy agency the industrialized worlds energy watchdog said yesterday it was lowering its prediction for global demand growth for the fourth quarter easing fears of a short term supply crunch meanwhile some officials at the organization of petroleum exporting countries have said it may consider raising its production ceiling next month wall streets speculators who contributed to oils rise since the beginning of the year have shifted direction this week yesterday marked the expiration of a key deadline in the crude oil options markets as it became clear that oil wouldnt hit &# a barrel by the deadline a chain reaction of selling ensued as traders unwound bets pegged to the risk of &# oil in riyadh the de facto leader of opec saudi arabian oil minister ali naimi argued strenuously against "the pessimists " who he said have driven up prices by predicting supply shortages as demand in emerging markets soars repeating a frequent lament of oil industry officials mr naimi told reporters "the price today has really no reflection whatsoever with the fundamentals" of supply and demand such statements have a political dimension saudi arabian officials are eager to deflect the notion that they bear the blame for higher oil prices and need to boost output in response oil producers have stressed other factors such as the falling dollar geopolitical jitters and market speculation still the international energy agencys monthly report suggested the worlds oil supply demand balance may have a little more give than initially thought the iea said it was lowering its prediction for global demand growth for the fourth quarter by barrels a day due mainly to signs of weakening demand in the u s and the countries of the former soviet union the iea added that world oil supply rose in october by million barrels a day one surprise performer was iraq where output from its northern fields is expected this month to top barrels a day the highest level since the u s invaded iraq in the agency noted increased production from angola a new opec member emerging as an important supplier of crude to the u s opec countries supply around of the worlds oil demand which now runs at just over million barrels a day demand for oil has continued to climb in the developing world and it has held fairly steady in the west despite soaring prices but the iea said "strong indications" are now emerging that "high prices are depressing demand" in industrialized countries this year many wall street trading desks had sold options to investors including hedge funds to buy oil at &# a barrel according to a report by lehman brothers holdings inc these investors were betting that oil would top the century mark and they could turn a profit by exercising the options the closer oil crept to &# the more investment banks had been buying oil to hedge the risk of losses on the contracts lehman contended then on monday oil opened sharply lower and stayed down as traders digested the chance of an opec production rise and slowing fuel demand amid a shaky u s economy nearly a third of all options to buy crude at &# on the new york mercantile exchange were set to expire yesterday and it became clear that the options were likely to end up worthless suddenly wall street firms didnt have to buy oil as a hedge says lehman analyst adam robinson and prices plunged gasoline demand in the u s is still growing but some data suggest the growth rate has slowed considerably department of energy data show a four week average of u s gasoline demand is growing at slightly less than compared with year earlier levels in the s an era of inexpensive fuel annual growth was more in the to range says citigroup inc energy analyst tim evans willis shaw express a trucking firm based in elm springs ark that runs a fleet of refrigerated trucks has taken action since early this year to curb fuel use "the no thing weve done to save fuel is cut back on the speed of our trucks " says chris kozak president the company has started using "governors" on its truck engines that limit them to a top speed of miles an hour while that may slow shipments somewhat mr kozak says the math makes sense he estimates that when a truck reduces its speed by one mile per hour it gains two tenths of a mile per gallon in fuel economy citigroups mr evans says such reactions by fuel consumers could have been predicted "all of the talk about &# oil was really just a distraction away from the failure of the data to confirm the surge in demand that the bulls had been touting " he says gasoline prices at the pump are just now catching up with the sharp rise of oil prices in recent months so this weeks drop by itself isnt likely to bring relief to american consumers high energy prices remain a big concern weighing on the u s economy paul horsnell energy analyst with barclays capital said western demand is less relevant than growing demand in emerging markets he also noted that third quarter results from international oil companies show falling output suggesting that sluggish supply is likely to continue pushing prices up "we still think the average price will be higher next year than this year " he says mr naimi has left open the possibility of opec raising its output ceiling next month when the blocs ministers meet but he ruled out any such discussion this week as opec heads of state are gathering in riyadh for a summit algerias energy minister chakib khelil interviewed at an energy conference in rome doubted opec would act next month "if were seeing slower demand now thats an argument for not increasing output " he said u s energy secretary samuel bodman speaking at the same conference again called for opec to raise production if demand for oil is slowing in the u s mr bodman told reporters "i havent seen it " saudi arabia is keen to use the media spotlight this week to drive home the point that it has plenty of oil to go around and that its supplies arent dwindling as some analysts have argued in recent years the countrys national oil company aramco has sponsored media tours to its headquarters in dhahran to a huge new petrochemical complex along the red sea and to one of its longstanding oil fields which the company is now looking to expand by far opecs largest oil producer saudi arabia now has around million barrels a day in capacity mr naimi said that despite rising production costs the country was on schedule to boost its capacity to million barrels a day by timothy aeppel guy chazan and peter fritsch contributed to this article
