me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q i own a buick riviera my neighbor a car enthusiast said "dont sell that car " asserting that todays auto magazines are targeting the riviera as a future collectible have i found gold or just a year old car dan collins baltimore a the rivieras rounded shape and sleek long tail styling make it an especially interesting year old car and you should hang on to it if you enjoy driving it but i dont think it will become a collectible anytime soon most cars even exotic ones are just "used" after years this is reflected in the many stories about ferraris and other rare sports cars selling for a few thousand dollars in the energy crunched s even the most sought after muscle cars had to wait to years before fetching &# million and more at auction since thousands of rivieras with similar styling were made for the through model years they arent likely to ever be rare enough to demand huge prices that might be different if you owned a special version with unusually high performance or rare luxury features but even the supercharged versions of the riviera werent known for scorching the asphalt only the last rivieras made as models and known as silver arrows may be worth a small premium q with a new dog and infant were in the market for a crossover type vehicle weve narrowed it down to the buick enclave mazda cx and the bmw x all fall into our budget and are plenty powerful and spacious my intuition is that the mazda is ultimately less expensive over time given the pricey parts and labor on a bmw and the lower reliability and newness of the buick if we plan to keep the vehicle for four years which one would financially be the best deal john fanguy alexandria va a i would narrow the field to the buick and mazda i have driven both and found them roomy smooth riding and enjoyable to drive the x seems rough pricey small and homely in comparison yes the x is a sportier drive with a better sounding engine that produces sharper acceleration but that wont mean much when youre hauling the family on an hours long road trip the cx and enclave are closely matched during test drives i thought the mazda felt a bit more like a drivers car with a firmer ride and a higher degree of tightness in the steering but the buick was the more comfortable of the two
