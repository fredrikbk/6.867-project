eu telecoms may see central oversight brussels the european commission proposed creating a single pan european union telecommunications authority as part of a larger proposal to change the way telecom companies are regulated in the nation bloc the executive and regulatory arm of the european union also called for giving national regulators the power to force dominant telecom operators to split their networks and their customer service divisions into separate business units allowing competitors easier access to network infrastructure the proposals which had been expected face fierce opposition from national regulators and other critics who argue that it will create a new layer of bureaucracy both proposals must now go to the european parliament and the council of national ministers for approval they are expected to come into effect in although many experts say they are likely to be thoroughly diluted because of the strong opposition the pan eu telecom regulator which eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding said would be called the european telecom market authority would include the national regulators on its board and be managed by an executive director appointed for five years it would make decisions based on majority voting meaning that any national regulator could in theory be forced to adopt measures in its domestic market with which it did not agree if those measures were supported by a majority of its peers all decisions taken by the body including decisions on how to punish operators that violate eu rules could be changed by the commission currently the commission can only issue nonbinding opinions if it objects to actions taken by national regulators the commission said creating a new body would prevent issues of cross border interest from "being dealt with in different ways " it argued that the eus national regulators which have scrambled in recent years to comply with brussels calls for more coherent decision making have "failed in spite of many efforts and good intentions" to align their regulatory decisions the call to let national regulators force the breakups of dominant operators is also expected to be fought against particularly by national governments looking to preserve national phone companies the commission says forced breakups would be a last resort aimed at injecting more competition into local markets and bring down costs for consumers but major companies in the industry warn that the threat of functional separation will create uncertainty and hurt investment in new technologies
