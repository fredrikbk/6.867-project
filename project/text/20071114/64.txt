asked" them not to contact her about the clothing line or the contract they view mr jermyn as a "business partner" and say they make sure hes aware of how his image is being used "he knows everything thats going on " says mr ackerman noting that mr jermyn nixed a set of promotional photos because he didnt like his outfit and thought he "looked a little puffy " in conversation mr jermyn speaks

jermyn "our michael jordan" and is looking into a trademark for "the crazy robertson" name and logo ms jermyn meanwhile has different hopes "i dont want to see my brother get hurt " she says "theyre
