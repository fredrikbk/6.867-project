on mileage car makers offer a hybrid message los angeles touting a hydrogen powered chevrolet a lincoln with a super efficient gasoline engine and a hybrid dodge car makers plan to use the los angeles auto show this week to demonstrate that theyre on a fast track to delivering vehicles that offer dramatically improved fuel economy but in washington where the rules on reducing gasoline consumption are made car makers are fighting to block the toughest proposal under consideration for raising federal mileage standards "theyre definitely saying one thing to congress and one thing to consumers " says phyllis cuttino director of the pew campaign for fuel efficiency an environmental group lobbying for tougher fuel efficiency rules just last week an alliance of environmental groups took on toyota motor corp which often is praised for its gas electric hybrid technology in a full page ad in usa today for opposing the mileage proposal the delicate minuet of marketing and lobbying shows how car makers are bowing toward pressure for earth friendly fuel efficient autos while at the same time tiptoeing around the fact that fuel thirsty trucks and sport utility vehicles are big sellers auto makers reject suggestions that their marketing and lobbying messages are inconsistent for years the industry flatly opposed any increases in federal fuel efficiency rules known as corporate average fuel economy or cafe but now they are willing to accept higher standards so long as they set separate standards for cars and trucks and allow adequate time to meet mileage targets said dave mccurdy head of the alliance of automobile manufacturers the main lobbying group for detroits big three auto makers and toyota among others "the position that were supporting in cafe is a dramatic increase over any proposal that many in congress even the advocates in their wildest dreams wouldve hoped for " he says the bevy of fuel efficient technologies on display in los angeles shows auto makers are "putting their money where their mouth is " he adds the dissonance reflects new realities in both the political arena and the marketplace the senate passed a bill in june that would require auto makers to achieve an average of miles per gallon across their fleets by a boost from current standards house and senate lawmakers are currently meeting to draw up a new fuel economy measure for inclusion in a final energy bill higher standards are likely to become an issue in the presidential race last week democratic hopeful sen hillary clinton upped the ante calling for a mpg standard by and mpg by but general motors corp chief executive rick wagoner said this summer that the standards congress is pushing "dont look achievable " ford motor co chief executive alan mulally picked up a similar theme later saying washingtons regulatory scheme on mileage is the most "market distorting" policy hes ever seen the auto industry supports a bill that would give it more time to meet a lower target and allow light pickups and suvs to receive separate lower standards the measure would require auto makers fleets to average between mpg and mpg by and give regulators discretion to determine whether annual mileage increases are "feasible " auto makers contend tougher regulations wont necessarily get americans to switch to more fuel efficient vehicles and point to americans love for their trucks nearly of octobers u s auto sales were pickup trucks and suvs while hybrids grabbed only a share according to autodata corp at the same time though consumers are placing greater importance on fuel economy and how "green" auto makers appear amid increasing concern about high gas prices global warming and u s dependence on foreign oil octobers small car sales increased over last year meanwhile suvs fell detroit auto makers have suffered under the perception that they lagged in environmental prowess despite years of research and development mr wagoner has said that the domestic car industry spends &# billion annually in research and development topping any other sector "i think there was a sense that we were not effectively getting our message out " says beth lowery gms vice president of environment energy and safety building off a new ad campaign that touts chevrolet as going from "gas friendly to gas free " gm vice chairman robert lutz is expected to unveil a string of alternative fuel cars in los angeles including hybrid versions of its silverado pickup tahoe suv and new malibu sedan as well as the volt electric plug in prototype in addition gm will promote "project driveway " in which everyday drivers will get the use of a chevy equinox suv powered by hydrogen fuel cells fords mr mulally is expected to highlight the "high volume" possibilities of gasoline turbocharged direct injection or gtdi a technology that allows smaller more efficient engines to get the power of larger motors ford sees gtdi as a less expensive solution to improving fuel economy than diesel engines though diesel is part of the companys plans the dearborn mich auto maker will install gtdi on its new lincoln mks luxury sedan one of the ford models that will make its debut at todays show but not until several months after the model is launched next summer also at the show chrysler llc plans to show off its aspen and dodge durango hybrid suvs which will be in showrooms in the middle of next year meanwhile toyota which is unveiling its latest fuel cell efforts in los angeles finds itself in the unaccustomed position of having to defend its record as a recent newspaper ad campaign asked "which is the real toyota " "toyota markets itself as a forward looking friend of the environment and its popular prius hybrid does get great gas mileage " the ad says "but behind the scenes in washington d c the company is moving backward " toyota spokeswoman martha voss counters "it is not inconsistent or hypocritical to be marketing the most advanced technologies available in todays market and pursuing advanced technologies while simultaneously supporting challenging yet realistic legislative and regulatory mechanisms that are achievable from an engineering standpoint and will satisfy customer demand "
