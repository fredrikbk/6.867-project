alternative fuels speed bumps as oil prices threaten to hit &# a barrel and governments seek to introduce tighter controls on air pollution a cheaper alternative resource that can be turned into less polluting road fuels should look like a winner but just as the technology to convert natural gas into high quality diesel seems most worthwhile as an alternative to conventional petroleum the sector has stumbled with some of its biggest projects beset by technical problems or canceled because of high construction costs "by the end of last year it looked as if we had five major projects coming to fruition " said alex forbes a consultant at industry advisory service gas strategies "in we had something of a reality check the prospect for a major new gas to liquids project being finalized in the next year or two looks not too good " he said the technology isnt new the process to convert natural gas into liquid fuels was invented in the s but commercial scale application began in the s as world energy demand rose and the technology became cost effective as a way of developing natural gas resources stranded a long way from major markets gas to liquids plants produce clean burning diesel road fuel naphtha which is used as a petrochemical feedstock lubricants and waxes these products are of better quality than standard petroleum derived products and can be sold at a higher price one example is royal dutch shell plcs high performance v power diesel that fueled audis le mans rally victories in and and typically sells at a premium of around to regular diesel at the pump increasingly the technology has also been seen as an answer to many of the worlds energy concerns the rising price and depleting reserves of oil air pollution and the lack of alternative fuels for transport gas prices are much lower than oil rajnish goswami vice president of gas and power consulting at wood mackenzie estimates that oryx gtl a joint venture between south africas sasol ltd and state owned qatar petroleum pays &# to &# per barrel of oil equivalent for its natural gas compared with the current price of around &# a barrel for benchmark crude oil futures on the new york mercantile exchange even if the long term price of oil were to fall to &# a barrel a big gtl project like shell and qatar petroleums pearl plant should make &# billion in profit before tax over its lifetime mr goswami said environmental considerations are also a selling point diesel produced from natural gas can reduce fuel consumption and emissions of nitrous oxide and soot from a cars exhaust compared with regular diesel said frank seyfried technology manager for fuels at volkswagen ag "we see a to carbon dioxide emissions reduction potential for gtl fuels " he said gtl diesel can also be used in standard engines and transported using existing infrastructure unlike other petroleum alternatives such as biofuels or hydrogen "we are not asking consumers to take a leap of faith and we are not asking car manufacturers to invest in new technology " said malcolm wells communications manager at a gtl joint venture between sasol and chevron corp gas reserves are also projected to last more than years at current production rates compared with estimates of just over years for oil these arguments have spurred the development of the worlds two biggest gtl plants both in the gas rich emirate of qatar in the persian gulf oryx gtl which started this year should eventually produce barrels a day of gtl fuels and barrels a day of liquefied petroleum gas pearl gtl due to start in will produce up to barrels a day of gtl fuels and barrels a day of lpg the ramp up of production at oryx has been delayed because its product was contaminated by catalyst particles that were clogging up filters sasol says it has solved the problem at a cost of &# million but wont say when the plant will reach capacity qatars energy minister abdullah al attiyah said recently that he expects oryx production to reach barrels a day by the end of the year the completion of the two projects in qatar will increase the worlds gtl production by almost fivefold but it is still just a drop in the ocean of road fuels consumed every day so far the only other major gtl project under construction today is chevron led escravos gtl a copy of the oryx plant that will begin construction in the niger delta next year "three years ago we would have predicted having more projects and the industry would be further ahead " said mr wells all kinds of energy projects are suffering runaway cost inflation due to labor and materials shortages expensive and complex projects like gtl have been hit hard exxonmobil corp this year canceled plans to build a barrel a day gtl plant in qatar due to the high cost of construction and questions over the availability of gas algeria dropped plans to build a barrel a day plant this year also on the grounds of cost there is speculation that the cost of shells pearl project will be higher than the &# billion to &# billion price tag the company has put on it which is three times initial estimates mr forbes of gas strategies said he expected the project ultimately to cost in excess of &# billion high costs and technical problems dont help gtl to compete with other more established gas development technologies "unquestionably the technical risk in liquefied natural gas is lower " said mr goswami of wood mackenzie "there is a far bigger subset of companies with experience of lng than gtl lng is a global industry with lots of players and multiple supply sources " lng is gas cooled to minus degrees celsius and shipped in oceangoing tankers it is sold primarily to large utilities and manufacturers at a lower price than road fuels a person involved in the finance of large energy projects said the high cost and additional complexity of gtl projects which involve numerous highly specialized partners and technologies are of growing relevance in the wake of the global credit crisis that has highlighted the importance of pricing risk correctly people in the industry acknowledge these problems but say they arent insurmountable initial technical problems can be overcome said guy de kort general manager of global xtl development at shell he added that the companys bintulu plant in indonesia is now operating at reliability despite early technical problems and an explosion that shut down the plant between and mr wells said sasol chevrons successful marketing of higher quality gtl diesel and the premium at which it can be sold over regular fuel is convincing gas resource holders that gtl is a worthwhile diversification option mr wells said sasol chevron remains bullish that gtl can continue to grow and wont just be a niche technology plans to scale production at oryx up above barrels a day remain on the agenda he said although he wouldnt give a timetable sasol chevron is also doing a prefeasibility study for a project in western australia he said "events in qatar will influence what we see as the future prospects of the gtl industry " said mr goswami a solution to oryxs problems in the next months and the completion of pearl on time and on budget will be critical not just for sasol and shell "but for pretty much the whole gtl industry " he said
