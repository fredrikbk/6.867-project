the mossberg solution singing a new zune microsofts retooled player marks a vast improvement however its still no ipod last year when microsoft corp introduced its zune music player to take on apples ipod juggernaut the software giant struck out while the zune had a good user interface and a larger screen than the ipod it was bigger and boxier with clumsier controls weaker battery life and more complex software its companion online music store had a much smaller catalog a more complicated purchase process and no videos for sale and the zunes most innovative feature built in wi fi networking was nearly useless and added little value to the players which sold so poorly that apple barely noticed but microsoft is nothing if not persistent and this week the company is back with a second improved round of zunes the chunky older gigabyte model remains in the lineup but its joined by a slimmed down full size zune that holds gigabytes and by a much smaller model that holds four or eight gigabytes prices range from &# to &# the gigabyte zune is available only in black and the others come in red green black and pink weve been testing these new zunes and find them to be notably better than last years entry they are smaller lighter and more attractive and they include three big improvements first is a new controller called a zune pad that combines buttons with a touch pad for scrolling second is a completely overhauled simpler pc software program and online store the zune marketplace third is expanded usability of the built in wi fi which allows you to synchronize your zune and your pc without plugging in a cable and makes sharing songs between zunes its only function last year slightly better unfortunately for microsoft apple hasnt been standing still either it now has its own large screen wireless model the ipod touch with a radical "multi touch" interface like the iphones the screen on the touch is larger than the one on the bigger zunes and is much sharper its wi fi allows you to browse the web watch youtube videos and even buy music without a pc none of which is possible on a zune though the touch is &# more and holds much less content than the new full size zune microsofts new zunes are directly aimed at the ipod classic apples full size high capacity model and the ipod nano its compact version but here again apple has been on the move the gigabyte classic which costs the same as the gigabyte zune is slimmer than the zune and has a flashy new interface if a smaller screen and the eight gigabyte nano which costs the same as the eight gigabyte zune now plays videos and is much smaller yet has a larger screen neither of these ipods includes wi fi in addition apple has spiffed up its itunes software adding various features including the addictive cover flow which allows you to flip through all your albums with just a flick of the mouse cover flow also shows up on the nano the classic and the touch even the new zune pc software has no interface as compelling and apple still trounces microsoft in the selection of media it sells the itunes store offers more than six million songs about double what the zune marketplace offers and dwarfs microsofts selection of podcasts and music videos as well plus zune marketplace still doesnt sell any tv shows movies or audiobooks while itunes does overall we still dont think the zune line beats the ipods and itunes however one of the zunes the full size zune could give the ipod some competition especially among new digital player buyers who arent invested in the itunes ecosystem for the same price it offers a significantly larger screen albeit with the same resolution wireless syncing and sharing and a built in fm radio an existing zune feature that the ipod lacks we tested the &# gigabyte zune against apples ipod classic with the same capacity and price and then did the same for the &# eight gigabyte zune compared with the ipod nano equivalent we didnt get a chance to test the battery life on the new zune models or that of the ipod classic and nano but microsoft concedes that unless you turn off wi fi one of the zunes key advantages its claimed battery life is lower than apples claims microsoft estimates as many as and hours of music playback with wi fi on for the eight and gigabyte respectfully apple claims as many as hours and hours respectively on the competitive models which lack wi fi in the past apple has generally understated its battery claims while last year microsoft overstated its claims on both zunes the front hosts just three buttons the zune pad a back button and a play pause button its menus are divided into music videos pictures social radio podcasts and settings navigating through this menu list and hundreds of songs is made easier with the zune pads touch functions to zip through a list we flicked a finger up or down the top bottom right and left sides each work as individual buttons as does the center of the zune pad the user interface is mainly unchanged from last year and still works very well requiring an economical number of steps for each action zunes black red and green colors are fine but rather masculine the latter reminded us of camouflage but the pink was a glaring shade more appropriate for my little pony it looks like an afterthought we initiated wireless syncs with the zune software program plugging the player into our pc the first time but leaving it disconnected each time after that wireless syncing took a little longer than with a cord and must be initiated by the user from within the players settings one frustration presumably to save battery life the zune disconnects from the network periodically and then must reconnect the next time you want to use the wi fi also the zune cant wirelessly sync if youre at a public hot spot that requires you to log in or pay this years zunes also introduce a concept microsoft intends to build on intelligent or automated syncing if you have your zune set to sync only some of your music not all and drag an artists name onto the zune icon in the pc software the software will thereafter automatically sync every song you add to the pc from that artist microsoft believes many people would welcome such automation the zunes fm radio is well designed and easy to use using the zune pad to flick left or right along the station grid our zunes detected numerous static free stations and we marked certain stations as presets by holding down the center button each radios digital data appeared on screen including the artist and song title we shared songs between our zunes beaming tracks from the gigabyte to the eight gigabyte and vice versa a wirelessly shared song can be played by the recipient three times whenever they choose microsoft has removed the three day time limit that applied last year a minute of playing time or half the duration of a song whatever comes first constitutes one play at first it took our zunes a couple tries to recognize one another even though they were both set to share music and we noted that invitations to accept shared music dont include any information about the music so you could get stuck downloading an annoying tune or one you already own photos and videos looked great on the zunes about as good as they do on the comparable ipod nanos and better than on the ipod classic because that ipod models screen is much smaller than its zune counterparts however album art which is often lower resolution than normal photos looked grainier on the big zune than on the big ipod and none of the zunes came close to the stunning photo and video quality offered on the ipod touch and the iphone we didnt get to test zunes a la carte point system for buying and downloading tracks because it wasnt up and running yet neither were music video downloads we each had zune pass accounts which work like subscriptions if the zune account stops all content acquired during the users subscription is lost navigating through zunes software can be a tad confusing four categories at the top left of your pcs screen are meant to help collection device marketplace and social collection shows your downloaded or owned content and focuses a bit too much on albums which are becoming less significant with the ever growing popularity of digital music one example of this is the collections default center panel shows album art sorted by date added zune marketplaces artist pages really shine upon selecting a band or artist a rich full screen background image of that group or person appears on the page with lists of songs floating atop the image various still photos of each artist are included we found for mary chapin carpenter and for nelly furtado after listening to a yo yo ma album in her music collection katie wanted to download additional performances of the famous cellist from the zune marketplace online store but unlike itunes zunes software program doesnt offer a way to link directly from your collection to marketplace for buying more of a certain artist or another song from an album you already own another navigational hiccup in zunes marketplace is its inability to bookmark searches if after searching in zunes online store to buy and download more yo yo ma katie looked in her collection to see which piece she played last or liked most then returned to the online store her marketplace store search would be lost and shed need to start over the itunes store bookmarks your place during searches allowing you to navigate through any other part of itunes before returning to the idle search zune tries to compensate for this glitch by identifying songs in the online store that you already own either bought through zune marketplace or from other sources with an "in collection" label so you dont accidentally buy content you already own likewise if a song in your collection is already synched to be on the player a tiny zune icon appears beside that song title unlike itunes zune software cant create smart playlists and it only offers two views browse and list versus three in itunes cover flow lists and lists with album art microsoft has greatly improved the zune hardware and software this time but it seems to be competing with apples last efforts not its newest ones email mossbergsolution wsj com
