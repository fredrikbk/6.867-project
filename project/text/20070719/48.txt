how fliers are coping with the summer of hell some buy backup tickets ship baggage leave at dawn and theres always the train judy magner is done with summer travel summer air travel to be precise she and her husband who live just north of toronto are considering vacationing somewhere in the u s but "we wont be going further than we can drive " she says after a recent travel debacle in which she and a business companion were trapped in chicago sleeping overnight at their gate at ohare international airport ms magner vows to avoid airports as much as she possibly can many air travelers are similarly frustrated theyre suffering through one of the worst summers for fliers in recent history in response some are devising their own strategies to make flying bearable such as buying backup tickets or booking the first flight of the day or like ms magner not flying at all by most measures airline performance dropped precipitously last month over june with more excessively late flights minutes tardy or more and fewer ontime arrivals the total on time percentage last month for the top domestic carriers fell to from in june according to the flight tracking service flightstats com the proportion of flights that were excessively late rose to from the previous june at the same time the number of cancellations more than doubled to from "its not just hurting peoples vacations and making people angry " says bill connors executive director and chief operating officer of the national business travel association "its making people lose business and hurting the american economy " the air transport association the airline industrys main trade group blames the problem on an outdated radar based air traffic control system which it is pushing the federal government to modernize doing so would cost the federal aviation administration &# billion to &# billion according to the ata and take until to be fully implemented it would also cost the airlines an estimated &# billion but the organization says its a must in order to stop the delays "we dont have an air traffic control system capable of dealing with the volume even without the weather " ata spokesman david castelveter says adding that three out of four delays are triggered by adverse weather "when you throw in the summer storm activity thats a recipe for the kind of delays were seeing today " but most travelers dont want to wait years for the system to improve in the meantime they are making adjustments and devising various strategies to cope with the vagaries of air travel tre miller rodriguez an account director at pj inc a new york based public relations firm says shes avoiding newark liberty international airport after three arrival delays there this summer two of which exceeded three hours anthony marecki a trial attorney in buffalo is getting up at the crack of dawn for a m flights to new york a trip he makes three to five times per month now he builds lost hours into each trip plan saying its become a business necessity to expect delays every time hank lauricella a financial services executive in san francisco is lengthening the trips he regularly takes to new york returning home saturday morning instead of taking his usual friday night flight after dealing with repeated two and three hour delays this solution works for now he says he used to live in new york and this allows him to have dinner with friends but he figures hell have to switch back soon once his year old sons soccer schedule starts in the fall flying early in the morning and taking supplies such as food and water aboard are among the precautionary measures that many experts advise travelers also should be aware that sunday monday and friday are particularly busy days at the airport "if youre going to fly dont fly in the afternoon because you run the risk of summer thunderstorms " says jerry chandler a travel blogger for cheapflights com "youre just asking for it " still eight of the flights he took last month were delayed significantly or canceled mr chandler says hes taking the train from washington to boston next week for a business trip even though he badly wants to pad his delta air lines skymiles frequent flier account many executives of course are used to the challenges of flying at a time when airports are brimming with vacationing families and others who arent always accustomed to the travel process "you can almost feel the seasons change inside the airports " says ben elowitz chief executive of wetpaint com inc a web site development company in seattle who generally travels at least once a week "it moves so smoothly when its business travelers but when families travel together its hard enough just to keep the kids all together much less getting their shoes off and coats off and having everyone follow the rules " mr elowitz books the first possible flight available the day of travel that also helps avoid falling prey to the cascade of delays or cancellations when a problem with one flight backs up subsequent flights "the planes usually havent had time to get screwed up at oclock in the morning " if a meeting is particularly important he buys a refundable ticket on a second airline as a backup tim blackburn a sales manager at career technologies a los angeles based electronics company says "ive recently begun spending more money up front just to keep it as convenient as possible " mr blackburn pays an extra &# per day to leave his car in the valet parking section of the airport to cut off time before and after trips he also pays higher airfares by flying as often as possible out of smaller airports such as burbanks bob hope airport instead of fighting the crowds at nearby los angeles international airport "i probably pay at least &# more per flight but its worth the time i save " he says one other trick when planning to spend more than a few days on a work assignment he ships his toiletries by overnight mail the day before that allows him to avoid having to check his luggage at the airport or buy the items upon arrival "a plastic bag full of little bottles isnt enough for a longer trip anyway " he says "and ill do anything not to check my bags " many travelers though are opting for the most foolproof solution of all not flying rob koch a brooklyn n y field services supervisor for package delivery company dhl says he drove miles to wilmington n c to visit a friend last month he figured that given how arduous air travel is this summer thered be little advantage to getting on a plane "you already know theres going to be a delay " he says judy magners nightmare began july when she and a colleague tried to fly from toronto to salt lake city through chicago on united airlines they work for draco associates ltd a medical consulting firm based in newmarket ontario and had meetings scheduled with a client that afternoon but the first leg of their trip an a m flight from toronto to ohare was delayed two hours because the first officer got in late the night before by the time ms magner and her co worker got to ohare they had missed their connection so they pushed their meetings back a day the pair went downtown for lunch and returned to the airport in time for the next available flight to salt lake city scheduled for p m but then it was delayed and ultimately canceled due to weather says united after standing in line at the ticket counter until midnight and then being told the next available flight was the following evening the two women decided to catch a flight back to toronto early the next morning the client meetings would have to wait but the womens checked bags kept traveling ms magner says hers didnt arrive home until four days later after taking a detour through los angeles her co workers bag just arrived on monday five days after they left toronto "when theres bad weather we do the best we can " says united spokeswoman robin urbanski "safety is always our no priority " ms magner for her part is dreading that she still has to make up the business trip to salt lake city "ive never gotten on a plane and thought i wouldnt get where im going " she says her solution dont fly through chicago next time and dont fly at all unless absolutely necessary
