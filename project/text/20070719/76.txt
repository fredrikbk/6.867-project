politics &amp economics brazil crash casts light on global safety concerns air infrastructure fails to keep pace with traffic surge the crash of a brazilian jet that killed at least people is spotlighting brazils overburdened air infrastructure and the governments failure to confront the problem but it is also a cautionary tale for a global aviation industry that is experiencing a surge in traffic without an accompanying increase in attention to safety issues several brazilian aviation analysts are describing the crash of tam linhas aereass flight traveling to sao paulo from porto alegre brazil on tuesday as a chronicle of a tragedy foretold the accident in which the airbus skidded off a rain soaked runway at landing crossed a highway and crashed in flames into a tam building and a gas station came less than a year after another brazilian air accident claimed lives tuesdays crash the worst in brazilian aviation history also came amid brazilian congressional hearings which have been detailing systemic problems in air equipment procedures and staffing levels but safety concerns are also global in nature as countries from argentina to india witness a new generation of quickly growing airlines and a massive increase in traffic in brazil domestic passenger traffic is expected to grow this year compared with average growth of world wide according to research by the international air transport association an industry group investment in infrastructure hasnt kept up with greater passenger volumes which brazils airport administration agency says are up about since "youve got storm clouds on the horizon and those clouds are growth " says jim hall a former chairman of the national transportation safety board under president clinton now working as a consultant and lobbyist in washington "you run out of qualified people and capacity to provide a safe system " although the crash is bound to promote passenger concerns about latin american air safety it follows marked improvements in recent years in the regions overall commercial aircraft accident rate through most of the s carriers in that part of the world had major crashes at significantly higher rates than other developing regions such as china and parts of the middle east but since then those statistics have gone down steadily in south america helped by enhanced radar coverage newer aircraft and stepped up pilot training from to boeings industrywide statistics show the accident rate for western built jetliners flown by latin american carriers staying well above three crashes for each million departures or almost ten times greater than the historic accident rate in north america on the other hand the iatas latest statistics show latin americas accident rate for heading closer to one crash per million departures making flying statistically almost as safe at least for that year as in parts of europe tuesdays crash also underscores the limited influence of international air safety groups and standards to help resolve longstanding inertia when it comes to domestic investments in aviation improvements brazils airlines and government officials participate in a regional safety umbrella group supported by boeing co airbus parent european aeronautic defence &amp space co engine makers and global safety experts but their recommendations dont entail funding for improvements and the groups have scant enforcement capabilities short of publicly embarrassing a country by releasing unflattering results of safety audits the crash at sao paulos congonhas airport the countrys busiest occurred on a runway that had been reopened june following repairs it could take months for accident investigators to pinpoint the cause of the crash but pilots have long criticized the runway for being too short and too slick when it rains one problem being discussed among brazilian aviation specialists was that repair crews hadnt cut grooves into the runway which would allow rainwater to run off the lack of grooving "was clearly an aggravating factor in the crash " an official of the brazilian federation of air traffic controllers associations said yesterday some investigators suggested that the plane was once again airborne after it slid off the runway and crossed the highway there had been two other recent skidding incidents on the runway one on monday the grooving was scheduled to be done later while u s airlines and regulators have taken various steps to reduce the hazards of so called runway excursions or overruns particularly in snowy or rainy conditions those remedial actions frequently havent been embraced elsewhere this category of accidents doesnt "typically result in a lot of fatalities" world wide according to william voss president of the industry supported flight safety foundation but "the underlying dangers can go unnoticed for long periods" and then "dramatically become deadly " depending on specific airport layouts he said brazils air industry has been in a state of tumult since september when an airliner belonging to brazils gol linhas aereas inteligentes sa crashed with people aboard after a midair collision with an executive jet feeling they were being blamed for the tragedy air traffic controllers mounted work slowdowns and demanded better conditions the slowdowns plus an overburdened air infrastructure have contributed to long delays at airports for months president luiz inacio lula da silva seemed reluctant to act decisively and his cabinet members tried to minimize the crisis with statements that only served to infuriate thousands of stranded passengers brazils tourism minister marta suplicy told passengers to try to forget about delays and "relax and enjoy " but international aviation groups had been growing increasingly concerned on jan the washington based air line pilots association issued a statement cautioning pilots over the "lack of proper governmental oversight and control of the air traffic control system" in brazilian airspace the warning cited inexperienced controllers with incomplete command of english and failures to communicate flight plan changes the rapid growth of the aviation industry means that regulators in some countries are struggling to oversee a highly competitive industry with disparate players and operations rather than traditional operations controlled by governments or big business groups "there are new types of airlines run by venture capitalists and m b a s " said mr voss of the flight safety foundation "it turns regulators on their head when you compare it to the old state airline "
