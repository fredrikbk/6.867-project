mischief unmanaged carefully plotted logistics to deliver final harry potter fail to dispel rash of leaks scholastic corp needs hermiones fabled time turner device the publisher would dearly love to go back and prevent the premature distribution of as many as copies of j k rowlings "harry potter and the deathly hallows" in the u s as well as the apparent leak online of a copy of the book despite extraordinary security measures purported potters were turning up all over yesterday one version allegedly delivered early sold for &# on ebay at least one was delivered to a home in maryland and the baltimore sun posted a brief review of the book online yesterday afternoon though it didnt explain how it obtained its copy it seemed to be going so well over the span of the seven book series as the harry potter books have exploded in popularity retailers have grown increasingly sophisticated in getting them into the hands of eager readers not a minute before their release time barnes &amp noble inc the nations largest book retailer for instance uses an algorithm to help ensure that the more than copies it ships out to individual buyers arrive on the appointed day the retailer received more than million pre orders for the book but many of those will be picked up at its stores by customers copies of "deathly hallows" began arriving at the retailers two major warehouses several weeks ago there they are separated by zip code and shipped out using a complex mathematical formula to compute exactly how long it takes to deliver a book to a specific neighborhood "we have all this built in to our system " says marie j toulantis ceo of barnes&amp noble com "we know depending on the shipper and zip code exactly how long it will take to get the book to a customers home on time " but such clockwork accuracy appears to be lacking at some other companies the baltimore sun reported yesterday that a man in maryland had received a copy early from online retailer deepdiscount com mailed from the retailers warehouses in chicago rob broggi director of merchandising at deepdiscount com described the event to the sun as a "freak accident" and said the matter was being investigated scholastic believes that deepdiscount com and its supplier chas levy co s levy home entertainment distribution arm violated their contractual obligations to ensure that "deathly hallows" went on sale no sooner than one minute after midnight on saturday in a suit filed in the circuit court of cook county ill scholastic alleged that infinity resources inc doing business as deepdiscount com shipped "deathly hallows" as much as a week "before the contractually permitted shipping date " this could explain how some readers are getting early copies despite its security efforts scholastic lost control during the virtual last leg of the process the distance between retailer and consumer "this isnt just one copy that got out by accident " says kyle good a spokeswoman for scholastic which estimated that the number of copies shipped is around "one one hundredth of one percent" of the total u s copies ms good added that the number could be considerably less "were asking for damages but cant yet quantify them " says lisa holton president of scholastic trade and book fairs neither levy home entertainment nor deepdiscount com would comment as for the book auctioned on ebay kim ruby a spokeswoman for ebay inc said that "this transaction abided by the policies at ebay " but they were looking into it further ms ruby added that "there is no way for us to verify " whether the book is real or not many fans are upset melissa anelli who owns the leaky cauldron a popular harry potter web site said that her site is being flooded with emails from concerned readers "i cant believe the intensity of some peoples desire to ruin it for other people " she says book sellers were instructed by scholastic to keep tight lipped about the logistics of shipping the highly coveted book kim sutton the brand marketing coordinator with powells books an independent bookstore and online retailer based in portland ore said that her company cant even disclose where the books are warehoused "people might know where the books are and access them and leak them " she said scholastic offered powells books two options for shipping the book either agree to use fedex corp to distribute the books in time for the saturday release or wait and use any carrier they chose to deliver the book after the release date the latter option would have meant that some of powells customers wouldnt be able to get a copy until a week after its release date powells agreed to let fedex handle the shipping "fedex is ultimately responsible for the routing of the books so that they arrive on the exact day " ms sutton said carla boyd a spokeswoman for fedex wouldnt confirm the companys agreement with powells and scholastic saying that the company doesnt comment on their business partners practices the companys fedex freight unit expects to deliver million books to bookstores across the country ms boyd said the company is using a variety of safeguards to ensure that the books arent stolen or shipped ahead of saturdays release including placing the books in unmarked boxes using cameras to record the books and having an internal security force that accompanies the books every step of the way those familiar with the direct mail business werent shocked that some customers have gotten early copies but said some would be upset "this is a big oops " says denny hatch who writes an enewsletter called businesscommonsense com john schulte president of minneapolis based national mail order association a professional organization of people involved in direct marketing says mistakes happen "everything is run by humans and if somebody typed in the wrong ship date then you have a problem " he says even the author seems unhappy in a posting yesterday on her web site jkrowling com ms rowling wrote "we are almost there as launch night looms lets all please ignore the misinformation popping up on the web and in the press on the plot of harry potter and the deathly hallows id like to ask everyone who calls themselves a potter fan to help preserve the secrecy of the plot for all those who are looking forward to reading the book at the same time on publication day in a very short time you will know everything " meanwhile scholastic continued to "actively pursue the people involved" in placing what are purported to be photographed pages of the book online in a sign that any publicity may be good publicity ms good said that "several said their reservations for their harry potter parties are spiking and they are concerned about having enough books "
