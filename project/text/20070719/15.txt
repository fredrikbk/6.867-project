chip makers watch their waste plants aim to increase output without retooling over the decades makers of computer chips have made a series of wrenching changes to their basic unit of production the silicon wafer theyre not eager to do it again soon so the semiconductor industry and its suppliers are mounting a long term campaign to wring productivity improvements from existing factories without a costly shift to larger wafers and new tools to process them industry executives say they could eventually reduce the time needed to create chips by up to and reduce wasteful practices in todays "fabs " as chip fabrication plants are known "you go into a fab and you see wafers sitting inventory sitting machines underutilized " michael splinter chief executive of santa clara calif chip tool maker applied materials inc said during an analyst meeting this week "we just think there are years and years and years of enhanced productivity that can be achieved " some of the concepts can be compared to baking chips are formed on wafers using recipes of minerals gases and chemicals that are applied with processing machines that cost millions of dollars each just as more cookies can be baked on a larger cookie sheet so larger wafers yield more chips in the same amount of time spreading the costs of tools gases and chemicals over a larger wafer surface also reduces the money spent for creating each chip yet larger wafers demand the equivalent of costly new ovens machines that trace lines of circuitry add or etch away metals and other materials developing manufacturing tools can take years and huge investments makers of such machines spent an estimated &# billion developing tools for the current generation of wafers for those reasons companies have incentives to increase wafer sizes but not often many manufacturers that had been using wafers with diameters of millimeters or about eight inches have built production lines using wafers that are millimeters across each of which can be used to create hundreds of chips the shift begun in the late s was delayed by the internet bust total millimeter production capacity is expected to surpass millimeter production for the first time next year the new efficiency campaign "mm prime " is a hot topic this week at a san francisco trade show called semicon west that draws makers of chip manufacturing tools and materials it is being spearheaded in part by the international sematech manufacturing initiative or ismi an offshoot of the u s consortium sematech besides u s chip manufacturers such as intel corp international business machines corp and advanced micro devices inc ismi members include big asian chip makers such as nec corp taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co and hitachi ltd unit renesas technology shanghai co infineon technologies ag of germany is also a member some participants hope to address mistakes made during the millimeter transition one questionable choice was building processing systems around modules that carry lots of wafers says doug gross director of manufacturing technology for amd if one machine needs minutes to process a lot of that size smaller lots of wafers or so could theoretically be processed in around half the time by two machines bottlenecks associated with large lots are particularly glaring for build to order companies called foundries which make many different chips using the same tools the rising importance of consumer devices such as cellphones and digital music players which require low priced chips and have short life cycles increase the appeal of smaller lots that could allow chip manufacturers to switch among products quickly and hold down inventories of unsold products some chip makers have responded by placing just wafers in modules designed for sending half empty containers around the factory says tom abell a former intel engineer involved in the mm prime effort at the ismi consortium "they are moving lots of air around " he says developing systems for handling smaller lots of wafers is a primary goal of mm prime another objective is to better manage delivery of lots so wafers spend less time waiting for processing one hurdle is that for a variety of reasons processing machines often arent ready when wafers arrive for processing in many cases the wait is only two or three minutes while a new production recipe is downloaded to a processing tool for example but such delays add up the goal mr gross says is to develop software that schedules automatic delivery of wafers just as a tool is ready thats a tall order but amd claims improvements in its management systems since have increased the capacity of its production lines by without installing new equipment if wafers that might ordinarily take days to process could move through a factory in half that time as backers of the mm prime effort hope the effect could be dramatic on chips with a profitable life of six months or so says scott kramer director of the ismi consortium but even backers acknowledge that mm prime wont yield the level of cost cuts that larger wafers can executives at intel the worlds largest chip maker consequently predict that a shift to millimeter wafers will be needed eventually and say they arent likely to make changes to their millimeter factories that need new sets of tools mr abell thinks mm prime can serve as a foundation for the larger wafer size not likely to arrive before or so by developing more efficient practices that can also help manufacturers now mr gross adds "we have got to change how we do manufacturing "
