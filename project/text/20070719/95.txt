tax fraud travesty for of the people due to stand trial in what the government has called the largest criminal tax fraud case in history this week offered a respite if not an end to their two year long ordeal on monday a federal judge lewis a kaplan dismissed all charges against the former employees of kpmg having found that the prosecutors had violated the fifth and sixth amendment rights of the accused but like tom wolfes sherman mccoy in "the bonfire of the vanities " even those must feel as if they are becoming professional defendants the u s attorney has shown every sign that he intends to appeal the dismissal and if the government loses that appeal there is always the supreme court where the constitutional claims raised in this case might well prove of interest if you are a federal prosecutor thats all in a days work or in this case all in a half a decades work even if you lose youll have been doing your job and collecting your paychecks straight down the line and win or lose there is almost certainly in the time honored practice a job at a private law firm awaiting you when you hang up your government spurs but what if you are one of the accused the attorney general could call off the dogs but with alberto gonzales already embroiled in a pseudo scandal over the u s attorney firings youre probably better off betting on a miracle than on mr gonzaless taking an active hand in this case so wait for the appeal to be filed and then its once more into the breach the possibility that you may stand trial on charges that could put you in jail for decades has been attenuated but not removed by the dismissal of the charges against you your life remains in limbo and could stay there for years in the meantime you pay your lawyers and you hope thats what mr wolfe meant by the phrase "professional defendant " for the assistant u s attorneys going after you is their job one theyve chosen and get paid to do your job has involuntarily become stopping them but no one pays you to do that job instead you pay others through the nose while your professional possibilities dry up or at a minimum are in hiatus until your legal problems are cleared up well you may say thats what happens when you run afoul of the law no one said being accused of serious felonies was supposed to be fun or profitable but these considerations are particularly pertinent to the kpmg case because of the nature of the prosecutors violations of the rights of the accused when the justice department sat down with kpmg in february to inform the accounting and consulting firm that it was in deep trouble over its tax shelter marketing it raised one question right away will you pay legal fees for employees accused of wrongdoing kpmgs lawyers perhaps sensing the danger responded with a question well whats your view on the matter assistant u s attorney justin weddle responded with the now famous threat that prosecutors would look at a decision to pay the legal costs of employees "under a microscope " two years later mr weddle would stand up in court and deny that the government had attempted to influence kpmgs decision at the same time he said repeatedly in that courtroom that it was the governments policy to consider whether a company that is suspected of a crime or in mr weddles words "has committed a crime" was "protecting wrongdoers " paying those wrongdoers legal fees in mr weddles view seemed to qualify as "protecting" them a view also reflected in his "microscope" comment which was not public knowledge at the time two weeks ago judge kaplan referring to mr weddles performance at that march hearing said hed seen people convicted of false statement for less so to sum up in the view of the prosecutor in this case a company under investigation but not charged can be considered to have "committed a crime " the employees suspected of participating in the crime are "wrongdoers" undeserving of the "protection" of getting legal assistance for actions taken as part of their jobs with this as their framework the government made it perfectly clear to kpmg that paying for their employees lawyers could contribute to an indictment of the entire firm on a related note another assistant u s attorney john hillebrecht stood up in court two weeks ago and made a casual reference to kpmgs "unlimited resources " the irony is that the only party in this case with unlimited resources is the government and the government went to considerable lengths to limit the resources of those that it wanted to charge in the case now the prosecutors actions have been found by judge kaplan to have infringed the constitutional rights of the defendants those violations in turn led directly to dismissal of the case against them meanwhile the defendants have racked up legal bills averaging about &# million apiece and if the government appeals the legal meter will start ticking again further eroding the financial position of the ex defendants some of whom are already insolvent and so exacerbating the harm done by the government in this case put another way the ability of the ex defendants to fight an appeal has already been compromised by the constitutional violations found by judge kaplan appealing under these circumstances borders on the sadistic it certainly would suggest to borrow prosecutorial language a callous disregard for the victims of the prosecutors abuses the kpmg case was founded from the beginning on an aggressive and unprecedented legal theory namely that individuals could be criminally liable for selling legal tax shelters an aggressive legal theory led in its turn to aggressive legal tactics which have now been found to have infringed citizens constitutional rights in a manner that "shocks the conscience " according to judge kaplan an appeal by the government now with the hardship and additional cost it would entail would only add to the prosecutorial misconduct and even success on appeal would be tainted by the prejudice to the defendants already found by the court mr carney is a member of the editorial board of the wall street journal
