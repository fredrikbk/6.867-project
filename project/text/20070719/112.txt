web ocrats down under there the web ocrats go again this time with an assault on google the search engines latest legal troubles originate down under with a lawsuit filed by australias trading practices regulator the case could have far reaching consequences on old and new media alike in a complaint filed last week the australian competition and consumer commission alleged that google doesnt adequately distinguish between free results and ads confusing users further it charged google should be held responsible for ads with allegedly misleading content like holding an old fashioned billboard owner responsible for the posters he erects lets take these allegations in turn on the search results charge anyone whos used google knows that advertisers links are displayed above or next to the free results set apart by colored boxes or dividing lines and clearly labeled as "sponsored links " this meets guidelines issued by the u s federal trade commission in the last time any major regulatory body turned its attention to search related ads the second charge is more insidious when a consumer types a keyword into googles search engine links to advertisers who have "bought" that keyword will appear near the free search results generated by googles algorithms the aussie regulator singles out ads purchased by an online classifieds site trading post which allegedly bought keywords that were actually the names of competitors the regulator claims that when a consumer searched for "kloster ford" and "charlestown toyota " two dealerships competing with trading post which also sells used cars a trading post ad would appear in the sponsored links section trading post is googles co defendant in the case trading posts behavior is analogous to sending someone to stand next to a dealerships driveway with a sign trying to persuade consumers to look for a better deal down the road if trading posts links masqueraded as their competitors links one could argue deception occurred the court will sort out whether that happened in this case in any event google allows businesses like these aggrieved dealerships to challenge others use of their names sometimes leading to the search engine removing the offending link googles main "crime" here seems to be allowing companies to tell their competitors customers that alternative suppliers exist a billboard company or a newspaper or anyone else publishing ads cant reasonably be expected to research the accuracy of every advertisement holding the advertiser legally accountable for his own honesty has been recognized as the best way to protect consumers an aussie victory here would blow this precedent apart with a potentially chilling effect throughout the media world particularly since in in another media case dow jones v gutnick australias highest court effectively expanded the reach of australian media law around the world that case filed against this newspapers parent company allowed a libel suit to proceed in australian court for content hosted on a computer server in new jersey will every online publication displaying ads now need to bone up on australian consumer protection law no one seriously thinks australias regulator is gunning for this outcome at least not now but its intentions wont matter if it creates a monster anyway therein lies the danger of government attempts to regulate new technology existing law lets regulators go after advertisers directly for misleading consumers while if internet searchers feel themselves ill served by google they can easily take their page views elsewhere instead of protecting consumers australia risks inflicting collateral damage across the media landscape
