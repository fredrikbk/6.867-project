quake brings safety issue to fore plant standards in focus after radioactive leak japans auto output hit earthquake resistance standards for nuclear power plants are drawing increased scrutiny following mondays earthquake in japan which damaged the worlds largest nuclear power installation by output capacity meanwhile several japanese auto makers including the worlds largest by vehicle sales toyota motor corp halted production at some or all of their domestic plants because an important suppliers facilities were damaged by the earthquake showing how vulnerable the supply chain is in the auto industry japanese government officials yesterday released findings from the countrys meteorological agency that showed tokyo electric power co s kashiwazaki kariwa plant may sit directly above a fault line suggesting it may be prone to severe damage in the case of a major earthquake the fault line was the epicenter of mondays magnitude earthquake in central japan which killed nine people the quake was far stronger than what the plant was designed to withstand and caused problems including the leakage of small amounts of radioactive matters into the sea and the air along with a fire at an electric transformer outside one of the plants seven reactors tokyo electric and japanese government officials said the leakage was small and the plant weathered the quake with no problems at critical facilities still the incident caused fears that japanese nuclear power plants which supply about a third of the nations electricity needs may not be prepared to withstand the most powerful of earthquakes nuclear experts said they were watching japan to learn more about how the plant performed especially as countries around the world invest in a new generation of nuclear facilities "in the past their plants have withstood earthquakes really well " said adrian heymer senior director for new plant development at the nuclear energy institute in washington d c an industry organization in the u s as in japan deep earth borings are made before plants are sited to identify fault lines or other geologic threats facilities are engineered to withstand earthquakes even in zones not prone to them as a precautionary measure u s plants are built to withstand seismic threats according to estimates of what the peak ground acceleration might be in coming years any plants built in the eastern part of the u s will be required to meet a higher seismic standard than in the past as part of the licensing process with the nuclear regulatory commission plants proposed for western states probably will have to meet a still higher standard since the west is more prone to earthquakes japan introduced new guidelines last year to strengthen nuclear power plants ability to withstand earthquakes but those rules are being phased in gradually no timetable is set for reopening the plant prolonged closure will hurt tokyo electric particularly during the heat of summer when energy demands soar the megawatt kashiwazaki plant accounts for of tokyo electrics total capacity the company supplies electricity to million households in and around tokyo before the plant was built tokyo electric was aware of an active fault line that ran under the sea nearby but the companys study showed the line didnt extend under the site itself government officials said that analysis following mondays quake showed the fault line at kashiwazaki one of hundreds that crisscross japan may be longer than was earlier believed toyota said it would cease production at all domestic plants after mondays earthquake damaged the main production facilities of riken corp an engine parts supplier toyota will stop production this afternoon and reassess tomorrow whether the plants can resume production monday the plants had a supply of parts that kept them running during the first days after the quake monday toyota produces at least cars a day in japan and exports as many as of them a spokesman declined to comment on how the shutdown might affect earnings other car makers also said their production was affected mitsubishi motors corp will suspend production for at least three days at three major assembly plants suzuki motor corp said it will see a production loss of about cars and motorcycles because of a temporary shutdown at five domestic plants fuji heavy industries ltd which makes the subaru brand of vehicles will stop production at five plants honda motor co said some of its car and motorcycle production facilities also could be stopped next week nissan motor co said it is monitoring the situation adding that it depends on riken for parts the widespread impact highlights auto companies reliance on a common parts maker for a crucial part of their product riken is japans biggest maker of piston rings for engines and of seal rings which prevent leaks in transmissions it provides parts for more than half the cars built in japan and about of cars world wide according to the company riken which had billion yen &# million of revenue for the year ended march has plants in and around kashiwazaki the city most severely stuck by the quake the company said there was no serious damage to its main factory but there was damage to its warehouses it is working with the auto makers to restore its facilities swiftly but noted that its gas and water supplies remain suspended riken hadnt determined how the damage would affect its earnings the company said stephen power contributed to this article
