student lending hits the web amid preferred lists scandal services sprout up to help borrowers shop for financing but they face scrutiny too amid controversy about how colleges steer borrowers toward certain lenders for student loans a slew of web based services have popped up in recent weeks to help people shop for college financing and already they too are drawing official scrutiny these new services with names like studentloanscout com and collegeloanmarket com arose partly in response to scandal surrounding colleges"preferred lender lists " which are names of suggested lenders that schools give to students to go to for loans a widely publicized investigation by new york attorney general andrew cuomo has found that some lenders provided perks such as stock or fancy meals to college financial aid officers in order to be featured on such lists but some of the new sites too are under investigation by mr cuomos office according to people familiar with the probes these people decline to say which companies are being scrutinized but they say concerns include lack of disclosure that the sites may have a financial interest in the recommendations they make the accuracy of the interest rates posted the impact on students credit scores and marketing practices in general the new web sites say they aim to help the borrowers who want to shop for loans on their own without relying just on input from the schools each works slightly differently but they all say they aim to help consumers compare interest rates and terms for private student loans the fastest growing segment of the student loan industry the sites dont charge borrowers but generally make money off fees that either lenders or schools pay more families have had to turn to private loans in recent years to finance college educations subsidized federal loan programs limit what students can borrow and increasingly that amount isnt enough to meet students needs as colleges raise costs far ahead of the inflation rate this past school year the average total tuition and fees at private colleges rose to &# more than the previous year add room and board and the cost climbs to &# private loan volume now totals &# billion that is more than three times the amount borrowed in after adjusting for inflation the upshot a college funding stream that was fairly exotic just a decade ago now amounts to about a quarter of the entire federal student loan volume however borrowers shopping for private student loans find it is almost impossible to accurately assess the cost up front since lenders try to conceal their interest rate formulas on the grounds that it is proprietary information often students have to actually apply for the loan to get a sense of what interest rate theyll have to pay among the sites to help borrowers compare loans new auction style models are emerging that aim to present real offers from lenders studentloanscout com the internet portal of san diego based college advance llc plans to officially launch next month consumers will share personal information including social security number mothers maiden name and the school they attend which goes to the lenders which also run a credit check then lenders would submit pricing offers through a password protected page that students can check over several days but this model poses a risk to borrowers because multiple lenders running credit checks could potentially lower a consumers credit score fair isaac corp which created the fico scoring system that creditors use to assess consumers risk says it can make accommodations for other types of loans notably car loans and home mortgages consumers shop around for those loans and fair isaac has been able to take that into account in its credit risk assessment formula but since shopping for a private student loan has been far less typical the company has no such accommodation for student loans says craig watts a spokesman for fair isaac he says the company will look at the phenomenon and consider adjusting the model "we think it will happen " says ulrika myggen chief executive of san diego based college advance until it does she says the site offers a disclosure note in the step just before students submit their application warning that lenders may request credit reports "and that these requests could negatively affect your credit score " she says she hasnt heard from mr cuomos office other companies say they have a way around the credit scoring issue college loan market llc says its site acts as a gatekeeper for consumers passing on information to the lenders such as the credit scores of the student and co signer while keeping the borrowers identity secret so that the credit scores are minimally affected ceo marc stein says five lenders but no schools yet have signed up for his service collegeloanmarket com which launched just last week he says he hasnt received an inquiry from mr cuomos office adding that he believes his product is in the "consumers best interest " in general the lenders that are listed agree to pay the sites a referral fee in exchange for business meaning that consumers may never learn of lower cost competitors that dont pay and at least one is owned by one of the lenders it lists estudentloan com which is owned by lender goal financial llc says lenders agree to pay fees in exchange for being listed on the site a recent search on estudentloan com for a &# private loan yielded two results one pitched a loan with an interest rate ranging from to from campus door inc a unit of lehman brothers inc another offered loans at interest rates between and from goal financial estudentloan doesnt disclose anywhere on the site that it gets referral fees shawn lindstrom director of e commerce for goal financial and a co founder of the web site says he thinks it should be "pretty obvious" to consumers mr lindstrom says he hasnt heard from mr cuomos office another company simpletuition inc also features paying lenders on its site simpletuition com lists a total of lenders some "partner" lenders such as key bank and bank of america pay a referral fee to simpletuition each time consumers click to them or ultimately choose them to drive shoppers to those banks the site gives them favorable placement atop a borrowers search results in april the company decided to also include nonpartner lenders in the mix including chase and u s bank to broaden the results those companies are listed in smaller typeface and dont include links to their web sites simpletuition com states on the site that it "may receive" a referral fee when a student selects one of its partner lenders the site doesnt provide specific rates offered by lenders but rather says the rate would be "as low as" a certain amount if you click through links to seek more detail on the lender you can get the "up to" figure kevin walker chief executive of simpletuition says the service doesnt purport to be a comprehensive search of loan options "internally we say we want to be part of a nutritious breakfast " he says he adds that he doesnt believe his company is being investigated "using our site doesnt impact the credit rating " he says borrower beware things to consider when shopping for student loans online multiple credit checks by potential lenders could affect your credit score some lenders pay a referral fee to the site when they win business some sites list a range of interest rates that wont necessarily reflect what youll actually pay the site may itself be owned by a lender
