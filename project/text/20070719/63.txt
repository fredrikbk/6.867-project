mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q you recently wrote that iphone owners using the device overseas must roam on at&amp t at high rates because the iphone wont work with sim cards from foreign carriers you noted that at&amp t has a monthly plan that cuts these per call voice rates somewhat but what are the options for using an iphone overseas for data purposes such as email and internet browsing a until apple initiates iphone service with foreign carriers which is expected to be a gradual process that will begin in europe iphone owners traveling abroad will be forced to roam on at&amp t and to pay through the nose for data as well as voice calls made over cellular phone networks they wont be able to buy cheaper service from a local foreign carrier and enable it by simply replacing the phones at&amp t sim card with the local carriers in addition it is important to note that even if you are willing to swallow these huge voice and data rates you must call at&amp t formerly cingular before you leave the u s with your iphone or any at&amp t phone to modify or "provision " your calling plan so it will even work overseas here are the details note that these prices and plans apply to many other phones at&amp t sells not just the iphone to recap the voice calling situation at&amp t charges very high fees which can be mitigated a bit by adding a special &# monthly add on feature called at&amp t world traveler to their plans this voice feature allows you to roam in countries and gives you discounts on calls from countries for instance in france italy germany and britain you pay a still high cents a minute compared with an even worse &# without the plan in hong kong or israel you pay a whopping &# a minute instead of an even more outrageous &# or &# respectively a minute for email and the web the best bet for iphone owners is to avoid using cellular networks and employ the phones wi fi capability which can cost nothing extra try to find a free or reasonably priced wi fi hot spot in which to check email and do web browsing you may even be able to make cheap voice calls this way using internet based calling services like jajah mobile jajah com which in my domestic tests worked properly via the iphones web browser however if you need to check email constantly or frequently you are unlikely to be able to depend solely on the wi fi method you can rely on at&amp t roaming to do this over foreign cellular services but as with the voice call situation it will cost a fortune at&amp t offers an add on plan for &# a month called the "pda smartphone iphone international data plan " this is on top of the &# a month voice plan and is also additive to the &# a month for unlimited data when in the u s that is built into your base plan but it isnt unlimited you get only megabytes of overseas data use a month and pay a stiff &# a kilobyte for all data use above that plus this international data plan only works in countries outside those countries the cost is an astounding &# a kilobyte or roughly &# a megabyte to put that in perspective a single email with a medium resolution picture attached could amount to a megabyte more information is at www att com wirelessinternational one more note apparently at&amp t can and will cancel your roaming service overseas if it notices what it considers an unusually high number of calls being made one reader with an iphone reported that after arranging belatedly in europe to get the voice roaming service he was suddenly cut off when he reached india with at&amp t explaining the cutoff as an attempt to prevent suspected fraud according to this reader at&amp t said he had been cut off "because there were too many calls from india and other countries and they did not think it was possible anyone could be doing that for real so to protect me they cancelled the service " an at&amp t spokesman says the company cant comment on the details of this particular case without knowing the travelers phone number q you say office runs ok on windows vista i have been using office and it does everything i need will it also run ok on vista a microsoft doesnt officially support office on vista it may work but i havent tested it q is there a way that i can use my same email address both at my home in new jersey and at my winter place in florida even though i have broadband internet service in new jersey but am limited to dial up internet access from a different provider in florida a some broadband providers also make available a supplementary dial up service for their customers which may be free or cost extra check with your broadband service to see if it offers this option if not you could simply use an email account that isnt necessarily tied to an access provider at all such as web based email services from yahoo google or microsoft you could switch to one of these permanently and use it in both locations or you can forward your main email address to one of them while you are in florida people who send you email wouldnt have to learn a new address and many web based services allow you to set your main address as the "reply to" address for emails you send you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online free of charge at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
