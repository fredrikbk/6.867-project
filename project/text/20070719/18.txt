dance to the slowing of time new york late night strollers on the plaza of lincoln center this month will find the porch of the new york state theater regular home to both new york city ballet and new york city opera hung with three gauzy screens feet high from about p m to a m each night through july the white expanses will hold projected gently moving images of individual dancers think a gigantic altarpiece triptych or broadway billboards or the pediment decoration on the parthenon or all three at once captured by an all seeing lens the creation of david michalek a one time still camera portrait photographer who now prefers to call himself a "portrait artist " the presentation is called "slow dancing " it could just have easily been called "slow dancers " as its images evolve through their approximately minute durations mr michaleks method involved shooting five second etudes created by his dancing subjects with a frame per second high definition high speed camera thus stretching five seconds of performing into seconds of reproduced activity mr michalek who is years old and has other theatrical collaborations to his credit including two with avant garde director peter sellars maintains an abiding interest in dance he is married to wendy whelan a new york city ballet principal dancer his "slow dancing" subjects including ms whelan come from an array of dance backgrounds from the formal theatrical and traditional to the social ritual and recreational their ages range from to computer programming will randomly determine the sequence of projections each night so one four hour display will not necessarily duplicate any other from night to night because of the variety of dance forms included its unlikely that any single viewer however familiar with dance nowadays will recognize all the performers to take the projects full measure it might be ideal to have no preconceptions whatsoever of the dancers on view and to take at face value what mr michaleks camera shows of them at this scale and at this pace more than half of these slowed up dancers are already fairly well known to me as i watch them materialize at the center of their screens in fact ive found them in the real time and space of contemporary dance theater to be a mixed lot to put it politely as far as true artistic stature goes in "slow dancing " however they become oddly eerily equal if andy warhol could suggest with some confidence that everybodys famous "for minutes " mr michaleks work proposes authoritatively that all dancers can be equally formidable for "slow" minutes in some cases dancers of extraordinary gifts such as american ballet theatres herman cornejo look intermittently less than their near perfect selves for all the visual impact imparted by the stark black background provided by the by foot filming space of mr michaleks studio mr cornejo dressed in skin tone trunks at times seems blatantly "off " when almost ferociously pointing his powerful bare feet as they stretch and spring him into the heavy air of determined flight the scrupulous dancer looks as if his feet sickle or curve inward in a way that any ballet teacher would frown upon elsewhere however the year old paris opera trained and now retired ballerina isabelle guerin in her ivory colored lingerie like shift beats the devil of slowness as the dark haired and dark eyed woman works through moves as pronounced as those of mr cornejo she manages to maintain the exquisite outward flow or "line" that remains central to ballet dancings clarity some of the improvisation like "studies" arranged by these dancers even rise above the realm of sheer visual splendor and muscular radiance and become something still more resonant nearly year old allegra kent one time muse of george balanchine is shown in a translucent floor length loose fitting dress with pointed slit sleeves all in whisper light sea green as she looks out with lightly piercing blue eyes she revolves with a mesmerizing impetus that flows through the length of her liquidly light arms and continues into her artfully opened fingers in the process ms kent uses her minute presentation to bring to mind the protective metamorphosis of daphne fleeing the advances of apollo by turning into a laurel tree even viewers unfamiliar with the performers names will find innumerable variations and distinctions from one dancer to another witty gabriel "kwikstep" dionisio a hip hop dancer and choreographer spends his minutes onscreen balancing and rotating on his head intense tattooed jeremy wade who describes himself as a "swimmer turned dancer choreographer " keeps his back to the camera the whole time never turning around inexplicably only one of the ballerinas is on pointe all the others are barelegged and barefoot the one exception is dana caspersen an unexceptional dancer who labors in ungainly looking pointe shoes and who is connected by marriage and profession to william forsythe and his german based dance company viewers who might like to have a way of identifying the dancers they see should know that there are two unassuming racks of programs under the overhang of the theaters porch giving the names photos and backgrounds of each of the participants on the screens mr michalek is taking his display on the road in september when its installed at los angeless music center the projects initial commissioner "slow dancing" will involve four screens surrounding a fountain i suspect that any number of dancers who arent now part of mr michaleks sampler will crave their minutes of large scale exposure and hope to become part of some future array even when the merciless eye of his camera captures imperfections it does so indelibly and manages to dramatize dance and dancing as no merely still image ever could mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
