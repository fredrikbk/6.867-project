our broken corporate tax code in president ronald reagan in tandem with the democratic house and republican senate reformed and simplified the tax code reducing the number of brackets closing loopholes and lowering individual and corporate rates the u s moved from a country with above average corporate tax rates to one with below average rates the reagan tax reforms set the stage for years of remarkable economic performance in the u s and around the world what ronald reagan called "the american miracle " twenty years later after much of the world has followed our lead the u s is once again a high corporate tax country we now have on average the second highest statutory corporate tax rate including state corporate taxes compared with an average rate of for our top competitors the democratic market oriented nations that form the organisation of economic cooperation and development oecd ireland for example has engineered its own economic miracle in large part due to a reform program that cut corporate tax rates to a level one third that of the u s and the trend continues germany will reduce its total rate from to in france japan and the united kingdom have signaled they may also lower their corporate rates china though not an oecd member has recently passed legislation that will unify domestic and foreign corporate taxes at rates substantially below the oecd average this trend raises a crucial question policymakers should be asking are these countries learning a lesson that we have forgotten the tax reform recognized that if there is a prescriptive role for business tax policy it is to free companies to put capital to its best use which is essential to grow and sustain higher standards of living for u s workers instead of building on the proven success of these reforms we have moved in the opposite direction making the code more complex adding narrow provisions that create or respond to current headlines what reagan referred to in as the "old jalopy of our tax system" is clogging the u s economic highway yet again next thursday i will host a conference that will begin a new broad examination of our business tax system and its impact on economic growth and job creation in the u s with the job growth and tax relief act president bush and congress reduced the double taxation of dividends and gave small businesses incentives to grow and hire the act spurred capital creation that combined with a robust global economy and contributed to the creation of eight million new jobs and low unemployment rate economic growth has boosted real wages over the past year the average production worker has seen his annual wages rise &# above inflation tax systems have one fundamental purpose to raise revenue and the best systems minimize the drag on the economy therefore we should ask for a given level of revenue what business tax regime best promotes u s economic growth and creates jobs at a time when markets change rapidly requiring businesses to be ever more flexible and swift they are burdened with a business tax code complicated by parochial political interests government should not pick economic winners or losers the marketplace has proven itself more than able for that task business tax policy levers such as the corporate tax rate depreciation rates and investor taxes as well as the taxes levied on small businesses through the individual income tax should strive towards a similar purpose to encourage economic growth by reducing the tax burden on additional investments yet the current tax code distorts capital flows hurting productivity job creation and our global competitiveness take just a few examples taxes on capital income raise the price of future consumption and discourage saving and capital formation reduced capital formation gives labor less capital to work with and lowers labor productivity reducing real wages and income targeted provisions to encourage specific activity substantially narrow the tax base and thus overall tax rates must be higher and these provisions add complexity some have estimated that businesses spend &# billion annually on tax compliance costs &# billion that could create jobs provide greater employee benefits and generate economic growth even the opportunity for favorable tax treatment gives rise to corporate expenditures on lobbying rather than on growth creation the current tax depreciation system does not treat investments uniformly depreciation allowances vary without clear economic rationale this can bias decision making and result in a direct misallocation of capital if firms make marginal investment choices based on taxation rather than innovation the double taxation of corporate profits distorts a number of economic decisions important to a healthy economy the double tax combined with the interest tax deduction favors debt over equity financing it may also discourage earnings distributions through dividends or share repurchases confounding market signals of a companys financial health the double tax in effect penalizes investment in the corporate form this also may lead to misallocation of capital by influencing investment among firms in the economy over the past two decades while u s tax law has grown more complicated and our statutory corporate income tax rate has increased other nations have been reducing their rates to replicate our miracle a study by treasury economists estimated that a country with a tax rate one percentage point lower than another countrys attracts more capital its not surprising then that average oecd corporate tax rates have trended steadily downward maintaining our competitiveness in todays global environment requires us to think comprehensively and act prudently as europes biggest economies and developing nations around the world move to reduce corporate taxes and gain the benefits for their workers that u s workers already enjoy now is an opportune time when our economy is in a position of strength to consider ways our business tax system can be improved mr paulson is the secretary of the treasury
