world here " he said recently wearing a heavy winter jacket inside the refrigerated dubai flower exchange outside the temperature was degrees the new flower business of aramex a freight and express delivery company is a small part of a big change in the middle east dismissed not long ago as an economic wasteland the region has arrived as a force in the global economy for the first time in the modern middle east investment is pouring across national borders delivering capital from places that have it like the oil rich emirate of abu dhabi to countries like egypt and morocco that need it private equity firms are proliferating raising billions of dollars designated for the region fueled by rising oil revenues middle eastern and north african economies grew more than in each of the past three years according to a joint study by the organization for economic cooperation and development and countries in the region thats slower than chinas annual pace but it easily tops the middle easts average of between and and surpasses the growth rate of most developed nations middle eastern economies also boomed in the late s and s when oil prices were high but much is different this time back then oil rich governments poured billions of dollars into white elephant projects while individuals went on shopping binges in western fashion capitals now private investors are taking the lead and directing their capital to developing industries such as petrochemicals which makes chemical products derived from petroleum that industry is rapidly migrating to the middle east where oil is cheaper and more easily accessible meanwhile middle eastern investors have turned into important global financial players buying everything from manhattan hotels to prime waterfront real estate in cape town south africa wall street bankers including morgan stanley goldman sachs group inc and citigroup inc are expanding operations in the mideast as much as one third of the money devoted to project finance is now going to middle east projects according to analysts at hsbc economic development alone wont resolve the regions political problems such as the israeli palestinian conflict or iraqs bloody sectarian rivalries however improved prospects could help prevent clashes from spreading and avert new ones from cropping up the real test of the middle easts unprecedented investment boom will be whether it creates jobs and with them the sort of budding middle class that is driving the dynamism of china and india the middle east is an ocean of youth about half of the total population of million is below the age of many countries already have double digit unemployment rates employing this generation will require million to million new jobs by according to the oecd regional study the regions economies will need to grow even faster at least to a year the study says to keep unemployment from rising further politics is a constant threat to development government sales of huge companies which employ millions of middle easterners have sometimes been tainted with favoritism and outright corruption while the sales have helped lay the foundations for faster growth most of the beneficiaries so far have been a small group of elites who are getting wealthy while the endemic poverty in the more populous countries continues unabated egypt and saudi arabia have tricky transitions ahead as their aging leaders pass from the scene still countries like egypt jordan morocco and even libya and syria are competing for foreign investment a sea change from old protectionist habits theyre led by a new generation of ministers tapped from the private sector saudi arabia has joined the world trade organization abu dhabi is reaching out to the world building middle east branches of both the guggenheim and louvre museums dubai once a sleepy persian gulf trading post has become a sprawling metropolis of skyscrapers and deal makers it has set a precedent as an economy

new economic integration as a research fellow at princeton universitys princeton environmental institute corporate cross border investments from telecommunications to real estate have skyrocketed in

investors are starting to get in on the action too david rubenstein head of carlyle group lp a leading u s private equity firm recently told a group of investors in dubai that the middle east is emerging as one of the global hot spots for private equity deals where investors purchase stakes in companies and try to improve their performance before selling them at a profit in egypt and morocco

also benefited from special economic zones set up in jordan and egypt the only two arab countries with diplomatic relations with israel the u s gives favorable trade treatment to goods made there provided they use a certain percentage of israeli suppliers the roots of the regions economic awakening go back to the oil bust of the s when prices dipped below &# a barrel humbled oil producers began to get serious about reducing their almost total dependence on oil revenues the aftermath of the terrorist attacks spurred the process on many middle easterners turned to investing within the region in part for protection from what they saw as a hostile climate in the u s and europe among them was arif naqvi a pakistani who had worked at both a western multinational american express co and one of saudi arabias biggest family owned conglomerates the olayan group he started as olayans head of global business development when he was years old in the s mr naqvi started an investment company

significant investments it fit a strategy hes honed since and many others have taken up raise capital largely in the oil rich persian gulf and sink it into local companies he picks companies aiming to expand first in the region then globally mr naqvi doesnt think businesses or investors should be deterred by the war in iraq the festering conflict between israelis and palestinians or the deteriorating political situation in lebanon these can be worked around he says instead he sees some intriguing developments he feels are knitting the middle east together and weaving it into the global economy the regions stock and debt markets have been expanding and spreading money across national borders thats partly thanks to innovations in islamic finance which many muslims find appealing because it conforms to religious restrictions on charging interest the arrival of arab language satellite television networks offers a new way for middle eastern companies like aramex to build strong regional brands and then try to take them global egypt jordan and morocco have appointed former executives of multinational companies into key ministerial positions where they are working to reduce tariffs and trade barriers "i like to think of it as the empowerment of the arab businessman " said mr naqvi aramex a family run company established in was among the first arab companies to list on the u s nasdaq exchange in raising money on a middle east exchange was a near impossibility back then because of red tape and restrictions on foreign ownership by aramex stock was floundering
