the daily fix cubs and yankees are showing that theyre not dead just yet online edition two left for dead baseball teams are tearing up their obits in the national league central the chicago cubs are on a roll since june and now stand in second place just games behind the milwaukee brewers and three games out of the wild card lead in the new york times lee jenkins traces the cubs winning to losing tempers in early june pitcher carlos zambranos fisticuffs with since exiled catcher michael barrett manager lou piniellas piniellaesque tirade at umpire mark wegner and ejections earned by pitcher ted lilly and first baseman derrek lee for hostile acts "generally speaking when a team is fighting with opponents umpires and each other it is a sure sign that things are falling apart " mr jenkins writes "but for the cubs it was a sign that things were finally coming together when cubs players are asked to identify a single turning point for this season the answers vary but they unfailingly cite one tantrum or another " in the american league east meanwhile the new york yankees appear to have righted their ship even as the s s boston red sox is taking on water on july th the yankees were games out now theyre seven back and six out in the wild card race "hand on their hearts the yankees promise theyre not obsessing over the red sox just yet nor are they re calculating the once dreary math that insisted the race in the al east was over " writes bob klapisch in the bergen record "the bombers are playing it cool whittling down bostons lead on a slow but steady basis letting everyone else whisper about the ghosts of " red sox nation all of a sudden isnt playing it so cool "we all hear the footsteps " tony massarotti writes in the boston herald "the yankees are coming the yankees are coming the yankees are coming suddenly it feels like the red sox are the team doing the chasing the simple truth today is that sox now have just a six game lead in the loss column and six games remaining to be played with the yankees and we do not need a slide rule to recognize that the latter can negate the former " "friends dont leave friends behind if they can help it " writes tom gage in the detroit news "going out cmon along headed to the ballgame jump in the car or as happened last week with the tigers and the all star game grab your glove pack your bag youre going magglio ordonez made sure someone who wasnt originally going because hes not a tigers coach someone who wasnt going because there was another who could have been his pitcher in the home run derby someone who might never have gotten the chance to be in uniform and enjoy the experience of an all star game went " that someone was tigers bullpen catcher scott pickens whose story mr gage tells nicely even nicer though is the simple explanation mr ordonez gave mr pickens for his ticket to san francisco "youre my friend you go " the atlanta journal constitutions furman bisher has an open letter for arthur blank the owner and ceo of the atlanta falcons and employer of michael vick indicted for charges of sponsoring a dogfighting operation "no owner of a professional team franchise could have been kinder than you have been to michael vick " mr bisher writes "you have coddled him you have taken him in as a friend and team owners cant have friendships with players it doesnt work " all hail barry bonds thats how sam donnellon of the philadelphia daily news begins his latest column and hes serious "now that i have your attention heres why a lot of good has come about during his charge toward baseballs all time home run record " mr donnellon writes mr donnellon says bondsmania has decreased interest in the home run in favor of defense and fundamentals and rekindled interest in the legendary careers of hank aaron babe ruth and willie mays "so all hail barry " he writes "every surly and likely altered ounce of him for those who say baseball makes strange bedfellows well there goes your proof " dontrelle willis the high kicking ace of the florida marlins isnt exactly having a face card year mr willis began the year with a record but hasnt won since may his record stands at a mediocre mark for a mediocre team "the sound the vibe in the place is what tells you how much things have changed for dontrelle willis " writes greg cote in the miami herald "there was palpable electricity once when he pitched at home a discernible buzz and energy in the crowd something special was happening on the mound and you knew it you could hear it in the stands now there is apprehension in the quiet under the surface booing waits like water close to a boil there isnt a lot of it but you hear it willis runs off the mound after his latest outing and that sound chases him a few boos more sympathetic applause but mostly a void where excitement used to be its the sound of a fandom not ready to give up on its former darling but headed there its the sound of patience running out " every year the nba showcases prospects veterans and hopefuls in its summer leagues oddball outfits likely to elicit blank looks from all but hardcore basketball fans but perhaps the summer leagues are ready for their closeups in slate david roth calls the league "an entity with no real analogue in american pro sports its worthless to watch summer league basketball in hopes of seeing how good someone like kevin durant is going to be in the pros if youd like to see how good durant would be if he played in a freakishly competitive game at the y however youve come to the right place " summer league games mr roth says "are exceptionally entertaining a hyper speed assemblage of fast breaks and often dazzling one on one offense interspersed with the odd blocked shot pointer or errant pass that lack of structure leads to sloppiness most games in the vegas summer league averaged about a turnover a minute but it also lends these barely coached contests an endearingly casual quality if youll forgive me for pointing out the obvious nba players even marginal nba players are very good at basketball watching them play pickup ball in which defense is secondary and creativity is king is thrilling " thrilling but not necessarily revelatory for the nba clubs using the leagues to evaluate talent mr roth notes former florida stater von wafer put up shots in minutes calling that "a chuck tacular stat line that might have resulted in the only point game ever to decrease a players chances of making a team " or take this years vegas league mvp the knicks nate robinson knicks fans know mr robinson as an inefficient ball hog and theyre not wrong "in the frenetic summer league though his worst tendencies the inability to slow down or pass up a shot ever a predilection for jumping before deciding whether to pass or shoot become crowd pleasing stat stuffing pluses " mr roth writes "for the same reasons that robinson annoys knicks fans hed be a lot of fun as a pickup teammate he is the ultimate summer league player " on espn com bill simmons looks at the vegas league a combination that seems tailor made for the sports guy his verdict "if youre one of the few remaining nba
