understated khakis and white polo kind of preppy this is a time of loud pink and lime for men the new preppy is much like the style chronicled in s "the official preppy handbook " but with some new twists lilly pulitzer whose flowered palm beach shift dresses became famous in the s now has a collection for men and has broadened her offerings for women and children as well ralph lauren has renewed its famous polo shirts by enlarging the pony giving its wasp y standard an ironic wink there are new angles like pants in horizontal seersucker and corduroy from cordarounds com vineyard vines

very american the silk ties populated by tiny whales sailboats or flags are a favorite among politicians arnold schwarzenegger and bill clinton are among the adherents the last time we were loving golf shirts and pearls this way we were entering an era that celebrated wealth on our way to a time when gordon gekko was the king of wall street and every aspiring corporate raider had a closet full of lacoste alligator shirts and topsider deck shoes then greed was good now we call it "luxury " this is a period that lusts for symbols of the good life &# crocodile handbags &# tourbillon watches &# bottles of olive oil and big charitable donations that assuage the guilt of driving an suv the preppy look is the affordable weekend version of all that its what the people who run the nation have always worn at their country homes now as in the s people who want to suggest they live that lifestyle are wearing it too never mind that preppies were traditionally old money understated now the look is about flamboyant colors and embroidered whales over drinks a few days ago at power burger restaurant j g melons in manhattan i noted three pairs of madras shorts two loud lacoste shirts a nantucket reds t shirt and one vineyard vines canvas tote not to mention mayor michael bloomberg who was dining there though casual in slacks and a button down that evening mr bloomberg has been photographed in a vineyard vines tie for much of the past two decades preppy wasnt politically correct those who were born to it toned it down khakis and a bland polo it certainly wasnt mainstream in the loud embroidered lobster versions that are appearing today it turned out that gordon gekko the iconic character in the movie "wall street " represented the end of an era he was headed to jail at the end of the movie which came out a few months before the black monday crash heralded a new zeitgeist soon avarice was sin again and political correctness was at cross purposes with preppy wasp dom anyone parading around with their polo collar turned up in looked chuckleheaded remember the preppy evil girlfriend in s "legally blonde" then times changed again today rather than corporate raiders we have private equity hedge funds and all manner of derivatives trading "things got so multicultural around here that preppy waned " says john murray co owner of murrays toggery shop in nantucket which invented the prepster staple nantucket red canvas pants and holds a copyright on them "but now its back " of course todays preppy look has some new elements like more dress styles more florals even as some people take pages straight from the s like layering two polos others are mixing and matching preppy with other looks indian skirts &# jeans many people today want to be more worldly than the s with organics and "red" campaign causes and they dont want to look like theyve never spent a summer away from nantucket so they pair those madras shorts with cowboy boots wearing the "whole look" is so heart on sleeve aspirational that even the co founder of vineyard vines shep murray calls it "a little extreme " hip hoppers have put their own spin on the look the popular hip hop group t pain wore madras shorts bow ties and pink oxford shirts for their recent appearance on the bet awards but the bottom line is the same a reference to wealth and power to promote its raw tea drink smirnoff

white group calling itself "prep unit" in the smirnoff video wearing pink golf shirts and seersucker "by real we mean rich from new hampshire to vermont from the main line to greenwich " the videos director veteran rap video director julien "little x" lutz says hip hop culture has a sister in wasp style "hip hop is rapping about money and power and women which is perfect for preps " mr lutz says a book called "a privileged life celebrating wasp style " was just published by assouline publishing susanna salk the books author says she had trouble getting people to participate in the book because many people feared the term wasp would generate controversy it was thought to suggest narrow mindedness or white monoculture but the book hasnt been controversial "preppy fashion is so iconic now " ms salk says "theres a nostalgia element to it its certainly a privilege to live in a manner that doesnt evolve doesnt change " the new prepsters here are some of the new looks todays preppies
