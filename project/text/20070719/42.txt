hidden facts hidden agendas nation of secrets by ted gup doubleday pages &# our country is in peril and the danger is not coming at us principally from foreign forces but from within or at least that is what ted gup argues in "nation of secrets " according to mr gup a former investigative reporter at time magazine and the washington post our open society is turning into a closed one a wave of secrecy "threatens to engulf our democratic institutions and irrevocably alter the landscape of america " mr gup assembles a massive dossier in support of this sweeping claim surveying our national security establishment in the wake of he finds that it generates a whopping secrets a day or as he does the math " every hour of the day and night " elsewhere college administrators eager to protect their schools image conceal "financial mismanagement bloated executive salaries recruiting violations and plagiarism " in the courts judges allow lawyers to settle product liability lawsuits with confidentiality agreements that deprive consumers of life saving information even the press the putative protector of openness is prone to a harmful form of secrecy journalists rely on anonymous sources to gather news but the "mask of anonymity is not always donned for high principles alone " unnamed sources mr gup notes pursue hidden agendas and reporters use such sources to pursue hidden agendas of their own but it is in the realm of foreign policy and intelligence where the effects of secrecy are most corrosive mr gup argues producing "errors in judgment and a tendency toward paranoia" and even worse a government that "may dare to orchestrate and choreograph the news " here he cites "one of the most celebrated triumphs of the war on terror" the capture of abu zubaydah in pakistan in march the bush administration portrayed this event as "a body blow to osama bin laden " but in fact mr gup says it was something different the investigative reporter ron suskind he claims "peeled back the cover of secrecy" and discovered that zubaydah was "mentally incompetent and utterly incapable of playing any significant role in al qaeda " really that characterization does not jibe with other accounts including those of insiders in a better position to know like former cia director george tenet who tells us in his memoirs that abu zubaydah was an al qaeda linchpin his capture mr tenet wrote "provided a motherlode of information" that led directly to the capture of other terrorist plotters including some of the planners of isnt it just possible to borrow from mr gups own analysis that reporters and book authors have their own veiled agendas which may lead them at times to be less than a purely "objective" source of information and judgment mr gup has unquestionably done a thorough job of cataloging many instances in which secrecy has been abused some of them disturbing some of them piquant the letters that clare boothe luce wrote when she was u s ambassador to italy in are still classified "top secret " yet "nation of secrets" fails to answer the most critical question that it implicitly raises what should legitimately be kept secret and what should not mr gup never acknowledges that in a complex modern society secrecy is a necessary fact of life essential to some degree to the proper functioning of all sorts of institutions in the government and in the private sphere there are imperatives like privacy that compete with openness which is why courts and university administrators do not disclose to the public everything they know there is also the readily comprehensive imperative of national defense can anyone really object to the fact that our government in the aftermath of rushed to withdraw from circulation blueprints of nuclear power stations chemical depots and other potential targets if some nonsecrets were swept up in the haste is that really a national disaster we might prefer to have secrets generated "every hour of the day and night " or an even greater number if that would diminish the chance of something sensitive getting into the wrong hands what is more " secrets" is a statistical artifact when a given classified document is emailed to say authorized recipients the result is tallied by the government as new secrets mr gup might have acknowledged this replicating distortion at once he does not do so until later misleading readers but exaggeration is part of a pattern in "nation of secrets " mr gup says that he is "sounding the tocsin" about our "nations precipitous slide into compulsive secrecy " perhaps but he is also using overheated rhetoric to spread a kind of hysteria yes excessive secrecy can cause "errors in judgment and a tendency toward paranoia " but excessive anxiety about secrecy which is what "nation of secrets" attempts to stir can cause errors in judgment too tending toward a paranoia about government itself and laying us bare to the perils that flow from revealing too many secrets in a
