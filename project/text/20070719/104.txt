the impoverishment of american culture there is an experiment id love to conduct id like to survey a cross section of americans and ask them how many active nba players major league baseball players and "american idol" finalists they can name then id ask them how many living american poets playwrights painters sculptors architects classical musicians conductors and composers they can name id even like to ask how many living american scientists or social thinkers they can name fifty years ago i suspect that along with mickey mantle willie mays and sandy koufax most americans could have named at the very least robert frost carl sandburg arthur miller thornton wilder georgia okeeffe leonard bernstein leontyne price and frank lloyd wright not to mention scientists and thinkers like linus pauling jonas salk rachel carson margaret mead and especially dr alfred kinsey i dont think that americans were smarter then but american culture was even the mass media placed a greater emphasis on presenting a broad range of human achievement i grew up mostly among immigrants many of whom never learned to speak english but at night watching tv variety programs like the ed sullivan show i saw along with comedians popular singers and movie stars classical musicians like jascha heifetz and arthur rubinstein opera singers like robert merrill and anna moffo and jazz greats like duke ellington and louis armstrong captivate an audience of millions with their art the same was true of literature i first encountered robert frost john steinbeck lillian hellman and james baldwin on general interest tv shows all of these people were famous to the average american because the culture considered them important today no working class kid would encounter that range of arts and ideas in the popular culture almost everything in our national culture even the news has been reduced to entertainment or altogether eliminated the loss of recognition for artists thinkers and scientists has impoverished our culture in innumerable ways but let me mention one when virtually all of a cultures celebrated figures are in sports or entertainment how few possible role models we offer the young there are so many other ways to lead a successful and meaningful life that are not denominated by money or fame adult life begins in a childs imagination and weve relinquished that imagination to the marketplace i have a reccurring nightmare i am in rome visiting the sistine chapel i look up at michelangelos incomparable fresco of the "creation of man " i see god stretching out his arm to touch the reclining adams finger and then i notice in the other hand adam is holding a diet pepsi when was the last time you have seen a featured guest on david letterman or jay leno who isnt trying to sell you something a new movie a new tv show a new book or a new vote dont get me wrong i have a stanford mba and spent years in the food industry i adore my big screen tv the productivity and efficiency of the free market is beyond dispute it has created a society of unprecedented prosperity but we must remember that the marketplace does only one thing it puts a price on everything the role of culture however must go beyond economics it is not focused on the price of things but on their value and above all culture should tell us what is beyond price including what does not belong in the marketplace a culture should also provide some cogent view of the good life beyond mass accumulation in this respect our culture is failing us there is only one social force in america potentially large and strong enough to counterbalance this commercialization of cultural values our educational system traditionally education has been one thing that our nation has agreed cannot be left entirely to the marketplace but made mandatory and freely available to everyone at i am just old enough to remember a time when every public high school in this country had a music program with choir and band usually a jazz band too sometimes even an orchestra and every high school offered a drama program sometimes with dance instruction and there were writing opportunities in the school paper and literary magazine as well as studio art training i am sorry to say that these programs are no longer widely available this once visionary and democratic system has been almost entirely dismantled by well meaning but myopic school boards county commissioners and state officials with the federal government largely indifferent to the issue art became an expendable luxury and million students have paid the price today a childs access to arts education is largely a function of his or her parents income in a time of social progress and economic prosperity why have we experienced this colossal cultural decline there are several reasons but i must risk offending many friends and colleagues by saying that surely artists and intellectuals are partly to blame most american artists intellectuals and academics have lost their ability to converse with the rest of society we have become wonderfully expert in talking to one another but we have become almost invisible and inaudible in the general culture this mutual estrangement has had enormous cultural social and political consequences america needs its artists and intellectuals and they need to re establish their rightful place in the general culture if we could reopen the conversation between our best minds and the broader public the results would not only transform society but also artistic and intellectual life there is no better place to start this rapprochement than in arts education how do we explain to the larger society the benefits of this civic investment when they have been convinced that the purpose of arts education is to produce more artists which is hardly a compelling argument to the average taxpayer we need to create a new national consensus the purpose of arts education is not to produce more artists though that is a byproduct the real purpose of arts education is to create complete human beings capable of leading successful and productive lives in a free society this is not happening now in american schools what are we to make of a public education system whose highest goal seems to be producing minimally competent entry level workers the situation is a cultural and educational disaster but it also has huge and alarming economic consequences if the u s is to compete effectively with the rest of the world in the new global marketplace it is not going to succeed through cheap labor or cheap raw materials nor even the free flow of capital or a streamlined industrial base to compete successfully this country needs creativity ingenuity and innovation it is hard to see those qualities thriving in a nation whose educational system ranks at the bottom of the developed world and has mostly eliminated the arts from the curriculum marcus aurelius believed that the course of wisdom consisted of learning to trade easy pleasures for more complex and challenging ones i worry about a culture that trades off the challenging pleasures of art for the easy comforts of entertainment and that is exactly what is happening not just in the media but in our schools and civic life entertainment promises us a predictable pleasure humor thrills emotional titillation or even the odd delight of being vicariously terrified it exploits and manipulates who we are rather than challenging us with a vision of who we might become a child who spends a month mastering halo or nba live on xbox has not been awakened and transformed the way that child would be spending the time rehearsing a play or learning to draw if you dont believe me you should read the studies that are now coming out about american civic participation our country is dividing into two distinct behavioral groups one group spends most of its free time sitting at home as passive consumers of electronic entertainment even family communication is breaking down as members increasingly spend their time alone staring at their individual screens the other group also uses and enjoys the new technology but these individuals balance it with a broader range of activities they go out to exercise play sports volunteer and do charity work at about three times the level of the first group by every measure they are vastly more active and socially engaged than the first group what is the defining difference between passive and active citizens curiously it isnt income geography or even education it depends on whether or not they read for pleasure and participate in the arts these cultural activities seem to awaken a heightened sense of individual awareness and social responsibility art is an irreplaceable way of understanding and expressing the world equal to but distinct from scientific and conceptual methods art addresses us in the fullness of our being simultaneously speaking to our intellect emotions intuition imagination memory and physical senses there are some truths about life that can be expressed only as stories or songs or images art delights instructs consoles it educates our emotions and it remembers as robert frost once said about poetry "it is a way of remembering that which it would impoverish us to forget " art awakens enlarges refines and restores our humanity mr gioia is the chairman of the national endowment for the arts this article is a condensed version of his june commencement address at stanford university
