irs probes tax goal of derivatives federal tax authorities are seeking data from two large u s financial firms to determine whether complex derivatives trades they engineered for hedge fund and other clients were designed primarily to avoid taxes people familiar with the matter say banking giant citigroup inc and wall street firm lehman brothers holdings inc have received information document requests or so called idrs from the internal revenue service relating to the use of derivatives by offshore investors including some big hedge funds to sidestep withholding taxes on u s stock dividends these people say many u s hedge funds have offshore hubs at issue are derivatives trades where securities firms buy stocks from offshore hedge fund clients and in return pay them the return of the stocks and any dividends they generate if a &# stock rises to &# and pays a dividend of cents the securities firm pays the hedge fund &# representing the appreciation and the dividend minus a small fee the trade could save the hedge fund from paying as much as in taxes on the dividend depending on the venue because the fund technically doesnt hold the stock the question for the irs are these trades executed for an economic purpose or solely to evade taxes the irs requests come as wall street braces for a broader inquiry into a practice that is common among some securities firms which for years have pitched clients on these transactions using names such as "yield enhancement " "dividend arbitrage" and "tax efficiency" trades at stake is more than &# billion in withholding taxes on u s stock dividends that are sidestepped by derivatives trades structured by a number of wall street firms accountants say "we understand the irs is viewing this as an industry matter and we are of course cooperating and answering any questions they have raised " a citigroup spokesman said spokesmen for lehman and the irs declined to comment the irs move comes as lawmakers are stepping up scrutiny of tax advantages enjoyed by big wealth generators from hedge funds to private equity firms to oil companies to arcane investment vehicles and the individuals who profit from them in june the senate finance committee moved to introduce a bill to tax financial services partnerships that are publicly traded at the same rate paid by corporations under current law private equity firms have been able to list their shares on public markets paying no taxes only partners rather than the entity are now taxed the senate proposal would give a five year reprieve from higher taxes to firms that already have filed to go public or have gone public such as blackstone group lp and fortress investment group llc separately lawmakers are also looking at raising taxes on "carried interest " the bulk of the compensation received by private equity fund managers house democrats have proposed a bill that would tax carried interest at ordinary income rates of as much as compared with the current capital gains rate of the focus on taxes comes as wall street in recent years has devised increasingly complex ways for sophisticated players such as hedge funds to make more money and pay less taxes this effort has become ever more important for securities firms because hedge funds have grown to be their most important clients paying out huge trading commissions each year in the cat and mouse game that has played out for decades between regulators and wall street securities firms securities firms typically have been several steps ahead now regulators are attempting to catch up in may the irs established a branch of six attorneys to examine new financial products across an array of industries the move came as lon smith the irss associate chief counsel for financial institutions and products conceded publicly that the agency was "falling farther and farther behind" as markets became more complex the irs request of citigroup and lehman comes amid new signs of explosive growth in derivatives the "notional" amount of derivatives the value of the transactions underlying assets held by federally insured u s banks reached a record &# trillion in this years first quarter a rise from a year ago partly because of a rise in credit derivatives the office of the comptroller of the currency said last month credit derivatives enable the buyer in return for a premium linked to corporate bond rates to obtain insurance in the event an underlying company defaults on its debt the irss inquiry touches on whether complex derivatives trades between securities firms and offshore investors including hedge funds are essentially securities lending transactions under rules put in place nearly a decade ago addressing securities lending transactions the irs held that substitute interest and dividend payments that are "u s source " meaning that the underlying interest or dividends are paid by u s corporations are considered interest and dividends for purposes of determining the withholding taxes that apply to foreign companies and individuals some financial firms have suggested that these rules could be potentially avoided by entering into synthetic transactions such as derivatives in an april email that carried the subject line "irs enforcement trend targeted at financial institutions " accounting firm kpmg llp alerted its internal associates to the irs inquiry and laid out the issues "the united states generally imposes u s withholding taxes on dividends paid by u s corporations to foreign taxpayers " the kpmg email said "in comparison the united states does not impose u s withholding tax on foreign source income paid to foreign persons " under the rules governing financial instruments such as equity swaps kpmg says net income paid to a foreign person is "generally treated as foreign source income and thus exempt from u s withholding tax " in the email kpmg said "accordingly foreign persons may attempt to minimize their exposure to u s withholding tax by selling their positions in u s equities prior to the ex dividend date and entering into a synthetic "long" position under a total return equity swap referencing these same u s equities " "the purpose of the memo was to alert our professionals to the irs enforcement trends and to describe the transactions that the irs was apparently focused on " says a kpmg spokeswoman "it was not meant as client advice " in any case some accountants and tax specialists say these transactions could be affected by another irs guideline known as notice issued a decade ago the guideline suggests that if a derivatives trade is substantially similar to a securities lending transaction the payments would be viewed as substitute interest and dividend payments and potentially would be subject to u s withholding taxes at the time the irs issued the notice the agency said it planned to propose new regulations to provide specific guidance on how such substitute dividend payments were to be treated it hasnt done so until new regulations were proposed the irs indicated that notice remained in effect
