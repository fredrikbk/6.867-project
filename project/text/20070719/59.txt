locked out note to medicaid patients the doctor wont see you as program cuts fees mds drop out hurdle for expansion of care benton harbor mich medicaid provides health care coverage for millions of americans but a growing number of doctors wont accept it in february jada garrett a year old sophomore developed what seemed at first a mild case of strep throat within a couple of weeks her joints ballooned many afternoons her swollen ankles hurt too much to walk to get to the bottom of her symptoms jada needed to see a rheumatologist but the local one listed in her medicaid plans network wouldnt see her in his office the wait to get into a clinic was more than three months by the time she found a rheumatologist in a nearby county to take her in mid april jadas debilitating pain had caused her to miss several weeks of school "you feel so helpless thinking somethings wrong with this child and i cant even get her into a doctor " says jadas mother nicole garrett who enrolled her three teenage daughters in medicaid after they lost private coverage "when we had real insurance we could call and come in at the drop of a hat " on paper jadas medicaid coverage is real insurance funded jointly by states and the federal government the safety net program is intended to provide comprehensive health care coverage for more than million americans too poor or disabled to afford it elsewhere like the majority of medicaid recipients in michigan jada receives her benefits through a private health maintenance organization contracted by medicaid to administer the program but when medicaid patients seek care they often find themselves locked out of the medical system in a report from the center for studying health system change a nonprofit research group based in washington nearly half of all doctors polled said they had stopped accepting or limited the number of new medicaid patients thats because many medicaid programs straining under surging costs are balancing their budgets by freezing or reducing payments to doctors that in turn is driving many doctors particularly specialists out of the program the dwindling number of doctors who accept medicaid is a large little discussed hurdle to some ambitious efforts to broaden health care coverage expanding medicaid eligibility or using the private medicaid hmos is a linchpin in universal coverage initiatives in massachusetts and other states as well as some presidential candidates platforms in california a key component of gov arnold schwarzeneggers universal coverage proposal calls for a controversial to surcharge on doctors and hospitals revenues the money would be used to pay for higher medicaid fees so that doctors will take in more enrollees about of family physicians in california participate in medicaid for a number of specialties such as orthopedic surgery the percentage is much lower according to the california healthcare foundation michigans governor jennifer granholm is also pushing a plan to extend coverage to more than of the states uninsured because physician groups have balked at taking more people at medicaid level reimbursements policy makers hope the new program will pay doctors rates similar to medicare about two thirds higher than medicaid but many people fear that will give doctors even less reason to accept people on medicaid in michigan the number of doctors who will see medicaid patients has fallen from in to in many of those doctors tightly cap how many theyll see or refuse to take on new medicaid patients at the same time enrollment in the program in michigan has risen more than to nearly million since paul reinhart the states medicaid director says he doesnt believe difficulties finding specialists is a pervasive issue but he acknowledges that patients can run into access problems "thats a problem that were working on and one that probably can only really be resolved with increased fees " he says to safeguard against access problems his agency requires the plans to have at least one primary care physician for every people in a given region the program also checks a few times a year whether the specialists listed in the plans networks are indeed available "at this point i have to pay money out of my own pocket to take care of that medicaid patient and its only going to get worse " says apparao mukkamala president of the michigan state medical society and a radiologist in flint mich there auto industry layoffs have helped push one in five people onto medicaid or into the ranks of the uninsured for every chest x ray dr mukkamala performs for instance medicaid pays him &# commercial insurers such as blue cross pay about &# and medicare pays &# but with technicians film and other equipment his costs are about &# per x ray he estimates medicaid patients he sees at hurley medical center in flint make up of his work there like many states michigan hires private medicaid hmos to administer benefits the state pays hmos a monthly fee for each patient the hmos then pay doctors usually amounts close to government set payments as in many states the managed care plans win medicaid contracts based partly on how robust their networks of doctors and hospitals are the hmos directories of network providers in michigan seem full but phone calls to listed specialists in some places find big holes the three hmos which operate in the county around benton harbor community choice great lakes health plan and health plan of michigan post on their web sites lists of local specialists participating in their network of the obstetrician gynecologists that community choice lists for berrien county four doctors said they were listed in error and another one no longer practices in the area one took only medicaid patients referred to her by doctors within her practice three others were only seeing new medicaid patients at a nearby clinic not in their offices and two more were taking patients at the same clinic many doctors on health plan of michigans list which includes many of the same names had similar restrictions great lakes web site noted that none of the six on its ob gyn list were accepting new patients all three hmos listed gastroenterologists another high demand specialist area only saw medicaid patients at an offsite clinic where appointment waits can be three to nine months the health plans say they encourage members and their referring doctors to call them if they have trouble getting an appointment with a specialist "we cant just rely on whats in the directory it would be our obligation to help any member " says pamela morris president of caresource management group which manages community choices health plan she adds that a wait of several months is "unacceptable " the company says that all of the doctors in its directory are indeed contracted with it it says sometimes staff at medical practices make mistakes about what plans they accept health plan of michigans chief operating officer shery cotton says that in some places it will pay doctors bonuses to encourage them to see ob gyn patients it also periodically checks in with primary doctors to see if their medicaid patients are being refused by specialists and it doesnt require plan members to use just network doctors but ms cotton acknowledges that low reimbursements from the state sometimes make raising participation a struggle "we literally get on the phone with doctors and beg will you see this patient " steve matthews a spokesman for americhoice the medicaid arm of unitedhealth group inc which owns great lakes health plan said that the plans customer service records dont show a doctor access problem in benton harbor he added that if a patient has difficulty the company will help set up an appointment "anywhere in the state regardless of whether theyre in the network " many primary care doctors however say they dont have the time or resources to call the plans for all of the patients for whom they have trouble finding referrals robert ward iii a neurologist in nearby st joseph says the only new medicaid patients his practice now sees are those who were admitted to the local hospital first occasionally he will see a patient referred by a doctor he knows but all three of the local medicaid hmos have dr ward listed as a network provider only great lakes health plans web site notes that he isnt accepting new patients dr ward says his office has pointed this out to the medicaid plans when he started his practice in the early s dr ward says he placed no limits and medicaid patients flocked to his practice medicaid patients soon ballooned to of his roster "it was a rookie mistake " says dr ward one of only two full time neurologists in the tri county area commercial health plans such as blue cross pay him between &# and &# for a typical neurological exam he receives about &# from the medicaid plans now of his patients are on medicaid southwestern medical clinic a multispecialty group sees some medicaid patients in its offices across the county because of its involvement in christian based medical mission work that group now accounts for some of the clinics patient mix yet the clinic limits many appointments to medicaid patients who live in the same or surrounding zip codes of its various branches "we dont want people driving past their community provider to come see us " says kenneth oneill southwesterns medical director "otherwise the model of everyone doing their fair share starts to fall apart " delays in getting treatment can have serious consequences jennifer kinchen enrolled in medicaid in late after hurricane katrina forced her to leave her home in louisiana and move near family in benton harbor since late last year she has suffered from tremors severe enough to cause her to drop her coffee mug or sometimes fall liver problems and high levels of ammonia in her blood her family doctor has searched and waited to get her an appointment with a neurologist or gastroenterologist in the meantime ms kinchen has gone to the emergency room a few times because of dehydration and blacking out in benton harbor more than patients lost access to counseling services after the main provider of medicaid mental health services riverwood center stopped accepting payments from medicaid hmos riverwood says the reimbursements it was receiving from the medicaid hmos for outpatient sessions didnt cover their costs payment delays and other administrative hassles compounded the crunch says riverwoods president allen edlefson the center lost &# in the year before it decided to quit its medicaid hmo contracts "it was a painful decision but we just couldnt make it work financially " he says the medicaid hmos helped slow costs by more tightly managing care such as reducing hospital admissions and assuring that recipients are at least assigned a primary care doctor the state estimates hmos have saved medicaid more than &# million annually in recent years nestled along lake michigans southeastern shore benton harbor has been hard hit by job losses manufacturers have steadily cut or relocated elsewhere good paying union jobs with health benefits about a quarter of the community of poor and predominantly black are unemployed as the citys middle class dwindled most doctors along with the hospital relocated in the late s and early s across the st joseph river to its much more affluent twin st joseph a picturesque lake resort town most of those doctors are listed in hmo networks but many dont accept medicaid patients in their offices instead many spend an afternoon every one or two weeks seeing medicaid patients at a clinic set up in a building that once housed benton harbors hospital the doctors say they prefer the arrangement because the clinic which is run by the st joseph hospital pays them a flat rate for the afternoon instead of medicaid fees for each service they dont have to worry about the administrative hassle of filing claims or no show patients a common problem since many medicaid recipients dont have ready transportation but for patients this can mean waiting months for an appointment the specialist crunch means that more of the burden is falling on primary care physicians such as don tynes dr tynes runs one of the few primary care practices left in benton harbor three years ago he left his job as a salaried physician in a local community health center to set up his own practice in a former dry cleaning shop across from benton harbor high school "i dont want to pull any punches taking care of people " says dr tynes "im a spiritual man not a businessman " in his waiting room gospel movies play round the clock on a dvd player and patients can sign up for his weight loss coaching on a recent day out of the patients were on medicaid and another had medicare or other government sponsored insurance only three had commercial health coverage dr tynes tries to make ends meet with a bare bones staff he has also cultivated a loyal patient base by offering specialty services such as sexual dysfunction treatment and marriage counseling depending on how good business is he tries to pay himself an after tax salary of &# to &# a week to support his family of five children but three times so far this year hes forgone his biweekly paycheck to keep the practice out of the red last year he cut his office staff from seven to four people "we primary care physicians are the ones keeping this medicaid system together but were the ones getting killed " he says
