style tricks of the trade picking a flattering pair of pants in a season when dresses and skirts are ubiquitous julie chaiken creative director and ceo of the chaiken clothing line likes to look a little different by wearing pants sometimes as often as five days a week ms chaiken whose label has been making tailored sportswear since and is known for its pants knows that picking the most flattering pants can be tricky "a pair of pants can be well made but the end product may not look good on a multitude of bodies " she says when working pants into her ensemble the main thing ms chaiken thinks of is proportion with skinnier pants she wears a more voluminous top and she pairs fuller pants with a figure hugging blouse she says this fall as the pants pendulum prepares to swing back toward wider legs ms chaiken says shes planning on stocking up on form fitting sweaters since shes foot however she plans on staying away from pants that are too wide to avoid looking like shes "swimming in someone elses clothes " another trend thats wending its way back into womens wardrobes is pants with higher waists since ms chaiken isnt tall she also plans to avoid pants that extend above her belly button as she believes the look will make her appear out of proportion ms chaiken always makes sure to walk around when trying on pants to make sure that theyre comfortable when she moves and that the cut isnt so wide that shes tripping over fabric she also sits down to make sure her underwear doesnt show she also checks to see whether the designer has placed the pocket in a "flattering location " a vertical pocket along the side seam of a pair of pants for example often is unflattering because it gapes as the wearer walks she says an angled diagonal pocket on the front of the pants often is more flattering
