the lefts inequality obsession the u s is a rich nation getting richer according to census figures the average inflation adjusted income in the top quintile of american earners increased between and incomes in the middle quintile rose on average while the incomes in the bottom quintile increased over the years prior to top quintile earners saw their real incomes increase by two thirds versus a quarter for those in the middle quintile and a fifth among the bottom earners reason to celebrate not according to those worried that the rich are getting richer faster than the poor are getting richer the national opinion research centers general social survey gss indicates that in the average family in the top quintile earned about times what the average bottom quintile family earned today that difference has grown to almost times greater thus sen barack obama complains that "the average ceo now earns more in one day than an average worker earns in an entire year " john edwards has famously spoken of the "two americas " while sen hillary clinton characterizes todays economy as "trickle down economics without the trickle " she declares that a progressive era is at hand because of "rising inequality and rising pessimism in our work force " the general view among liberals is that economic inequality is socially undesirable because it makes people miserable they propose to solve the problem through redistributive policies such as higher income taxes as a scholar working in the field of public policy i have long witnessed egalitarian hand wringing about the alleged connection between inequality and unhappiness what first made me doubt this prevailing view was that when i questioned actual human beings about it few expressed any shock and outrage at the enormous incomes of software moguls and ceos they tended rather to hope that their kids might become the next bill gates and in fact the evidence reveals that it is not economic inequality that frustrates americans rather it is a perceived lack of opportunity to focus our policies on inequality instead of opportunity is to make a serious error one that will worsen the very problem we seek to solve and make us generally unhappier the egalitarian argument against inequality starts with the claim that income is all relative above a basic subsistence level they say we care more about our financial position relative to others than about our absolute income experimental studies are often cited that appear to bear this idea out in one such study two thirds of subjects said that they would be happier at a company where they earned &# while their colleagues earned &# than at one where they earned &# while their colleagues earned &# in another experiment of participants chose a hypothetical job paying &# per year while everyone else earned &# rather than a job paying &# per year while others made &# thus the thinking goes the very fact that some people have less than others leads to unhappiness even without deprivation moreover the redistribution of income taxed at higher and higher levels according to egalitarians does not really hurt the rich because they tend to use their "excess" incomes to purchase what they do not "need " such as luxury cars and outlandishly large houses some go even further arguing that we should tax the economically successful explicitly to discourage them from working since their work will only make them richer and thus sadden the less successful says british economist richard layard "if we make taxes commensurate to the damage that an individual does to others when he earns more" the damage to others happiness that is "then he will only work harder if there is a true net benefit to society as a whole it is efficient to discourage work effort that makes society worse off " but the egalitarians misinterpret the experimental evidence the studies cited above dont necessarily tell us that people would be happier in a world of total equality rather they indicate that if there is no apparent prospect for getting ahead themselves as there indeed was not in the experiment people will focus instead on having more than others even to the point of neglecting their financial interests there is a fundamental reason to doubt the link between economic inequality and unhappiness if the egalitarians are right then average happiness levels should be falling they arent the gss shows that in of the population said that they were "very happy" with their lives in in and in in other words no significant change in reported happiness occurred even as income inequality has increased significantly the data do tell us that economic mobility not equality is associated with happiness the gss asked respondents "the way things are in america people like me and my family have a good chance of improving our standard of living do you agree or disagree " the two thirds of the population who agreed were more likely than the others to say they were "very happy " less likely to say that they felt "no good at all" at times and less likely to say that they felt like failures in other words those who dont believe in economic mobility for themselves or for others are not as happy as those who do perhaps in a world where there is no opportunity for advancement an important concern is how ones income measures up to others in the real world where people believe there is opportunity however ones own income potential matters a great deal more than what others are earning some studies even find that the happiness of workers rises as the incomes of others climb relative to their own because they see the incomes of others as evidence of what they themselves can achieve believing in mobility then helps make people happy is this belief a delusion does economic mobility actually exist in america today it does the u s census bureau the urban institute and the federal reserve have all pointed out that as a general rule about a fifth of the people in the lowest income quintile will climb to a higher quintile within a year and that about half will rise within a decade true a significant proportion of people will fall over the same period but the studies nevertheless put paid to the claim that economic mobility is in any way unusual millions and millions of poor americans climb out of the ranks of poverty every year those who dont rise will probably not become happier if we redistribute more income indeed the effect may be just the opposite redistributionist policies tend to reduce incentives to create wealth which means less economic growth and fewer jobs and less charitable giving all to the detriment of those lower on the income scale but more important redistribution can as the american welfare system has shown turn beneficiaries into demoralized long term dependents an accurate and constructive vision of america sees a land of both inequality and opportunity in which hard work and perseverance are the keys to jumping from the ranks of the have nots to those of the haves this vision promotes policies focused not on wiping out economic inequality but rather on enhancing economic mobility these policies include improving educational opportunities addressing cultural impediments to success enhancing the fluidity of labor markets searching for ways to include all citizens in americas investing revolution and protecting the climate for entrepreneurship to focus our policies on opportunity instead of equality will address americans real concern and make us happier to boot mr brooks is a
