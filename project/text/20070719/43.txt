home &amp family cranky consumer interior designers use your own furnishings services offer tips to make the most of what you have special to the wsj furniture may cost some less than it did five years ago but the redesign trend when interior designers promise to work with the furniture you already own is growing some blame it on the lack of furniture designs that would capture a customers imagination "why go out and buy something new when it looks like what you already have " says jerry epperson managing director of mann armistead &amp epperson an investment banking and consulting firm that specializes in the furniture industry to find out if the interior redesign services are as helpful as they are cost effective we tested five experts in seattle new york dallas and san francisco locating them through local magazines and web sites like weredesign com and interior redesign directory com we budgeted &# to overhaul one room in each city for the most part the redesigns fixed many of the problems we had on our wish lists and made the rooms more attractive and all but one of the pros restrained from making suggestions for new purchases until asked while our seattle living room wasnt a complete disaster there were several things about it that bothered us including our nonfunctioning charred fireplace and some bookshelves and two occasional tables that probably needed new homes we chose spacetransform com in part because of its snazzy web site which explained its feng shui approach to design and had pictures of past jobs after touring the room and hearing our desire to make it more kid friendly the designer walked through the rest of the house to get a feel for our space then more than three hours later we returned and discovered she had rehung a triptych of photos that were too high moved the pile of toys into the kitchen and rearranged a clutter of picture frames giving the collection more balance she also created a new conversation area by shifting some chairs around and made the floor space at the bottom of the stairs more usable when she moved one of the area rugs there from another part of the living room she kept recommendations for new purchases to a minimum until we pressed her for advice in new york a consultant from use what you have inc had useful advice for new purchases but didnt have much to say about what to do with the items we already had granted most of the furniture has probably seen better days the consultant suggested we ditch our love seat for two new pottery barn chairs buy a sheer window covering and hire a carpenter she recommended to build a wall unit and storage bench among other purchases for the couch we wanted to keep she recommended freshening it up with a slipcover from target instead of paying an hourly rate like with many of the services we paid a flat &# per room fee our floor rug was deemed fine we only needed to move it in another direction during the session which lasted hours the consultant drafted a handwritten proposal that would have cost several thousand dollars to implement it also didnt include our original wish to have the foot by foot room double as a living room dining room we abandoned that plan when the consultant pointed out that we had failed to read the fine print on the companys brochure saying that it would cost &# on top of the &# fee to make recommendations for a dual purpose room overall though the consultant had worthwhile ideas the company says the design suggestions are meant for when customers have the time and money to implement them finding a designer in the dallas area to tackle our living room dining room project for our budgeted &# was impossible we paid &# for three hours with the owner of meghans inspired interiors the extra cost was worth it although the changes she made were subtle such as turning an upholstered bench into a coffee table and moving the dining table farther away from the eat in bar area to better define the dining room the redesign was exceptional she also made use of items we loved but had no idea of how to use like an antique wooden file box she simply took the file box off its four legged stand and made each piece into an end table but the biggest change was simply rehanging our art and photo frames in a way that was clever and looked great a few days later she followed up with an email with recommendations for purchases she kept her word and listed items that were well within our budget the designer from san franciscos fix responded to our plea for help on our newly added bedroom within two days not only was the designer quick to respond she was also easy to work with and willing to work with what we had after we told her we couldnt afford much beyond ikea she suggested we remove the top shelf of a small built in bookshelf so we could place our tv there a great call we never thought of when it came to the unsightly laundry basket she recommended that we get rid of it and instead devote a drawer from our built in chest that way when guests came over we would simply close it instantly making the room more presentable later she emailed us with many places where we could get our desired swivel chairs while the ideas were simple they worked and were worth the &# spent when manhattans redesign works owner arrived at our small one bedroom apartment we charged her with three main goals for our &amp frac hour session get us more storage space make the room feel roomier and somehow make the sofa more inviting for the sofa she recommended we move the lounge chair from one end to the other it was a small change but it also cleared the way to our bedroom to give the living room the illusion of space she made our light box double as an end table and switched two bookshelves so the larger one could become our new tv stand we didnt let that decision last after she left we moved it back because we planned on purchasing a flat screen tv set wider than the bookshelf what she couldnt fix without our purchasing new furniture was our storage problem but she didnt stint on advice still while were thrilled with the new look we would have been better served if we had her come
