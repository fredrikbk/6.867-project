politics &amp economics democrats regroup for fall vote iraq strategy relies on more grass roots pressure for troop pullback washington senate democrats abruptly postponed further debate on the iraq war betting that time and grass roots pressure over the august recess will bring them the republican votes they now lack to begin the withdrawal of u s forces the decision is a short term victory for president bush giving him more time for the troop "surge" he ordered in january to quell sectarian violence around baghdad but it raises the stakes for september and october when lawmakers will receive a series of progress reports on iraq and vote on mr bushs &# billion funding request to carry on military operations after oct that price tag is growing because of new pentagon demands for heavily armored vehicles which are being sent to iraq on cargo planes at huge expense rather than by ship to speed delivery and compensate for production delays retired gen colin powell in a national public radio interview predicted current u s troop levels cant be sustained past the middle of separately there is increased speculation that military commanders in baghdad may recommend drawing down early next year about of the u s forces in iraq now nonetheless the brusque turn of events in the senate yesterday shows how both sides have hardened in the debate sacrificing comity and leaving war weary moderates with fewer options to express themselves even two prominent republican former chairmen of military and foreign relations panels were denied a vote on their proposals something that would have been unheard of in the past as personal relations and any spirit of accommodation frayed it has been harder to map a bipartisan course on even an issue as pressing as war it is clear though that a narrow but growing majority of senators support legislation to require mr bush to begin drawing down troop levels in the next four months the change is striking from a year ago when the senate defeated an amendment seeking to force a withdrawal over an even longer timeline but most of the shift has been confined to democrats and after a marathon all night session tuesday senate majority leader harry reid came up seven votes short of the needed to get around republicans and move toward passage four republicans supported the cloture motion a modest increase that included maine sens olympia snowe and susan collins mr reid could return to the issue before august but is more likely to wait until after labor day to turn back to the underlying defense bill "i am more sad than i am angry " said sen john mccain of arizona the republican floor manager for the stalled defense measure also left hanging are a set of bipartisan iraq amendments each attempting a more gradual shift on the war sen lamar alexander r tenn predicted continued stalemate until "harry reid backs off and the president is more flexible " mr reid a nevada democrat said he would continue debate on the bill if the republican leadership dropped its demand that each measure meet a vote threshold to qualify for passage barring this concession he is gambling that democrats are best served by keeping the focus on their single withdrawal amendment "its our strongest amendment and its going to be out there in august and its going to put a lot of pressure on people " said democratic sen charles schumer of new york the new senate strategy could affect the house which is slated to take up a &# billion pentagon appropriations bill before the august recess that measure covers core defense programs separate from the &# billion war funding request to be considered in september and democrats appear more inclined now to move it through the house cleanly without attaching war related amendments rep john murtha d pa the bills manager admits he is torn he wants to press for an end to the war but also fears another veto fight over iraq could jeopardize important program changes in the bill including added funding to better oversee the record number of outside contractors now employed by the pentagon including in the iraq theater the costs of iraq operations have risen to about &# billion a month and the evolution of the new mine resistant ambush protected or mrap vehicles reflects how these can escalate appropriations committees under pressure from the marines took the lead in adding funds for the heavily armored vehicles but the program has rapidly blossomed into an estimated &# billion endeavor to purchase about mraps and related equipment the administration this week proposed to shift about &# billion for other military accounts to help meet this need but lawmakers expressed dismay to learn that the heavy vehicles are being flown on transport planes instead of being shipped by sea about mraps are estimated to be in iraq and the flights have been justified to speed the equipment to troops but the transportation costs are exceptional and beyond the iraq conflict army and marine commanders have shown little interest in the vehicles in their long term plans
