how junk food spoiled megadeal nestles wellness drive scotched pepsico talks health food of all things may have gotten in the way of a marriage of snack food titans pepsico inc the maker of doritos and pepsi cola explored a merger with nestle sa in late spring which would have created an immense global food concern with increasing emphasis on "wellness" products the effort was ultimately scuttled over a host of complications according to people familiar with the matter pepsico made the initial approach according to a person familiar with the situation but nestle resisted the idea for fear that pepsis reliance on snacks such as potato chips and soft drinks would dilute its mission of building a business around more healthful food and beverage products there was also an array of issues in combining pepsico with a &# billion market capitalization with the larger nestle which carries a &# billion market value and is based in vevey switzerland there are currently no talks about a deal these people said pepsico declined to comment a nestle spokesman said the company "has not been pursuing anything outside of our stated strategic acquisition interests which are in the area of nutrition " a record spree of private equity deals has been getting the attention of both investors and the media but the pace of those deals is expected to slow down as the market tries to digest some &# billion of announced transactions that hasnt stopped big strategic buyers from stepping to the fore loaded with excess cash and healthy stock prices they are again considering the kinds of plucky combinations that came to define the last merger boom of indeed pepsis move raises the question of whats next for the purchase n y food conglomerate chairman and chief executive indra nooyi has steadily won over wall street investors with rock solid sales and earnings growth the companys shares traded yesterday at &# about in the middle of its week trading range without nestle or another big acquisition the question for pepsi is how it will deepen its health and wellness portfolio an effort it is increasingly emphasizing after reformulating some of its foods with more healthful oils in the u s it is doing the same overseas where it is also reducing salt and adding oat and grain products yesterday pepsi along with several other food companies pledged to limit marketing to children the risk to pepsi is these nods to wellness will hurt sales pushing the companys shares down without more healthful brands that pepsi can pitch to everyone its growth prospects could be limited questions about pepsis next big move are also growing as rival coca cola co has been on an innovation and acquisition spree of its own expanding aggressively into a beverage area dominated by pepsi noncarbonated drinks coke last month snapped up energy brands inc maker of glaceau vitaminwater for a hefty &# billion and is considering more acquisitions including possibly snapple drinks owned by cadbury schweppes plc ms nooyi helped to craft and implement pepsis current market strategy in the mid and late s that strategy was to transform pepsico into a maker of a broad range of convenience foods and beverages rather than focused so heavily on snacks and soda she appears to be continuing that strategy by looking to expand into or possibly acquire businesses that focus even more on healthful products and nutrition as sellers of junk food continue to be targeted by public health experts and activists and as consumers demand foods and drinks they believe will make them healthier pepsi will be under pressure to keep expanding the parts of its business that look the least like junk food ms nooyi is not shy about doing big deals she was a driving force behind pepsicos purchases of tropicana and quaker oats co in the past few years pepsi management has toyed with acquiring groupe danone sa maker of evian water and dannon yogurt nestles expertise in nutrition including a research center and recently acquired clinical nutrition and jenny craig diet products businesses would allow pepsi to intensify its research and development into health oriented and diet foods and drinks that said nestle is still a huge purveyor of ice cream candy bars and chocolate milk the company has a joint venture with coke to distribute some of its beverages a combination with nestle would also expand pepsicos international reach pepsico wants to reduce its reliance on the u s market where sales growth has slowed pepsicos international division including both its frito lay snacks and pepsi beverages now delivers about of the companys overall profit growth since late last year nestle has spent &# billion to buy the clinical nutrition business and the gerber baby food brand from novartis ag for last year it posted about &# billion in sales internally it has invested heavily in reformulating many products to be healthier betting that consumers will pay more for foods that help them lose weight age better or fend off disease for example it added vitamins to its milk products for children since taking over as ceo in peter brabeck has revamped nestles stable of brands by selling off slow growing items such as canned tomatoes and making a series of multibillion dollar acquisitions in higher growth areas since he has bought ralston purina pet food dreyers ice cream and hot pockets sandwiches among other brands nestle has ample firepower for a large acquisition it owns of eye care company alcon inc a holding that analysts regard as currency for a large acquisition given that nestle could easily sell off the stake and raise as much as &# billion nestle is one of only a handful of companies in the world that maintain a triple a credit rating and it could raise its debt levels to finance a large acquisition in october nestles board is expected to choose a successor to mr brabeck years old who will remain as chairman periods of transition are often when big mergers occur last year nestle hired paul polman a dutch born veteran of procter &amp gamble co to be its chief financial officer mr polman has been charged with heading a major efficiency drive within the swiss titan a project mr brabeck regards as one of his major legacies mr polman is regarded as a leading ceo candidate although nestles chief marketing officer lars olofsson as well as paul bulcke head of nestles americas business are also considered possible successors jason singer contributed to this article
