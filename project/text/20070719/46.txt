how disney is reviving a band still in its teens last year a teen pop act known as the jonas brothers nearly washed out of the music industry the groups debut album on columbia records sold poorly and is now out of print today just a handful of the bands songs are available for download on apple inc s itunes store but less than a year after its near flameout the group is a candidate to conquer the lucrative kids music market now signed to walt disney co s hollywood records the teenage trio will release a second album next month based on early retail orders and fan interest people in the music industry say it is likely to debut in the top of the billboard album chart disney is also grooming the boys year old nick jonas year old kevin and year old joe as television stars the shift from near has been status to frenzied anticipation highlights important shifts in the music industry ones that may not bode well for traditional industry powerhouses like columbia disney has made a cottage industry of cross pollinating stars between its cable television disney channel and its record labels and radio disney network it has generated millions of album sales for performers like miley cyrus in its tv show "hannah montana " about a high school student whos also a pop singer and various cast members from the made for tv "high school musical " disneys success in cranking out one hot "tween" act after another highlights how the big labels are struggling more than ever to capitalize even when they have potential stars on board this comes at a time when prepubescent children are considered some of the few remaining reliable purchasers of music last year to year olds spent &# million on cds and song downloads the recording industry association of america estimates a columbia representative declined to comment for this article columbia is part of sony bmg music entertainment a joint venture of sony corp and bertelsmann ag the jonas brothers seem to be moving along rapidly on disneys assembly line radio disney says that last week the brothers accounted for of listener requests mainly from kids in the station network that bases its playlist entirely on requests ms cyrus was no that week jill casagrande the senior vice president and general manager of radio disney says the jonas brothers are a rare act that bridges the preteen gender gap "boys identify with them " ms casagrande says "and girls love them because theyre cute " the jonas brothers recently shot an episode of "hannah montana" in which they sing a song with ms cyrus as well as a pilot for a possible disney channel series of their own their version of kim wildes hit "kids in america" reworked as "kids of the future" was on the soundtrack of this years walt disney studio movie "meet the robinsons " the trio is on the covers of both bop and tiger beat magazines august editions and will appear there again in the september issues leesa coble editor in chief of both magazines says that recently of the reader comments on the web site shared by the magazines pertain to the jonas brothers columbia executives signed nick jonas more than two years ago when he was a child actor and an aspiring christian pop singer after learning nicks two older brothers also sang and played guitar keyboards and drums columbias then president steve greenberg offered the trio a package deal and helped shape their sound into something more mainstream encouraging them to listen to seminal punk pop acts like the ramones sham and generation x the label suggested songs to record in their new incarnation as a secular pop rock act the groups first album "its about time " sounded like a family friendly version of green day and before its release it garnered some airplay on mtv and radio disney but then mr greenberg the groups champion at the label left after a corporate power struggle and columbia cooled off on the project after several delays a small batch of cds was released with little marketing or promotion just copies sold today used copies of the bands out of print debut album fetch &# or more online a more fundamental issue was that columbia like most traditional record labels simply didnt have access to the same number of child oriented media outlets as the disney owned hollywood records where disney aims at young fans through tie ins with its popular childrens tv shows columbias route was more typical of a standard rock band promotion for instance it hired ondi timoner director of the critically acclaimed but commercially inconsequential rock documentary "dig" to shoot three music videos for the band the label "did an incredible job of identifying the talent " says one of the groups managers phil mcintyre "and they believed in the project and gave us room to develop as performers " but merely spotting talent is no longer enough to guarantee success after pulling the plug on the album columbia released jonas brothers from its contract and disneys hollywood quickly snapped up the group the brothers say they didnt mind the hiatus created by the change of labels "we as a band found it really cool that we had the time to grow musically " says nick "we did have a lot of time " the break is officially over on june the band kicked off a three month tour around the u s headlining theaters clubs and fairgrounds playing to crowds of or more they ride in a tour bus with their parents and six year old brother frankie whom fans call "bonus jonas " they are home schooled with a curriculum from accelerated christian education kevin has received his diploma from the program the jonas brothers have also signed on as commercial spokesmen for baby bottle pops a candy brand made by topps co an ad in which the group sings a jingle is played frequently on nickelodeon a unit of viacom inc s mtv networks hollywood and topps recently struck a deal with wal mart stores inc to put displays highlighting candy and the cd side by side in nearly half of wal marts u s stores in early august when the album goes on sale "today one of our main challenges is making music available to the consumer who isnt just looking for music " says hollywood general manager abbey konowitch the baby bottle pop displays he says give exposure to "the candy buyer as well as music buyer "
