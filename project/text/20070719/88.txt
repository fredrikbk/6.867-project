politics &amp economics strong euro splits europe germany fares well france and italy less so frankfurt spats among european politicians about the euros continuing surge point up a sobering fact of life among the nations that have shared the currency for eight years some countries and industries are much better able to handle a stronger euro than others the euro which yesterday hit a record of &# in european trading is up nearly from the start of many analysts expect it to keep strengthening as the euro zone continues to post strong growth and the european central bank signals higher interest rates french politicians renewed their lonely quest to talk down the currency yesterday the french secretary for european affairs said the euros current level is out of whack with the economy and renewed calls for more political influence over european interest rates riling the fiercely independent ecb such commentary most prominently from new french president nicolas sarkozy hearken to a french tradition of politicians trying to talk the currency up or down other euro zone politicians have been mum so far but an even stronger euro could prompt more widespread political grousing and put national differences into sharper relief germany and other countries that have boosted growth in productivity output per hour of work are better able to cope with the stronger euro because they can cut costs to keep exports competitive so the loudest complaints are likely to come from france and southern europe largely by foot dragging on changes to labor markets and other areas they have lost competitiveness to germany labor productivity in germany increased last year from according to the organization for economic cooperation and development france in contrast saw just growth italy and spains productivity grew less than "the german manufacturing sector has come through a very brutal restructuring and its clear that german competitiveness has improved significantly over the last

ask me where id rank the weak dollar in my concerns id say fourth or fifth " he says "my main issues are delivery times delivery reliability and productivity " part of germanys relative luster is its inflation rate which has been below the euro zone average that helps keep its domestic costs down compared with france or italy where higher inflation rates have compelled companies to raise prices on exported goods even with the euros steady rise against the dollar in recent years germanys inflation adjusted exchange rate compared with the rest of the euro zone is lower today than it was in germanys relative manufacturing unit labor costs hourly labor costs adjusted for productivity compared with those of other oecd countries have fallen since in italy and spain in contrast they have risen by and respectively whats more many german firms have migrated to producing less price sensitive more specialized capital goods many southern european countries by contrast have stuck to goods such as textiles and are losing market share to low cost rivals in emerging markets to be sure the euro dollar exchange rate isnt the only factor influencing europes economy many euro zone firms are finding ready export markets in fast growing countries elsewhere particularly eastern europe and while the u s remains a prime destination for the blocs goods machines transport equipment and chemicals top the list the united kingdom is the blocs largest trading partner while the euro is up more than on the dollar this year it has remained fairly stable against the pound yesterdays report that the euro zone countries posted a trade surplus in may with the rest of the world compared with a deficit in the same period last year illustrates the blocs ability as a whole to withstand the

japan many of the companys european stores rely on tourists from outside europe for the bulk of their turnover and the stronger currency is keeping many potential visitors from splurging while mr zegna says he is offsetting some of his currency losses by opening stores in the u s and japan he says that "if we go beyond &# or euro to the yen that will really represent a serious threat " on the other hand some companies in countries that have lagged behind in revamping their economies are getting a boost from a stronger currency at icro coatings a medium sized maker of industrial coatings
