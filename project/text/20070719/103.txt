the expat life chinese teacher veers away from the material world online edition im going to need a new chinese teacher in the fall which will be a big change in my life my "laoshi" yechen has been a major part of my daily life almost since arriving in china now he is leaving beijing to become a monk likely in a distant mountain buddhist or taoist monastery the news was initially shocking but once it sunk in i actually wasnt too surprised one of the things i most enjoyed about studying with yechen was his thorough grounding in classical chinese philosophy culture and religion he animated his conversation with references to ancient parables guided his decision making by looking to historical precedence and was obviously slightly out of step with contemporary beijings go go aesthetic i found all of this entirely endearing more chinese now seem to be becoming enraptured by buddhism after decades of the religion being discouraged and even oppressed with temples damaged or destroyed during the cultural revolution anecdotally at least there is a small but significant movement of upwardly mobile young chinese becoming monks several people i have told about yechens decision have had their own tales of friends making the same life altering decision turned off by an increasingly materialistic culture i met yechen at a large language school where my friend tom and i began twice weekly two hour sessions six weeks after arriving in beijing we rotated through cubicles and teachers many of them young women looking at us blankly as we grew exasperated struggling to master mandarins four tones after about a month we entered yechens room and immediately felt more relaxed and confident yechen who is in his early s had spent five years at a prestigious british university and he was at once more serious and more relaxed than his peers he also spoke much better english and was happy to toss the syllabus to intuitively guide us into a comfort zone when i needed a translator to interview basketball player sun yue recently drafted by the los angeles lakers i hired yechen and as soon as we climbed into a cab he told me that he hated teaching at the school and would soon be quitting tom and i were happy to hire him and a few weeks later we began private lessons at my dining room table unlike most other expat classes taught outside universities yechen used textbooks and insisted that we learn at least a basic grounding in characters after just a few months tom had to leave china due to a family crisis and yechen and i continued with more intense one on one sessions my language skills progressed held back only by my lack of studying as pleasing as that was i also just liked spending time with yechen gaining insight into his view of chinas history and its contemporary potential and problems which he believed stemmed largely from a disconnect from the nations long proud history a few months ago yechen told me he wouldnt be back in beijing in the fall he had a great job offer from a london university with a high salary and free lodging in a storied victorian mansion when i congratulated him he thanked me but said he wasnt sure he would accept the position he had been profoundly moved by a recent visit to a holy mountain and might like to become a monk as we discussed this further it became clear to me that he was restrained only by guilt about his mothers reaction "chinese parents dont want their kids to be monks " he explained the vow of celibacy means no grandchildren and the unofficial vow of poverty means no long term financial support for the parents who lack an american style social security system still a week or two later he announced that he had rejected the london offer and would soon be searching for a monastery i was not surprised yechen speaks in ancient aphorisms with ease and without pretension one of my most memorable beijing trips was last winter when yechen took me to baiyuan guan white cloud temple beijings most revered taoist temple we had tea with a monk friend of his after which yechen gave me a lovingly detailed tour afterward we visited a small buddhist temple down a winding hutong lane he clearly held both places in great reverence his interest in taoism and buddhism was not merely academic soon his dedication will be complete next month he will leave beijing visit his mother then set out in search of a monastery he will travel with one small bag and go from place to place until he finds a place that suits him all of his friends he said think he is crazy "chinese people today think that only someone who is a failure would become a monk " yechen told me over lunch at a vegetarian restaurant near the lama temple beijings largest tibetan buddhist site yechen practices the related but quite different zen buddhism "they think it is opting out of life but i dont feel that way " as a monk he will have a simple life spending most of his time meditating and studying scriptures some people become monks as children or young adults and yechen thinks he has an advantage over them "i am doing this as a choice i understand how the real world works " "everyone is concerned about being cheated by someone else but it doesnt matter they should worry about cheating themselves that is the worst crime you can commit and if i didnt do this i would be cheating myself " the one person who was supporting him he said was his former professor in london with whom he remains close the professor was not surprised because he recognized yechen as a seeker and avid learner and was sure this was a good path for him to travel and what of yechens mother he hasnt told her yet and wont for another year then he figures he will already be established in his new life and things will be going well so she wont have to worry about him i think yechens decision is bold and honorable and that he will be an earnest dedicated monk i was however taken aback when he told me that he had visited baiyuan guan and ceremoniously burned the diaries he had been meticulously keeping for years they were his pride and joy and he planned on crafting a book out of them but he had come to see them only as totems of youthful naivete markers of a past he was leaving behind "i thought i would feel sadness and fear when i burned them " he told me "but i felt a great sense of release and peace " i told him i was happy for him but i would miss him greatly next year he smiled wanly then brushed away my sentiment "there are many good teachers " he said "you wont have a problem finding one " we both took bites of vegetable dumplings before i countered with a simple truth "sure but it wont be the same " "yes " he finally admitted "the problem with most chinese teachers with most young chinese is they lack an understanding of the deep and real culture here lets be honest youre going to forget the language when you go back to america anyhow " after two years he was acknowledging the pound gorilla in the room the cynical thought that pushed me to skip over any word or grammar rule for which i didnt see an immediate use "but the language is a bridge to the culture " he continued "and the culture can stay with you forever " and thats precisely why i will miss yechen so much and why i will never forget him write to alan paul at expatlife dowjones com or join a discussion write to me and ill post selected comments in a future column please let me know if you want to share your thoughts but dont want your letter published the emails and forum postings regarding last weeks column about overseas chinese expats in china were particularly intense and interesting here is a sampling you wrote "my friend is second third generation american she grew up in san francisco with a strong awareness of her ethnicity still she all but laughed at me when i asked if she had a sense of returning to the homeland when she first visited china " how can you possibly assume i an american born ethnic chinese would regard anything but america as my homeland do you consider your ancestral origins your homeland and if not why the double standard when i get asked where im from and i reply dallas they go "no no where did you grow up " then i say new jersey and they reply "no no where are your parents from " this continues until they get the answer theyre looking for china as in i cant possibly be an american like them no matter how many generations weve been here aw i understand the sensitivity given your experiences but i certainly did not mean to imply that a chinese american is any less american than anyone else greek south american jewish and african american people have told me moving tales about returning to ancestral homelands in greece south america israel and africa neither i nor they thought this reduced their american ness and i certainly would not have thought this of nancy had she felt a homeland connection to china i used to travel in china with a c a coworker whose grandfather had taught him a lot of chinese history culture and language his language skills were very good he sometimes embarrassed interpreters by correcting them often the locals that we were meeting with would try to place his accent and guess where in china he was from he found that he could use this to either create bonds with people that we were trying to be friendly with of create a separation when we were in an adversarial situation ed the same phenomenon is seen in korea and japan i lived in korea for two years and my many korean american friends were routinely lectured about their inability to speak perfect korean it was also exactly as you reported about china caucasians are applauded for speaking the most simple sentences but when a korean american stumbles in speaking they are all over them they cannot believe that a korean would not teach their children korean from what i understand it is also the same way in japan and that they have several words for ethnic japanese who dont speak japanese or dont speak native level japanese and that these words are considered to be very unflattering in all these countries there seems to be a ying and yang of belonging to the culture but being free from some of its constraints korea is an extraordinarily homogenous place where there are unwritten rules about nearly every aspect of culture and life many koreans find this to be absolutely stifling and are anxious to get out from underneath it by going abroad brendan ward multinational companies often make the mistake thinking that by sending a "chinese" to china they would have someone who can blend in easily from my own experience china is a "complex" market to crack for any abc even if he or she can speak mandarin not to mention someone who cannot the western cultural background makes it difficult for "white bananas" to be as effective as they would be in their western home base that is the reason why mainland china born expats who were educated in western countries are the preferred choice for many companies today richard i am an american expat of caucasian heritage living in beijing you mention your friend telling cab drivers that she is american and their responding with "no youre chinese this is an extremely limited notion of what makes one "chinese" based solely on exterior features coupled with my continuing experiences in beijing this quote leads me to the disappointing conclusion of just how insular and self oriented china is people should be allowed to decide how they want to identify themselves be it american chinese hmong gay straight female male etc for a local to tell them otherwise is straightforward ignorance that has the potential to paint a dark pall over the upcoming olympics where people of all nationalities and heritages will descend on beijing i hope that beijing and china in general can create a more accommodating view of personal identity that does not include insisting upon instilling ones own notions on others edward russell i am very impressed by your observations of chinese society and chinese people i have lived outside china for years the last eight in new york city every time when i read about china by americans i feel that i have know myself better ding gao thank you very much for your kind words as i have noted before such comments from chinese readers are particularly meaningful to me say hello to new york for me
