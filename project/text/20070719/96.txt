terror estimate this weeks release of a two page summary of the national intelligence estimate is being greeted by the usual media suspects as evidence that the war on terror has been a squandered effort we read it as a stark reminder that al qaeda and other radical islamist groups continue to pose an urgent threat to our security and that was not the terrorist one off that some liberals wish it were so they can switch the subject to global warming and after school programs in its "key judgments " the nie observes that "greatly increased worldwide counterterrorism efforts over the past five years have constrained the ability of al qaeda to attack the u s homeland " it notes that the measures put into place since september have "helped disrupt known plots" last years foiled attempt to blow up airliners over the north atlantic being just one of them and it observes that terrorist groups "perceive the homeland as a harder target to strike than on " if this is evidence of the administrations alleged failures we need more of them at the same time the nie states that al qaeda "will continue to try to acquire and employ" weapons of mass destruction and "would not hesitate to use them" should it have the opportunity that it has been strengthened by the safe haven given it in remote areas of pakistan and through its association with al qaeda in iraq that "the radical and violent segment of the wests muslim population is expanding " and that we urgently need to improve our capabilities to identify "indicators of terrorist activity in the midst of legitimate interactions " the nie also warns that international cooperation against terrorism may begin to wane "as becomes a more distant memory " although as our editorial below explains there may be grounds for optimism on this point the nie is a consensus document hashed out between americas numerous intelligence agencies and over the years its conclusions have often been proved wrong still the judgments here strike us as sound the administration has consistently warned that the war against terror would be unlike any other the u s has fought and that it would be a long one so it is hardly surprising that al qaeda and other terrorist groups have adapted their methods to changing circumstances as the nie says they have nor is it surprising that the deal struck last summer between pakistans president pervez musharraf and taliban connected groups would be a boon to al qaeda and a threat to everyone else gen musharraf is now learning that lesson the hard way as jihadis launch a wave of suicide attacks throughout pakistan in a bid to topple his regime the nie also gives the lie to the notion that the gang calling itself al qaeda in iraq is somehow distinct and independent from the one the u s went to war with after the recent arrest and interrogation of a top figure in the iraqi outfit indicates that the original al qaeda leaders "continue to provide directions they continue to provide a focus for operations they continue to flow foreign fighters into iraq " according to brig gen kevin bergner a u s military spokesman all this being the case it would be useful to hear from some of our presidential hopefuls hillary clinton and barack obama come to mind on how they intend to fight al qaeda once they have removed u s forces from iraq for that matter would they favor a u s military incursion into pakistan should it continue to be a sanctuary for al qaeda and what about iran and syria which continue to funnel arms to hezbollah another group the nie warns may be prepared to launch terrorist attacks against the u s for the past few years weve heard no end of complaints about the administrations reluctance to accept the judgments of its intelligence agencies the "judgment" of this nie is an opportunity for the critics to show they are prepared to face up to the hard realities described in this document
