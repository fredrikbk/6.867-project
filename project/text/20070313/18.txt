business technology how search engine rules cause sites to go missing some entrepreneurs have built thriving businesses largely by getting search engines such as google inc s to direct customers to their web sites but what happens when the search engines suddenly start pointing consumers somewhere else that is a possibility with which topix net chief executive rich skrenta is struggling this month the news site which is majority owned by media giants gannett co mcclatchy co and tribune co paid a canadian company &# million for the web address topix com in january mr skrenta intends to switch his site over to the more popular com web address from net soon to help eliminate confusion and increase credibility with consumers such a simple change mr skrenta has discovered could have disastrous short term results about of visits to his news site come through a search engine and about of the time that is google some companies say their sites have disappeared from top search results for weeks or months after making address switches due to quirky rules google and other search engines have adopted so the same user who typed "anna nicole smith news" into google last week and saw topix net as a top result might not see it at all after the change to topix com even if traffic to topix which gets about million visitors a month dropped just that would essentially be a loss in ad revenue mr skrenta says "because of this little mechanical issue it could be a catastrophe for us " he says further frustrating him is that googles response to topixs plea for help was an email recommending that if the switchover were to go badly the company should post a message on an online user support forum a google engineer might come along to help out "this cant be the process " mr skrenta says "youre cast into this amusing kafkaesque world to run your business " hes among a growing group of businesspeople whose fortunes are buffeted or burnished by the invisible constantly evolving mathematical formulas at the heart of web search engines the influence of search engines has only grown in recent years as they have become the de facto gateways for many of the more than million american internet users to anything they might do online they also have become a crucial tool for businesses that depend on those users finding them but as a way to lure customers to a site search rankings often arent dependable overnight sites can disappear from top results for any given search term say "miami hotels" and cause the sites revenues plummet as potential customers go elsewhere among the most common reasons for unpredictable changes in rankings are frequent updates to search engines algorithms these mathematical formulas analyze billions of web pages for dozens of factors such as the most prominent words on the pages and what other sites link to the pages in order to determine how to rank them for relevance to a query search companies change algorithms partly to frustrate people who try to inappropriately boost their sites in the results but legitimate businesses sometimes feel theyre caught in the crossfire google of mountain view calif says it offers online tools for companies to get the best most consistent treatment from its search engine it also counsels that sites shouldnt become overly reliant on traffic from searches and should find other ways to get visitors such as by setting up user forums "we have to keep improving our algorithms and giving the best search results " says google software engineer matt cutts "we cant promise that if youre no today youll be no tomorrow " the importance of appearing at the top of the results is undisputed a jupiterresearch study sponsored by search marketing firm iprospect concluded last year that of search engine users generally clicked on a link to a site on the first page of results that has fueled the emergence of an industry of search engine "optimization" specialists who help businesses try to find ways for their sites to rise in the rankings such as using more explanitory page titles companies always have the option of paying for the search advertisements that usually appear above and alongside the search engine results but non advertising results can be more significant jupiterresearch estimates that when consumers are looking for products and services they click on non advertising results almost of the time while a business changing its web address could predictably have search repercussions unannounced changes in a search engines algorithm can have outsized impact on a business marchex inc a seattle company that operates more than web sites says it sometimes gets snared by seemingly arbitrary shifts one marchex site bayareahotels com now generally ranks among the top google results for the search "bay area hotels " marchex executives say the site recently disappeared without warning from the first page of googles results then reappeared a few weeks later marchex says traffic and revenue from the site fell when it dropped out of the top results it didnt specify how much peter christothoulou marchexs chief strategy officer says although changes in rankings are unpredictable "they do a pretty fair job " he says the best way for a business to weather shifts is to have a web site with strong content "if you have a good site you end up where you should be even if you occasionally fall out of listings " he says vlsi research inc ran into a different problem the santa clara calif research company recently started a social networking site for technical workers in semiconductor manufacturing and related industries chief executive dan hutcheson was dismayed to find google wasnt including the site in its search results two weeks after it launched he says vlsi called google to ask that it include the new site and it bought google search ads in the hope it would help after vlsi contacted google repeatedly about the issue a google employee threatened to blacklist vlsi sites from its results mr hutcheson says the blacklisting never happened and the site began showing up in google results two weeks after it started "our intent is to represent the content of the internet fairly and accurately " google said in a statement responding to vlsis allegation google says it provides guidelines and online tools to help sites be found quickly for example it recommends that companies use its webmaster tools site to tell it which pages are most important and how often they change so google can more effectively find it then theres the issue topix and others have wrestled with after closely held homestars ca changed its name from homedirection ca about months ago to better connect with users search engine ranking for the site for consumer reviews of home renovators and suppliers plummeted says andrew goodman chief content producer at the toronto based company for about six months homestars lost roughly of the visits it through search engines about of which came through google "i dont think anyone has ever had a changeover where they dont lose traffic for a little while " mr goodman said when homestars moved its site it placed a computer code on its old homedirection site to tell search engines and web browser software to skip to its new homestars address thats the equivalent of a businesss forwarding its mail and putting up a sign with its new address when it moves its store but search engines can be skeptical of such notices because theyre wary of people buying web addresses and forwarding the traffic to other sites that arent as relevant to the search results concerned about that strategy topix has run its site at both topix net and topix com for awhile one danger with that approach is that it is unpredictable google will see two versions of the same page and could choose to show the topix net page most prominently googles mr cutts says the search engine should ultimately understand what is going on when a site changes its web address he says the best strategy is to move one section of the site to the new address and see what happens before switching the whole thing the internet company is open to providing businesses with online tools to explicitly signal such a change but in the meantime mr cutts says posting in a google support forum and hoping for a google engineer to take sympathy as topix was counseled is more reliable than it sounds mr skrenta is crossing his fingers as the changeover approaches and he says he has no animosity toward google "its not that theyre bad guys " he says "its just that they didnt set out to wield this level of influence over the net "
