career q &amp a how to ask for schedule flexibility when you arent a mom q at my three most recent employers some mothers with small children were allowed to work four days a week presumably for less salary i would like a similar arrangement to attend graduate school or take a side job how should i ask without seeming like a slacker a allowing working mothers to have flexible schedules can create tension among single or married employees who dont have child care responsibilities "it implies that they dont have a life " says joy damore vice president of human resources and talent acquisition at foliofn inc an online investment services company based in vienna va but its a mistake for a male employee such as you to ask for a similar arrangement simply because mothers have it says patrick r dailey chief administrative officer of herbalife ltd a network marketing company in los angeles some mothers get special flexibility because they are serious about their careers and have a plan for getting their jobs done most would prefer to work a full week and plan to do so when their children are older telling your manager you would like a day off each week for a second job sends the opposite message that you would prefer to work elsewhere before you sit down with your boss decide why you need the time and then ask directly for what you want mr dailey advises asking for a four day week so you can attend graduate school is something the company might appreciate because it may eventually benefit from your studies requesting a four day week so you can work elsewhere will likely strike a sour note "if you want to work a second job do so on saturdays and sundays " mr dailey advises even if you get the day off your request may affect your career advancement at this company mr dailey adds it may view working a full week as an unspoken requirement for promotions he says its easy to assume that working mothers who are given extra time off for child care reasons dont work as hard as other employees but they may be working harder many working mothers have told me they try to pack more into their shifts than other employees often skipping lunches and other breaks they also sometimes work extra hours at home to keep your career on track and reach your personal goals you could ask for a compressed schedule where you put in longer hours over four days if you did this while attending graduate school you might be seen as a go getter instead of a slacker send questions about career management to perri capell at careersqa wsj com
