twains roughing it in the world of commerce ignorance confidence and filthy rich friends by peter krass wiley pages &# ones image of mark twain is likely that of the rapturously witty savant an acerbic and brilliant dissector of the human condition whose outlook is leavened perhaps with the wisdom and folksiness of his old age peter krass would add another element twains hunger for money his slim volume is less a biography than a sketch of the writers entrepreneurial and investing life the result while not itself a literary triumph shows us a twain we have rarely glimpsed darker harder edged and relentlessly acquisitive the tabloid title "ignorance confidence and filthy rich friends" does not do justice to mr krasss rather momentous point which is that literature was for twain only a secondary goal mr krass maintains that the authors "primary focus" indeed his "primal drive" emanating from his fathers bankruptcy was to accumulate great wealth this theme is laid out in a letter that twain whom the author refers to by his given name samuel clemens wrote to his mother discussing his first book contract "i had my mind made up to one thing i wasnt going to touch a book unless there was money in it and a good deal of it " it is tempting to discount this statement as youthful bravado but mr krass who relies largely on letters and essays available on the internet marshals ample evidence twain was obsessed with making money and endlessly pursued it in stock speculations business ventures patents and inventions no less a work than "huckleberry finn" was long delayed while clemens tirelessly fiddled with a pet creation a board game to test peoples knowledge of facts and dates it failed twain biographies mention such ventures but generally as amusing sidelines by making them his focus mr krass depicts an ambitious and rather litigious clemens who may disappoint his fans as a young newspaper editor he is not above planting a favorable news item on a mining claim in return for a share of the lode in business he turns on any partner who disappoints him and nearly all of them do of charles webster who managed clemenss publishing house known as webster &amp co clemens wrote scathingly and in light of his own management shortcomings unfairly that "his ignorance covered the whole earth like a blanket and there was hardly a hole in it anywhere " rather than the social critic who co wrote with charles dudley warner "the gilded age" clemens emerges in mr krasss book as something of a robber baron wannabe living a luxurious life in a hartford conn mansion yachting with an associate of john d rockefeller and putting in at the ritziest hotels in europe by the early s clemens had made a fortune from writing and then squandered it on a disastrous attempt to develop an automatic typesetting machine as well as on webster &amp co which goes bankrupt and leaves him saddled with debt but he embarks on a year long speaking tour and repays his creditors in full he also entrusts his financial affairs to henry rogers a shrewd financier and officer at standard oil clemens implores rogers to get him in on "the ground floor" which is to say before the general public in hot new stock issues at the time a perfectly legitimate though not exactly folksy practice of the morgan steel trust clemens writes exuberantly "i would rather have that stock than be free of sin " thanks to rogers as well as to clemenss growing royalties the author rebuilds his fortune nor does clemens try to disguise except with wit what money means to him of his involvement in an insurance start up he observed "ever since i have been a director in an accident insurance company i have felt that i am a better man life has seemed more precious " no less mocking was his opinion of communism which he seemed to view as a scheme for entrusting the wealth of those with money and brains to those who had neither "communism is idiotcy " he reckoned "they want to divide up the property suppose they did it it requires brains to keep money as well as make it the division would have to be re made every three years or it would do the communist no good " for all his acuteness clemens was a poor judge of business prospects and remarkably credulous he had some big hits including when he published ulysses grants memoirs a venture that benefited from clemenss shrewd marketing instincts but it is amazing how often the famous twain skepticism was overcome by his itch to speculate huck on a raft would never have mistaken a promoter of a carpet weaving machine for the next edison clemens did the riverboat pilot who went west was hypnotized by tales of gold and silver no matter how often they didnt pan out ever his own best chronicler he admitted that he grew "crazy along with the rest of the population " eventually he gave up mining but his hope of striking it rich moved him to think the best of a string of inventors and promoters long after common sense would have dictated otherwise his repeated disappointment must be one reason that clemens was so tough on those he felt had cheated him lest one judge clemens as unduly suspicious several partners did swindle him business in the th century was a rough affair and clemens knew it as for his mercenary approach to books the fact that he insisted on being well paid for his writing does not in the least detract from his skill or his passion for the craft if mr krasss theme that money trumped literature feels ultimately too constrictive it is because clemens was never truly at home as an entrepreneur he did not enjoy business he promised to quit it as often as he did tobacco he was incapable of resisting the gambling urge but it was compulsion not love literature was and remained his calling what he called "my strongest suit " mr lowenstein is writing a book on the pension crisis
