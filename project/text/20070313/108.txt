the daily fix the knicks are mediocre so its payday for thomas online edition isiah thomass reward for leading the new york knicks to a record in the nbas wretched eastern conference a reported three year extension courtesy of madison square garden chairman james dolan details were sketchy as if coaching contracts are suddenly the stuff of nsa programs mr dolan handed the coaching reins to mr thomas last june when larry brown was fired and said the knick gm would have to show "significant and evident" progress in his first season to keep those reins yesterday mr dolan said he believed knicks fans had seen that progress though he did express some disappointment that sportswriters covering the team hadnt noted it suggestion for mr dolan stay away from todays papers "james l dolan is a hopeless amateur " begins ian oconnor in the bergen record "he made that official monday just in case two or three knicks fans were not percent sure the owner threw a ticker tape parade for a sub team that had spent all of five minutes owning the eighth and final playoff spot in a lousy conference dolan threw his own funny money confetti at isiah thomas the contract extension is the least of dolans sins " mr oconnor doesnt blast mr thomas whom he says is "actually a decent coach " its the timing hes not so sure about "even on the rare occasion dolan does something right he does it all wrong " he writes "why in the world would he risk altering the dynamic of the knicks recent run by suddenly emerging from his outfield pen to throw this curveball with games to go " in the new york daily news filip bondy concurs the fix loves that word sounds so wise so considered giving mr thomas extra years "is exactly the wrong message to send to the coach to the players and to the fans " he writes "thomas surely earned and deserved one more year another season on the brink the knicks are just as clearly a work in progress that will need to be judged again at the close of this season and then more importantly at the close of the next this can still go either way for the knicks " given that mr bondy argues mr dolans message was "typically hasty dolan was essentially telling thomas the job is done rewarding him in kind with that most precious commodity indefinite time " in the new york post mike vaccaro considers the two faces of mr thomas "the problem for jim dolan and for everyone else for whom the knicks are a civic secular religion is this you cant split isiah thomas in half like an amoeba " he writes "if you want to keep the part of isiah that has proven to be valuable youre stuck with the part thats proven to be vulnerable " while praising mr thomass coaching mr vaccaro writes that "isiah the gm however has long been the problem for this team he is in fact the biggest obstacle that isiah the coach has had to overcome and will continue to overcome because if these two jobs were manned by separate people what we would be saying is how much smarter the coach has made the gm look the knicks are still limited still flawed and still five games south of in a wretched conference credit the coach for getting them there blame the gm for getting them there " march madness moves from the selection committee to the basketball court tonight with florida a&amp m and niagara battling in the play in game in dayton ohio winner of that game gets to play top seeded kansas on friday yikes in the philadelphia inquirer phil sheridan spotlights niagaras star player "words werent necessary or adequate only a nationally televised bear hug could convey the flood of emotions coursing through tyrone lewis and his mother marlene as the niagara university basketball team celebrated its hard earned conference title and the ncaa tournament berth that came with it espns cameras followed tyrone lewis toward his mother the joy and the anger the pain and the doubt the fear and the hope of the last year all of it was in their embrace " mr sheridan tells the story of that embrace last april a passenger in mr lewiss car was fatally shot in june mr lewis was barred from attending his high school graduation because of death threats related to the shooting last week the purple eagles freshman guard was the mvp of his conference so what words passed between mother and son "im not that kid " mr lewis says referring to the media reports about gang violence "now im the kid who got mvp of the maac tournament as a freshman thats what my mother was saying to me after the game " neither the purple eagles nor the rattlers are happy about their play in battle tossing around words like "shocking" and "disrespect " countered ncaa selection committee chief gary walters "there are teams that would love to be playing" so whats wrong with the play in game marc carig examines that on msnbc carl might question this in his numbers guy role but the other half of the fix can confidently assert that there are approximately places on the web to get a bracket for the ncaa mens tournament and perhaps half as many places to set up a tournament pool with all the tricky math done by the little invisible elves that keep the ebays running but as dan kois writes on slate com this technological progress has meant the end of a tradition "with the death of the paper bracket has come the death of a beloved office character the guy responsible for more than his fair share of americas lost march productivity the bracketmaster " he writes "you know the bracketmaster hes the harried sharpie stained guy who organized your office pool collected the brackets and handed out the prize money he gave his heart his soul and four to six hours of each day to college basketball and now hes obsolete " you can probably guess whats coming next "for seven years i was the bracketmaster " mr kois says hes running a bracket for the first time in years but this time hes letting espn com do the work but he admits that "ill miss the tactile sensation of working my way through the bracket circling teams making a last second choice to scribble out that no seed in favor of the ill miss the pleasure of putting pen to paper and ruthlessly culling teams down to one north carolina obviously there are certain tasks that are simply more satisfying when done the old fashioned way solving a crossword puzzle for example will never feel right on a computer screen filling out a bracket feels the same pointing and clicking vcu over duke does not offer the rich emotional rewards of slowly deliciously putting pencil to paper and sending coach k to his doom " they call ruth lovelace coach love the kids of bedford stuyvesant whove taken the basketball court under her tutelage at brooklyns boys and girls high school and with reason as the new york daily newss lisa olson makes plain in a very nice portrait of an extraordinary person who measures success by "knowing i helped change a young persons life " ms olson honors that while noting that there are other measures of success "there are of course those straight playoff appearances those years of teaching in which shes never missed a day the two masters degrees she earned while going to night school and the mandatory study halls lovelace put in place the college level strength and conditioning programs those wind sprints when a single member messes up and this every single one of the nine seniors on lovelaces team is going to college " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the daily fix
