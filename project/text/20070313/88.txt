politics &amp economics house democrats strip iran provision from bill washington trying to build unity on iraq house democrats stripped language from a &# billion wartime spending bill that sought to bar president bush from taking unauthorized military action on another mideast front iran appropriations committee chairman rep david obey d wis who drafted the provision said the language was too weak to achieve its purpose and risked becoming a stumbling block for democrats on the house floor "youve got the legislative world and then you have the real world " mr obey said "in the real world if bush tried to attack iran without coming to congress for approval i think you would really have people start to make big noise about everything from impeachment to a total war funding cutoff " florida rep allen boyd a leader of democratic moderates welcomed the change as "very helpful" and appeared more open to supporting the larger package "i dont like the house playing general but im not happy with the civilian leadership of this administration either and where its taken the military " mr boyd said he made no final commitment but said "we have to get this funding passed i think speaker nancy pelosi has crafted something that can get most of the democrats and probably some republicans " the &# billion bill which runs pages and adds more than &# billion to mr bushs requests will be taken up by the appropriations panel thursday mr obey can win there but the floor fight next week is more difficult given splits in the party over remaining provisions which pressure the government of iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki to meet political and military benchmarks by oct or risk a u s withdrawal by next spring "i dont know if these are the right benchmarks or right conditions or right timetable " mr obey said "what were trying to do is put together anything that will put some legitimate pressure on the iraqi politicians to either enter the modern age or make clear they intend to remain in the stone age " liberals have complained the language isnt strong enough but mr obey said unity is more important than precise words "what will accelerate our ability to get the president to turn around is if were unified if were split then theres no pressure on him " mr obey said "its a huge mistake for people to look at this word and that word this language will change minutes after it passes the house what counts is if the congress can be enough of a bad cop on this to push the iraqis into understanding that they have to get together " mr obey said the fact that he and his old rival rep john murtha d pa chairman of the defense subcommittee have been able to join forces on the bill ought to be a lesson to younger democrats "for jack and i to be absolutely together on this issue should send a message " mr obey said "if people as far apart as jack and i have been through the years can get together they ought to be able to get together too " all but a few hundred million dollars contained in the bill will be treated as emergency spending outside normal budget limits for the current fiscal year ending sept the additional funds come just days before the new democratic majority is slated to unveil its deficit reduction plans for the next fiscal year the bill provides a total of &# billion for the defense department or about &# billion more the administrations initial request this includes &# billion that the white house previously asked for in its budget to facilitate base closings overseas but the remaining &# billion is a real increase for the pentagon including &# billion for operations in afghanistan the white house has begun to move in the same direction with more emphasis on afghanistan in a package sent to congress over the weekend redirecting about &# billion in funds included is financing for a new u s brigade to expedite training of afghan national security forces for the tribal areas on the volatile border with pakistan the administration is seeking both &# million in new economic assistance and flexibility to train and equip pakistans frontier corps a paramilitary force operating on the border in iraq the &# billion package includes funds for an estimated added troops and provincial reconstruction teams in baghdad as part of the same initiative &# million would be provided to restart state owned factories to employ iraqi citizens
