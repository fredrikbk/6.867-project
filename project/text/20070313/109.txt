tech companies bleeding red ink pursue ipo gold hungry investors accept growth instead of profit a bit more speculative technology companies that bleed red ink are once again lining up to go public and once again finding plenty of takers a number of unprofitable tech companies have launched initial public offerings in u s capital markets since the beginning of and more than half the tech companies now in the ipo pipeline are in the red the trend recalls the dot com boom of the late s when deeply unprofitable tech concerns often with no clear business models were snapped up by eager investors as soon as they hit the market profits never materialized for many of those tech companies an outcome that helped fuel the nasdaq stock market meltdown in in the aftermath thousands of tech workers were laid off and several wall street firms were accused of misleading investors by boosting the dot coms leading to a string of market reforms in the years since profits have been a stronger prerequisite for a tech company to go public overall investors have demanded more maturity from companies showing longer track records larger customer bases and bigger revenues in order to launch on the stock market by the time google inc went public in late for instance the internet search company had been profitable for three years according to its public filings now as memories of the dot com bust have faded growth is again trumping profitability as a reason to buy into tech especially as returns in sectors such as property and energy dry up the pace of unprofitable tech ipos is still far from the extremes of when of tech companies that went public had no profits according to thomson financial and many of the current crop show promise of profits to come unlike many businesses that cashed in before the dot com bust still many investors appear willing to turn a blind eye to profits if a tech company displays soaring revenues the recent ipos of networking company riverbed technology inc and storage company isilon systems inc both unprofitable but boasting double and triple digit revenue growth were oversubscribed by investors on its first day of trading in september riverbeds stock jumped more than while isilons soared on its debut in december both stocks still trade well above their offering prices the trend has carried on despite recent broader market turbulence which has featured jitters about overseas markets and u s subprime mortgage providers clearwire corp a fast growing wireless internet service provider founded by cellphone pioneer craig mccaw went public on thursday after investor demand pushed the ipo price to the top end of its range though its shares have since fallen in trading on friday security software maker sourcefire inc which is unprofitable but is doubling its revenues year over year rose in its debut a day after pricing above its expected range "theres now a tremendous willingness to pay for growth " says vadim zlotnikov chief investment officer at sanford c bernstein "weve had four years of unbelievable capital discipline now weve entered a bit more of a speculative environment again " the proportion of unprofitable tech companies that went public grew during while one of the four that went public in the first quarter was unprofitable at the time that was true for two of seven tech ipos the second quarter one of three tech ipos in the third quarter and six of the tech ipos in the fourth quarter according to an analysis by thomson financial so far this quarter all three tech companies that have had ipos are unprofitable says thomson some of the tech firms that have filed with the securities and exchange commission for an ipo since january and are waiting to go public are also in the red more money losing companies are going public in the tech sector now than in some others says thomson since the fourth quarter of for example only of energy ipos involved unprofitable companies and no financial companies new to the market were losing money the tech companies arriving on the stock market now are also smaller on average than in recent years in tech companies that held ipos generated average annual revenues of &# million each last year that dropped to an average &# million a year according to revolution partners a boutique investment bank in boston and some recent tech ipos were those of even smaller companies software company salary com inc which went public last month posted revenues of &# million in its fiscal that ended last march some of these small firms are widening their net losses rather than closing the gap to profitability salary com more than doubled its revenues to &# million in its fiscal from its fiscal but its net loss more than doubled too the waltham mass company which provides software to help companies manage compensation information had a &# million loss in fiscal versus a &# million loss in fiscal "profit isnt one of the key criteria" for a company like salary com to go public says ken goldman the companys chief financial officer "we couldve waited a year or two until we were larger before going ipo but we mightve missed the market opportunity because ipo windows open and close " he says salary com is committed to becoming profitable "within the next several years " it is easier to take these smaller loss making tech companies public now because of investor appetite for growth stories say investment bankers who reap fees from underwriting ipos bill mcleod director of capital markets at investment bank thomas weisel partners which helped underwrite salary com says it was difficult to take a company public in if the firm had a market capitalization of less than &# million now smaller firms are making the cut because investors are willing to buy into companies with market capitalizations of &# million as long as they are growing fast he says "profitability is preferred but we dont say that you have to be profitable to go public " mr mcleod says all of this is good news for financiers such as venture capitalists who invest in private companies with the hope of a payout later if they go public or are sold at a profit venture capitalists have been unable to cash out of many investments in recent years because the ipo market has been largely moribund of tech start ups to which vcs gave initial financing in more than remain closely held and independent according to research firm ventureone ventureone is owned by dow jones &amp co which publishes this newspaper the huge backlog has crimped venture returns and caused hand wringing across that industry "people werent willing to trade off growth for profitability in but now the public markets are looking for growth again " says kevin fong a partner at venture capital firm mayfield fund in menlo park calif "so things look pretty healthy" for venture capital some of the newly public companies have clear paths toward profitability

revenue when customers pay riverbed to continue to service their technology earlier this month riverbed completed a secondary offering of five million shares at &# a share nearly three times the price
