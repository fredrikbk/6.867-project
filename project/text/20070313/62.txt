maine is at war over ice fishing and the fly guys at stake is class tradition and maybe even the trout mr chick pops a coors ragged lake maine an ice fisherman fishes when its cold a fly fisherman fishes when it isnt an ice fisherman uses fish to catch fish a fly fisherman uses ersatz insects maine ice fishermen are mostly born here fly fishermen are mostly "from away " these differences have gotten an airing this winter in a legislative debate about bait fly fishermen for "bait control" say live bait fish especially non native ones get loose in lakes glom all the food and drive the native trout out ice fishermen for "bait choice" say they must fish with live bait or be driven out too "we love the out of state money its more than welcome here " norman chick was saying early one very cold morning standing out on ragged lakes ice sheet "just dont come in and tell us to change our laws you want to fly fish in maine then live by our rules " in a razoring wind mr chick knelt beside a hole in the ice took off his gloves and ran a hook under the skin of a wriggling minnow called a shiner he has ice fished using live shiners as bait since and he thinks thats enough to make them mainers "how long do they have to be here before theyre called native " he asked the non native fly fishermans answer to that forever a bill before the legislature down in augusta tried to label three species of shiner as invasive and forbid their use as live bait it turned out that nobody could prove when shiners arrived in maine and last week a committee cut the number of species the bill would ban to one a second bill would outlaw all live bait fish from alien shiners to local longnose suckers on an undetermined list of waters that "contain" wild brook trout the fly fishermans dearest catch and maines best lure for summer outlanders in &# waders a few ice fishermen the ones who call themselves "jiggers" arent complaining a jigger sits on a stool jiggling a worm on a line but most ice fishermen cant tie their hands that way they have to ride snowmobiles they have to drill holes with power augers they have to open cans of beer mr chick a year old retired apple grower who says his maine roots go back generations let his bait do the jiggling as his line paid out the shiner darted under the ice then mr chick positioned his trap over the hole its an oak shaft with a reel at the base and a spring on top he set the spring so its red flag would pop up when he got a bite then he pulled a coors from the warmth of his coat and joined his wife and friends to rest and wait in the lee of a pine stand the only sound was the rush of the wind and the burp of augers around the lake "tranquility " said mr chick his wife rena who is also said "nothing like being here watching your trap " "the fly fisherman is a fly fisherman " said their friend rick webber a plumber "thats all he does " mr webber tossed a football to his year old son spencer who said "you socialize when you go ice fishing fly fishing you cant because youre always too busy " at public hearings and on the internet ice fishing mainers are calling this a class war its bait dealers who serve about locals versus guides and outfitters who service tourists its folks who see fishing as fun versus snobs who think its an art its gluttons who catch and fry versus purists who catch and release "ethically the fly fishermen dont like ice fishing " said john whalen who farms bait in canaan and has led the ice fishing outcry "they view it as consumptive removing resource from the environment fish that they want to be able to catch three or four times in the summer " ted koffman a bar harbor democrat who introduced the trout waters bill doesnt deny it he was born in summit n j as a kid he fly fished in maine and still does but in winter mr koffman avoids the ice snowmobiles and heated fishing shacks he says "are out of keeping with the call of the loon " thom watson a bath democrat sponsored the other bait bill he was born in louisiana "my dad was a duck hunter " said mr watson "he used to say ice fishing was like a hunter sitting by a fireplace looking up the chimney waiting for a bird to fly over " bob mallard one of the states avid trout promoters chose a sporting analogy "some people play miniature golf " he said "and some people go to pebble beach " he was behind the counter of his fly shop in madison guide vests hung on the walls rods and reels were displayed behind glass wooden cases held scores of tied flies damsel nymphs lake dragons black ghosts mr mallard doesnt sell live bait business in the winter is slow "elitists people from away its a whole lot of intolerance " he said fingering a woolly worm he is a lifelong angler from newton mass where he earned enough by writing software to move up to maine and "do something crazy " he opened his shop six years ago not only is fly fishing an art mr mallard contends it has a "deeper culture" in maine than ice fishing ever did cornelia "fly rod" crosby drew trainloads of rich sportsmen to lakes and ponds here in the s carrie stevens who first tied one of the most famous flies the gray ghost lived in madison "augers snowmobiles " he said "thats tradition " to mr mallard ice fishing is worse than artless its a menace buckets of live bait get dumped at days end lightly hooked bait escapes fish that swallow hooks when they eat live bait die even if theyre thrown back and ice fishermen unlike the sporting fly fishermen take their whole legal limit home for dinner "maybe ice fishing isnt inherently wrong " said mr mallard closing shop and heading for a thai dinner "its the insistence on doing it everywhere that makes this a huge issue people against these bills have made a decision fishermen are more important than fish " for "fish " read "trout " maine a recent survey found "is the last true stronghold for brook trout in the eastern united states " in the legislature passed a "heritage" law closing the states purest trout waters lakes and ponds still nearly free of other species to anglers using live fish for bait this years bill works from a master list of more the fly fishing lobby including the sportsmans alliance of maine and the national conservation group trout unlimited which conducted the survey vows that the final number off limits to ice fishermen will be far fewer the ice fishing lobby doesnt buy that it has raised such a rumpus that the chances of passing any antibait bill this year as mr mallard concedes are zero an ice fisherman after all gets the same thrill any fly fisherman does when a trout takes his bait "its been five or six years since we caught a brook trout here " rick webber was saying just a minute before a red flag popped on ragged lake the state has stocked ragged with splake a hardier cross between a speckled trout and a lake trout but now mr chick was on his knees pulling up a small fish with a squared off tail "thats a brook trout " he said mr webber measured it against a notch on the trap "its not a keeper " he said "let it go " mr chick coaxed the fish back under the ice "thats native to this pond " he said "catching a brook trout out of here is all the satisfaction i need today " he reached into his coat for a coors "i guess " said mr chick "youd call that being a sportsman " see related letters "letters to the editor some ice anglers do it the old way" wsj march
