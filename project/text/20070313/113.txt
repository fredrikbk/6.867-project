the mccain record political candidates often attempt to burnish their economic policy credentials on the campaign trail as part of an effort to provide a fair and thorough analysis of the real economic records of the major presidential candidates the club for growth is issuing a series of white papers on these candidates today we release our third paper an assessment of arizona sen john mccain we believe that classical liberal limited government and free enterprise policies best enable strong economic growth sen mccains record in this regard could be a lot better the reduction of tax rates on income and investment is a cornerstone of limited government philosophy and a powerful driver of economic growth when the most important pro growth tax cuts in a generation were proposed by president george w bush in and sen mccain vigorously opposed them while he has more recently supported the extension of the bush tax cuts and has previously proposed requiring a supermajority vote in congress to raise taxes the extent of his opposition in and supersedes any potentially redeeming votes sen mccain was one of only two republican senators to oppose the tax cuts and one of only three gop senators to oppose the reductions furthermore his reason for opposing the cuts was taken straight from the playbook of the most radical left wing democrats in sen mccain argued "i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who need tax relief " that statement is virtually indistinguishable from the class warfare demagoguery used by democrats like ted kennedy and john kerry more importantly it was grossly inaccurate the bush tax cuts lowered income taxes and other taxes for every american who paid them in percentage terms lower income workers enjoyed the greatest savings and today upper income workers pay a larger share of total income taxes than they did before the bush tax cuts sen mccain did much more than just criticize the bush tax cuts he also joined leading liberal senators in offering and voting for amendments designed to undermine them all in all he voted on the pro tax side of such amendments in and these included an amendment he co sponsored with sen tom daschle to limit the rate reduction in the top tax bracket to one percentage point and an amendment sponsored by sen russ feingold against full repeal of the estate tax aka the death tax this latter vote is in keeping with senator mccains vote against repealing the death tax to be sure the arizona senator has shown consistent support for personal social security accounts and has voted against a minimum wage increase and the medicare prescription drug bill but those pro growth positions belie a pervasive mistrust of the free market and individual choice when asked on a feb edition of meet the press whether he would support sen lindsey grahams proposal to raise social security taxes as part of a package that would include personal accounts sen mccain answered "as part of a compromise i could im proud of the job that senator lindsey graham has been doing in his leadership position on this issue " sen grahams proposal could constitute a massive tax increase prove devastating to economic growth in this country and exacerbate the woefully low return workers receive on their social security taxes a closer look at sen mccains record on regulation reveals at best a tenuous commitment to free markets in particular his leadership role in the patients bill of rights which he sponsored with ted kennedy and john edwards the bill allowed the government to impose a set of onerous mandates on insurance coverage instead of allowing individuals to make their own decisions about health care plans in the marketplace over the years sen mccain has supported a number of other big government bills including an amendment that would authorize the government to set prices on prescription drugs under medicare and an amendment to prohibit oil drilling in part of the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska but of all his infringements on personal freedom sen mccains persistent attacks on political speech are the most worrisome the first amendment is an important safeguard of pro growth policies when government strays from sound economic policies citizens must be free to exercise their constitutional rights to petition and criticize those policies and the politicians responsible for them the mccain feingold bill or the bipartisan campaign reform act named in part for the arizona senator who gave it life seeks to squash political dissent by imposing grossly unconstitutional restrictions on citizen participation in political debate in defense of the bills provision severely limiting the freedom of private groups to run political tv ads sen mccain argued in a supreme court brief "these ads are direct blatant attacks on the candidates we dont think thats right " he thus anointed himself the arbiter of appropriate political speech worthy of deciphering which speech is "right" and which should be permitted in american political debate his law constitutes the greatest modern infringement of the first amendment right to political free speech while bestowing significant advantages upon incumbent office holders it has created neither a less corrupt political domain nor a more democratic one to be fair sen mccain has amassed a number of pro growth votes over his years in congress and his record in support of school choice and free trade is impressive as is his opposition to wasteful government spending he has battled to eliminate outrageous pork barrel projects and has courageously voted against pricey laws like the highway bill but his vigorous opposition to the most pro growth tax cuts in years and his outspoken pursuit of anti growth and anti free market policies in the realms of regulation entitlement reform and campaign finance reveal a philosophical ambivalence if not hostility toward limited government and personal freedom while sen mccains economic record is clearly mixed a careful study demonstrates that even his pro growth positions tend to be tainted by a heavy anti growth undercurrent this evidence and the virulence of his rhetoric suggest that american taxpayers cannot expect consistently pro growth economic policies from a mccain administration mr toomey is president of club for growth the groups full report on sen mccains economic record can be found at www clubforgrowth org
