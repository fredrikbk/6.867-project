result major studios are now relying more on these independent production shops to add to their annual film slates with movies made outside of the studio system "i truly believe that the studios are less interested in the production business than they are in the distribution business " mr miller says "so if they can find people that they think can create commercial product and have the creativity they are looking for theyre more than willing to set them up as a new production entity " mr miller says his firm is on the brink of hiring two executives to run the advisory group which will
