enterprise physician sells weight loss center approach to his peers doctors get training advertising and use of businesss brand when michael kaplan was a practicing internist he grew weary of seeing patients suffering from a roster of conditions that all stemmed from being overweight he also grew weary of fighting insurance companies for reimbursement seeking to solve both problems at once dr kaplan got board certified in bariatric medicine the treatment of obesity and made it the sole focus of his practice patients were attracted to the idea of having their weight loss supervised by a physician and dr kaplans business did better because patients mostly paid for his services out of pocket eventually he opened three center for medical weight loss locations on new yorks long island now sensing growing demand from both patients and doctors dr kaplan is marketing and selling the approach to other primary care doctors the goal he says is to give doctors a program that "allows us to compete with the commercial world" of weight loss plans for an initial fee of &# internists in dr kaplans venture get a two day seminar in new york where they learn the science behind bariatrics and get suggestions on how to structure their centers they also get an exclusive territory in which to operate under the centers brand for an additional monthly membership fee of &# dr kaplans center will advertise on print radio and online in that designated area and any calls to the centers national toll free number md be thin are automatically routed to participating doctors in the callers geographic location based on zip codes the doctors then basically create their own center for medical weight loss within their practice where they see their primary care patients and then carve out hours to see new weight loss patients since dr kaplan launched his venture in september centers have opened in states but some critics question whether seminars like dr kaplans are sufficient training for doctors "i completely agree that you get the best outcomes when you get a physician to individualize the patients care " says mary vernon president of the american society of bariatric physicians "what im not sure about is whether you can learn that in two days " dr kaplan says participating doctors must be board certified in primary care they are encouraged but not required to be board certified in bariatrics to become board certified a doctor has to have a minimum of hours of american medical association approved continuing medical education courses in obesity a doctor must then pass written and oral exams and have an onsite review by the bariatrics board to demonstrate that he or she has treated a group of bariatric patients for at least a year a doctor needs to get recertified every five years dr kaplans program aims to get the percentage of body fat as low as possible and to help people take off pounds without losing muscle mass patients are typically put on low calorie diets of shakes and nutrition bars and in some cases prescription appetite suppressants as they approach their goal weight they are eased back onto food dr kaplan says patients initially have weekly appointments and then often taper off depending on their progress theres a big emphasis on counseling patients on behavior modification and lifestyle changes dr kaplan says his medical approach sets his program apart from businesses like weight watchers jenny craig or l a weight loss "im trying to set the world straight that this is a disease and doctors should be managing diseases " he says "i dont know of any diseases being managed by people with no medical background " the centers aim to treat people who are seeking both cosmetic and medical weight loss but the doctors are not bariatric surgeons dr kaplan says he refers patients who have lost and regained pounds more than once in the past five years to surgeons in its advertising the center touts pounds off in four weeks as the average loss of customers dr vernon says its possible to lose that in four weeks in a healthy manner but it depends on how much weight and particularly body fat the patient needs to lose altogether americans spend &# billion a year on consumer weight loss products programs and diet aid according to a marketdata enterprises study and some people who have tried other commercial programs say they dont mind paying for medically guided weight loss elissa rizzo a kindergarten teacher from bellport n y says she had tried weight watchers jenny craig and the south beach diet she lost some weight on all the programs but the results never lasted dr kaplan put ms rizzo on a low calorie diet which involved a strict regime of shakes and bars sold by the center since last august she has lost pounds ms rizzo says shes now four pounds away from her goal weight of pounds she spends about &# a month for her visits and the food substitutes "i wouldve spent the money on food anyway " she says "losing the weight was a first priority i didnt mind spending the money on health " dr kaplan says ms rizzo is more likely to keep weight off with his plan because he treats weight as a chronic illness that must be monitored long term patient costs vary by doctor dr kaplans practices charge &# for an initial consultation and fees for a weight loss program range from &# to &# a month and could be more depending on the patients needs dr kaplan says he suggests prices but the doctors are free to set their own for &# a month at dr kaplans centers a patient gets a weekly weigh in food and counseling pamela fennewald an internist in gurnee ill signed on with dr kaplan last november after receiving a direct mail solicitation from his center "there are a lot of very dubious diets and weight loss recommendations out there that have no foundation in any kind of medical reality " she says since opening her center dr fennewald says she gets an average of five calls per day and sees six to new patients per week she is considering partnering with another physician to take on some of the load adding that its still too soon to know if her center will be profitable dr kaplan says that of the doctors who signed on two have left one because dr kaplan didnt deem him appropriate and the other due to a lack of business he says new sites open each month and estimates that will jump to by the end of dr kaplan discourages doctors from selling the program to pre existing patients "those patients are used to having insurance cover their treatment " he says "itll be hard for them to make the adjustment to paying out of pocket he estimates that doctors who join his operations will earn &# to &# a year from their weight loss business and believes that if they do weight loss full time theyll earn more he projects that his own offices will earn &# million this year or times the average internists salary of &# according to a survey of the american medical group association "were trying to do calls per month per doctor " he says "weve had as many as and as few as " call reports are emailed to doctors daily
