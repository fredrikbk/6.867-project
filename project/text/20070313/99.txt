schering plough tries to deal its way to top after spending the past four years patiently nursing midsize drug maker schering plough corp back to health veteran pharmaceutical industry executive fred hassan resumed doing what he loves most making deals mr hassan yesterday pulled the trigger on a &# billion acquisition of organon biosciences nv a dutch maker of womens health products such as infertility and contraception drugs the deal is intended to propel schering plough long an industry also ran back into the pharmaceutical big leagues and fill gaps in the companys thin pipeline of new drugs the move carries a lot of risk schering plough will be taking on a large amount of debt to pay the price tag and some analysts have raised questions about the effectiveness of organons best known drug under development a treatment for schizophrenia and the acute mania associated with bipolar disorder mr hassan who has a record as one of the drug industrys most prolific deal makers played down those risks in an interview saying he had carefully sifted the options before settling on organon "i really really looked hard and i also said im not going to do it just because i have to do it ill do it when the moment is right and the moment is right here " mr hassan said he pointed out that its difficult to find a company with several drugs in its late stage pipeline and that organon has five in late stage human testing mr hassan had been unusually quiet on the deal front since becoming schering ploughs chief executive in early he did a series of acquisitions and spinoffs at the helm of pharmacia in the late s before selling that company to pfizer inc in when mr hassan arrived at schering plough the company was in dire straits financially and couldnt afford to make any big acquisitions its allergy pill claritin which brought in nearly &# billion in revenue in had just lost patent protection the food and drug administration was forcing the company to revamp its factories under a consent degree and it faced various u s government investigations for allegedly fraudulent drug marketing and pricing mr hassan paid large fines to settle the government investigations and worked to put schering ploughs manufacturing problems behind it he also stabilized the company financially the company has posted a profit in seven of the past eight quarters helped by the success of two cholesterol drugs vytorin and zetia under a joint venture arrangement however schering plough has had to share the proceeds from those drugs with merck &amp co schering plough has few promising drugs in development especially ones in late stage human testing on the surface organons pipeline looks promising but analysts have raised questions about the efficacy of its schizophrenia compound asenapine organon was jointly developing asenapine with pfizer until november when pfizer pulled out pfizer subsequently said that judging from the clinical data it had seen asenapine wasnt a big enough improvement over similar drugs already on the market mr hassan expressed confidence in asenapine saying it would help schering plough build its business in primary care because many mental health patients change what theyre taking frequently in search of a treatment that works best for them there is room in the market for options mr hassan argued last month organon said it still believed asenapine would make it to market and achieve sales of &# billion a year the threshold for what the industry considers a blockbuster it also said several drug companies had expressed interest in striking a development partnership for the compound other drugs organon is testing in late stage clinical trials include treatments for insomnia and a compound called sugammadex for the reversal of the paralysis that physicians sometimes induce in patients to make surgery easier organons current drugs include the infertility treatment follistim the muscle relaxant zemuron and contraception treatments nuvaring and implanon some experts are offering cautions about organon in a conference call with investors lehman brothers pharmaceutical analyst jo walton said organon had a "woeful" track record on research and development and gaining marketing approval for its drugs from the fda mr hassans bid for organon was something of a last minute gambit akzo nobel nv the dutch conglomerate that owns organon was just a few weeks away from spinning off to of its stock having tested interest from private equity firms and rejecting their bids as too low akzo nobel is refocusing on its core business of chemicals and paint hans wijers akzo nobels ceo declined to comment on market speculation that akzo nobel would use the proceeds of the organon sales to bid for imperial chemical industries plc of the united kingdom icis stock soared in london yesterday analysts have also noted that u s companies sherwin williams co and valspar corp could also be attractive targets for akzo nobel represetnatives for ici sherwin williams and valspar couldnt be reached to comment the &# billion mr hassan has agreed to pay for organon is almost half of schering ploughs market capitalization in the short term schering plough is financing the acquisition with a bridge loan mr hassan dismissed the notion that schering plough was overextending itself financially the company has &# billion of cash on hand he said and organon itself has "generally very good cash flow " the deal makes it unlikely schering plough will merge with other big u s drug makers such as bristol myers squibb co or merck &amp co as had long been rumored mr hassan said he didnt rule out more smaller deals "he is an empire builder " said michael krensavage a drug analyst for raymond james up next drugs in the pipeline for schering plough following its acquisition of organon biosciences asenapine to treat patients with schizophrenia and acute mania bipolar disorder nomac e an oral contraceptive sugammadex
