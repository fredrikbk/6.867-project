should smokers get lung scans last week the medical journal jama concluded that lung cancer screening with ct scans doesnt save lives but last fall a major study in the new england journal of medicine said it did so who should smokers and former smokers believe unfortunately neither study gives us an easy answer to the question both reports use different methods that make it difficult to compare them with each other the main problem with both studies is that neither is a randomized clinical trial in which patients are assigned to different groups and followed for several years a clinical trial comparing ct scanning with chest x ray is now under way but those results wont be available for a few years until then patients have to make decisions based on the available data the american cancer society simply advises patients to discuss the pros and cons of scanning with their doctor ct scans clearly find early lung cancer the question is whether finding that cancer early prolongs patients lives or subjects them to unnecessary procedures and risk in the most recent jama study the conclusion that screening doesnt save lives is based on a mathematical model that predicts how many people should have died from lung cancer compared with the actual death rate among more than people screened the model is considered credible and has been used in other studies however in the jama study something surprising happened the model dramatically overestimated the expected death rate from lung cancer without screening in the first year of the study looking at the data the investigators realized their study volunteers were likely unusually healthy making the actual death rate in the first year much lower than the expected one they adjusted their figures and in the end concluded that there really was no benefit to screening however if they stuck to their original estimates the study would have shown an reduction in mortality as a result of screening it made sense for the investigators to recalculate but the initial glitch in the data raises questions about the reliability of the model in addition the study has an average follow up of years it isnt clear whether if the study had continued longer a benefit of lung cancer screening might have shown up in later years "the scientific community can consider the strengths and weaknesses in the same way we did " says lead author peter bach a lung specialist at memorial sloan kettering cancer center but dr bach believes the conclusions are powerful "screening " he says "is unlikely to help patients and very likely to harm them " not everyone agrees weill cornell radiology professor claudia henschke the lead investigator of the nejm study is convinced screening saves lives however the problem with her study is that it looked at survival rates how many years patients have lived after being diagnosed rather than mortality rates the distinction between survival and mortality cuts to the heart of the screening debate does screening for cancer really prolong your life or does it just tell you sooner that you have cancer without changing whether you ultimately live or die from the disease unfortunately the nejm doesnt answer those questions conclusively either the study followed lung cancer cases for an average of months although some were followed even longer the investigators used complex statistical calculations to predict a survival rate of over years far longer than most lung cancer patients live but because it isnt a clinical trial there is no way to tell whether the patients are really living longer or if they just have known about their cancer longer dr henschke says regardless of the debate patients want to be diagnosed early when their cancer is most treatable "the public gets confused" by the seemingly conflicting research she says "they need to learn the issues and decide what they want to do for themselves " memorial sloan kettering offers a lung cancer risk assessment tool at www mskcc org mskcc html cfm for patients interested in learning more about screening the international early lung cancer action program offers a list of sites with the most experience in screening at www ielcap org email healthjournal wsj com screening debate differences in the studies jama screened patients found cancers nejm screened found cancers jama showed no lives saved nejm predicted of patients would live at least years after diagnosis
