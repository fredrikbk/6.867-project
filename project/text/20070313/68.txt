lighting a spark fueled by oil money russian economy soars an investment boom transforms industries bors barter days over bor russia on bor glassworks state of the art production line here workers in blue overalls churn out windshields for russian made fords and renaults and offer a glimpse of an investment boom transforming russias industrial landscape the glass company was once so poor it paid its workers with sewing machines and other tradable goods now after an injection of &# million from belgian investors its a success story bor produces a growing share of windows for the western cars assembled on russian soil "we have a great future ahead of us " says valery tarbeyev bors chief executive "some people are waiting in line up to six months for a new ford focus " across russia companies are spending billions of dollars to upgrade facilities and expand capacity all in an effort to keep pace with surging consumer demand the activity is the latest stage of an economic turnaround that has delivered seven years of robust growth fueled by russias vast energy sector but ranging well beyond it the boom goes a long way to explain russias new assertiveness on the world stage the revival dating roughly back to the election of vladimir putin is also a major reason for the presidents enormous popularity under mr putin russias per capita gross domestic product has quadrupled to nearly &# and about million people have been lifted out of poverty global corporations such as intel corp and ford motor co are fast expanding their russian operations for the first time since the end of the soviet union opinion polls show more people are optimistic about the future than pessimistic that confidence is reflected in mr putins high approval ratings which consistently top russias recovery began as a bounceback after the financial crash with a weakened ruble domestic manufacturers were better able to compete with costly imports once idled factories were pressed into service and output rose then as global crude prices climbed the country saw a huge influx of money further fueling growth as russias recent oil windfall stimulated domestic demand imports began to escalate local companies found they had to invest in more efficient technology to stay competitive at the same time russias once shaky banks shored up lending to industry while falling inflation reduced the cost of borrowing perhaps most importantly political stability under mr putin gave companies the confidence to invest in their future businesses are now plowing profits back into fixed capital assets such as machinery and new buildings last year investment rose by one of the highest annual rates since the soviet collapse whereas companies in the natural resource sector once accounted for most spending these days food processors and auto makers are also feeding the growth economists say the diversified investment base assures further growth even if oil prices drop nizhny novgorod the region that is home to bor shows how wealth once confined to russias cash rich energy sector is now trickling to other industries "we have no oil gas or gold " says gov valery shantsev "yet our industrial growth rate was double the national average last year " nizhnys economy grew by in as factories making everything from hair care products to beer reinvested in new production lines foreign companies like swedish retailer ikea and citigroup inc also arrived to set up new operations during czarist rule nizhny was russias trading capital one of its most cosmopolitan cities and the place where european grain prices were set "we used to have a saying " says mr shantsev "if st petersburg is russias head and moscow its soul then nizhny is its pocketbook " but under the soviets nizhny became a bastion of the countrys defense industry and was declared off limits to foreigners it was so isolated that moscow sent dissident andrei sakharov into internal exile there in when the soviet union collapsed a dynamic young governor named boris nemtsov opened up the region again appointed by the kremlin in he was one of the first regional leaders to privatize local shops services and agricultural land and in the process attract foreign investors under him nizhny became a lab for economic reform "nemtsov was on tv every day with his wild frizzy hair saying wake up go back to your roots and do business " says kendrick white an american consultant who has lived in nizhny since but he was powerless to stop the economic slump then engulfing russia stripped of government orders and subsidies nizhnys defense plants its biggest employers were pushed toward bankruptcy bor glassworks also struggled strapped for cash it and other companies resorted to bartering one big russian auto maker for instance traded cars for glass bor in turn used the autos to settle up with its sand suppliers another customer a factory near moscow once owned by singer co paid for bors glass with sewing machines which were then given to employees in lieu of wages "we were in a constant state of panic " recalls mr tarbeyev the ceo "when money came in you had to decide whether to spend it on wages electricity or raw materials you never had enough for everything " mr tarbeyev realized bor wouldnt survive on its own and started looking abroad for partners finally in glaverbel sa the belgian unit of japans asahi glass co bought a stake which it increased to over the next eight years bor gained the financial security it had lacked for most of the decade meanwhile nizhnys business climate was souring mr nemtsov moved to moscow to join the government and in voters elected gennady khodyrev the regions soviet era boss as governor he did little to encourage investment when executives from toyota motor corp came to scope out sites for an assembly plant he famously refused to meet them sending a deputy instead his constant run ins with the regional legislature slowed down decision making enterprise choked amid red tape and raids by tax police say local business owners things began to change in when mr khodyrevs term expired mr putin who had abolished regional elections for governors stunned nizhnys elite by appointing an outsider to replace him valery shantsev then deputy mayor of moscow kremlin officials hoped that mr shantsev could bring prosperity to nizhny just as he had done in russias capital he helped turn moscow from a dark dowdy city to a glitzy metropolis crowded with western style shopping malls and towering office blocks mr shantsevs can do style was a change from the stodgy bureaucracy of his predecessor but it also had little in common with mr nemtsovs free market liberalism instead it smacked of moscow where the charismatic mayor yuri luzhkov rules the roost and city hall has a hand in nearly all major business ventures and construction projects some nizhny businessmen worried that same cronyism would spread to their city they feared mr shantsevs dictatorial style even today some legislators complain that important laws are rubber stamped with little or no debate a bald gruff year old who served for decades as a communist functionary mr shantsev acknowledges that his rivals call him a despot he brushes off the criticisms russias problem throughout the s he says was too much democracy "the idea was the more people there are making decisions the more democracy there is " he says "thats not right " while his politics may be polarizing few dispute that his arrival has improved nizhnys economy shortly after taking power he summoned the regions business elite into his office and warned them against evading taxes coming just a year after the yukos affair when russias largest oil company was crushed by multibillion dollar back tax bills they didnt need to be told twice budget revenues soared he then tried to improve nizhnys reputation among investors he created a one stop shop that fast tracked the approval of investment projects and publicly dressed down subordinates for foot dragging local business leaders nicknamed him "the tank " authorities boast that over the past year they have approved investments ranging from housing developments to factories the projects worth &# billion are expected to create as many as new jobs over the next three years "shantsev has a vision he makes things happen " says robert felczak manager of nizhnys mega mall a &# million shopping center operated by ikea which opened in october under mr shantsev nizhny has become a symbol of the investment boom sweeping through russias big provincial cities the skyline is a forest of cranes as new houses hotels and office blocks sprout up porsche and audi showrooms dot suburban areas while logos like citibank and hugo boss jostle for attention on nizhnys main drag the changes impress dave molinari co site manager of intels nizhny facility he says he was "shocked" by nizhny when he first visited years ago "it was dirty with dilapidated buildings and disastrous roads " he says now he says "i marvel every day at the changes " investment rates in russia are still far lower than in other booming economies amounting to of gross domestic product compared to in china some worry thats not enough to keep the economy afloat should oil prices plummet despite a kremlin drive to diversify away from oil and gas russia is far from becoming an export base for western manufacturers as china and some eastern european countries now are political problems like corruption and russias autocratic style of government could also imperil the current rebound "in russia with the increased state involvement in the economy you dont see entrepreneurial dynamism on the scale of the u s and china " says john litwack lead economist at the world banks moscow office "if they really want an innovation economy they need to decentralize " but russian and foreign companies are confident enough in the future to invest nizhny has recently seen a huge influx of capital much of it riding on the boom in consumer related sectors like retail construction and manufacturing russian oil giant oao lukoil has announced a &# million upgrade of its nizhny refinery to produce high quality gas for imported cars oao sibur holding a big russian chemicals company is lavishing nearly &# million on a new plant to make pvc vinyls for plastic windows cables and building materials bor glassworks has been a big winner in the revival the only russian glass producer that makes car windshields to international standards its a major supplier to western auto giants now assembling cars in russia sales of foreign brand cars topped the one million mark in up fourfold in three years since bors sales have more than doubled to &# million its belgian owners just spent &# million on a new line to make a special laminated glass ford and renault sa are already customers next on the list is toyota which is building a plant near st petersburg "we have the makings of a boom not only for auto makers but also for manufacturers of parts like us " says mr tarbeyev companies that came in under the old administration are also ramping up intel which set up a software development lab here in has increased its staff from to and will open offices in a new "technopark" being created by mr shantsev beer maker heineken nv is investing around &# million in a big upgrade of a nizhny brewery it bought in even older soviet era industries are seeing a turnaround a shipyard that once built nuclear submarines now makes oil tankers for export the mig jet fighter plant produces a seat air taxi that shuttles ceos between nizhny and other volga river cities its also benefiting from the explosion in russian defense spending winning a huge new contract to upgrade the countrys fleet of mig interceptors small businesses are faring well too one of them is karina a furniture maker owned by dmitry birman he started out in the early s selling posh italian pieces to nizhnys nouveaux riche in he invested his profits in a small furniture factory hed gotten his first break during russias crash when most people couldnt afford imported beds and wardrobes but the business really took off in when russias oil boom gained momentum orders for furniture from new private hotels and office blocks surged more recently increased state spending on health and education has meant a flurry of contracts for new school desks hospital bedside tables and kitchens for new low cost housing projects to keep up with demand mr birman is budgeting about &# for a new production
