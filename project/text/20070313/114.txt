the middle seat an l a airport attempts to take off in the late s los angeles bought up acres of land about miles northeast of the city to build a huge new international airport come june after rabbits get chased out of an old terminal a couple of daily flights will actually take off ual corp s united airlines will begin flying seat regional jets between san francisco and la palmdale regional airport the "la" was recently added to the airports name los angeles is spending heavily to open up palmdale and entice united by covering losses handling advertising and marketing and shining up the dusty outpost the citys airport agency los angeles world airports likely will spend an astounding &# or more for every passenger who uses the airport in the next year the airport may pay more than the passenger "if you believe this is an investment in our future for air travel for southern california it cant be avoided " says paul haney lawas deputy executive director palmdale which today is home to top secret air force projects and acres of pistachio trees shows how far big cities have to go to try to relieve airport congestion and find room for growth the commercial airport consists of a s era terminal which is currently being refurbished for the new united flights those flights are scheduled to begin june the port authority of new york and new jersey last month agreed to pay &# million to buy the lease on stewart airport in newburgh n y about miles north of manhattan hoping to further expand the former air force base into a viable fourth major airport for new york city the city of chicago has been financially supporting the gary ind airport which has been renamed gary chicago international airport in hopes of developing passenger service and eventually becoming a third big airport for chicago miles from the chicago loop getting airlines to serve satellite airports far from downtown can be a tough sell lawa offered to cover &# million of airline losses partly funded by a &# federal grant plus provide &# million of free rent marketing and other goodies only united and delta air lines inc bid and lawa selected united largely because it has more frequent fliers in the area the palmdale land mostly desert dotted with joshua trees is five times as large as lax it was bought with the idea of building a vast new airport as denver dallas and kansas city mo did today palmdale is an eclectic california mix of hollywood stealth aircraft and agriculture with two long super strong runways owned by the air force the airport is home to air force plant where defense contractors develop highly classified aircraft projects the space shuttle was built here and palmdale has lockheed martins "skunk works" and boeing co s "phantom works " the companies aircraft research and development facilities a giant hangar where the b bomber was built has been turned into a hollywood sound stage where "the terminal" and some of the "pirates of the caribbean" series have been filmed lawa is also the landlord for a nine hole golf course a grass sod farm and a pistachio farm on irrigated acreage onions and carrots are grown on airport land too while several earlier attempts at commuter airline flights from palmdale to los angeles palm springs and phoenix failed in the s lawa and local officials hope that the fast growing area is big enough to support an airport with regional jets feeding hubs of several carriers if it works then palmdale could become a sixth commercial airport in the los angeles basin "this can provide relief to other congested facilities like lax " says palmdale mayor jim ledford having commercial flights at the airport wont be a security problem because top secret projects already have to be kept under wraps from public view according to air force lt col ronald hirtle the commander of plant "we always have a security issue " he says some test flights are done at night some projects are trucked to edwards air force base nearby for more secure testing lawa plans an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at the workers at plant including palmdale airport ads on stripes in employee parking lots the pitch is that palmdale will be a no hassle airport with free parking and a walk of only about yards to airplanes for military officials and contractors heading east to washington or other destinations a one hour commuter flight from palmdale to uniteds san francisco hub will be quicker than a two hour drive to los angeles if palmdale flights get filled and service expands lawa may one day build a new terminal and if the airport really takes off build its own runways to keep from crowding air force traffic if the service doesnt work the airport organization may decide to sell the land and give up "this is the last chance to make this go " says mr haney los angeles long ago gave up the idea of replacing lax but the city does have a long term airport capacity problem community groups dont want to see lax expand beyond million passengers a year and the number of gates has been capped as part of agreements with neighborhoods voters in burbank approved a moratorium on any construction at that airport orange countys airport has a cap on passengers long beach has a limit on the number of commercial flights only ontario about miles east of lax and palmdale have unfettered growth potential with air travel forecast to double by in southern california "the whole region is really dependent on those two airports " said mr haney the southern california association of governments estimates million passengers will use palmdale airport by that would be remarkable considering ontario today handles about seven million passengers a year but with capacity capped at most other airports growth in air travel may not have many other places to go
