failure to communicate for more than two decades the nations first responders to emergencies have had to contend with radio communications that were not up to the task each time a major calamity such as the oklahoma city bombing or hurricane katrina throws a spotlight on the problem a blue ribbon panel is convened and each time the panel invariably offers the same prescription more funding and more radio spectrum for public safety agencies its no different this time around responding to the commissions recommendations congress has given public safety communications mhz of the mhz of electromagnetic spectrum that will become available as television migrates from analog to digital signals over the next two years the rest is to be auctioned and first responders will also get &# billion in equipment grants from the proceeds of the auctions sen john mccain has upped the ante introducing legislation early this month to allocate half of the spectrum now slated for commercial auction to public safety meanwhile a bill to implement the commission recommendations that recently passed the house and is right now being debated in the senate establishes yet another public safety communications grants program that could cost billions but this kind of treatment has never solved the problem it targets the symptoms not the disease first responders often cannot communicate with each other because the federal government assigns to each of the public safety agencies in the country thats every hometown fire and police department their own radio license and piece of the spectrum with which to build out a communications system this is undoubtedly beneficial in so far as it affords localities great flexibility to build a system that best suits their needs but it comes at a cost more often than not the custom systems cant "talk" to each other fortunately the fcc has recognized the drawbacks of the old way of doing business and in an ongoing proceeding it has put forth the idea of creating an interoperable national broadband network using of the mhz of spectrum that congress has allocated for public safety meanwhile nextel founder morgan obrien has been pushing a new venture called cyren call to create a public private network for first responders his interoperable network would be built by the private sector and first responders would subscribe to it just as consumers subscribe to cell phone networks an added bonus the capacity that public safety agencies dont use on the network would be available to commercial subscribers increasing the networks overall customer base and thereby improving economies of scale this would be a terrific proposal but for a couple of serious hitches cyren call would build the network on mhz of spectrum now designated for auction but which would instead be sold to a nonprofit corporation at a discounted rate the drawback the federal treasury would needlessly lose out on the revenue from an auction and consumers would needlessly do without the new services and lower prices that commercial carriers would offer if that portion of the spectrum were sold at full market value why needlessly because as the fcc proceeding affirms a national broadband network for first responders can be built over spectrum already designated for public safety use frontline wireless another private initiative is backed by former fcc chairman reed hundt it involves building an interoperable network over spectrum purchased at auction but frontline wants the fcc to restrict that spectrum to public safety use the restriction would dramatically reduce what the spectrum would fetch for the treasury at auction sen mccains bill would facilitate both types of approaches here is a better idea offer cyren call frontline and others the opportunity to bid on spectrum already restricted to public safety use that would allow firms to build national interoperable networks without affecting how much spectrum will be available for commercial use at the very least if spectrum now slated for commercial auction must be used the government should identify an equal amount of existing public safety spectrum that can be auctioned commercially once the new public safety networks are built whatever path we take we should ensure that at least two competing networks are built this works well for wireless services such as cell phones subscribers to one service have no trouble speaking to subscribers on another while prices are kept low a private sector national network for public safety first responders is not an untested idea in the u k the national network that supports police fire and over a hundred other public safety services is owned and operated by o a private firm we can do even better using competition to spur
