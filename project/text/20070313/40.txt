health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q i am disappointed that weight watchers wasnt included in the jama study that reviewed different diets why wasnt it j k a several readers wrote to express their concern that some of their favorite diets such as weight watchers or the south beach diet werent included in a recent jama review of popular diets the jama research studied overweight women who followed one of four popular diets the studys lead author stanford university researcher christopher gardner said he designed the study in hopes of studying popular diets that consumers typically learn about from a book thats why weight watchers which is typically presented at organized meetings wasnt included the four diets that were included were "dr atkins new diet revolution " the lowest carbohydrate diet studied "enter the zone " by barry sears which also restricts carbs but not as much as atkins the "eat more weigh less" plan by dean ornish which drastically cuts fat and "the learn manual for weight management " a higher carb diet that essentially follows government health guidelines dr gardner says the atkins zone and ornish diets were included because they all at one time were best selling books the diets also represented a wide range of carbohydrate levels the learn diet was included because the researchers wanted to include a book based diet that could most closely represent national health guidelines finally the south beach diet wasnt included because it rose to popularity after dr gardner had already proposed his study however a few years ago jama published a different study that did compare weight loss among atkins ornish zone and weight watchers dieters the results werent markedly different showing that everyone lost a little weight but none of the diets produced dramatic differences in the jama report the atkins dieters lost pounds the zone dieters lost pounds weight watchers lost pounds and ornish dieters lost pounds that said many nutritionists prefer the weight watchers plan because it gives dieters practical tools without giving up any entire food category q i read your article on the new vitamin lowdown i am a year old female who is an avid exerciser i have been taking prescription prenatal vitamins for my overall health for about five years what is your opinion on this m g a prenatal vitamins typically have more folic acid iron and calcium than regular daily multivitamin supplements you need to look at the package to find out the exact ingredients in the vitamins you are taking folic acid consumption reduces a womans risk of giving birth to a baby with neural tube defects such as spina bifida the centers for disease control and prevention has been pushing for women in their reproductive years to pay more attention to folic acid women who go on low carbohydrate diets are particularly at risk because they typically are eating fewer fortified and folate rich foods if youre trying to get pregnant it makes sense for you to take a prenatal vitamin the added iron might be good for you if you are at risk for anemia the calcium might be good for your bones but most women dont benefit from calcium until after about age however if you arent trying to get pregnant theres no real need for you to use prenatal vitamins one concern is that all the extra folic acid could potentially mask problems caused by a relatively rare condition called pernicious anemia which can lead to a deficiency of vitamin b you should talk with your doctor about whether you should just switch to a daily multivitamin email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
