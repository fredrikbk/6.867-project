why generic doesnt always mean cheap zocor case shows drugstores may offer only small savings over brand name drug prices the great promise of cheap generic drugs is taking a bumpy road to arrival case in point zocor one of the most commonly prescribed pills in the u s which lost patent protection last june multitudes of patients have switched to generic versions of the cholesterol lowering drug lured by lower insurance co payments or the promise of a significant price drop for those who pay out of pocket as predicted the price that many insurers pay for generic zocor has dropped dramatically but the price that pharmacies charge patients who pay cash remains high in many locations with wide variations by vendor at online pharmacy walgreens com for instance the price for tablets of a milligram dose of merck &amp co s zocor is &# compared with &# for simvastatin the generic version and last week the same dose of simvastatin cost &# at cvss web site compared with &# for zocor after a call from a reporter cvs said it would drop its simvastatin price to &# as part of an "ongoing price analysis " at a time when policy makers are searching for ways to cut health care costs generic drugs are often viewed as one of the most straightforward solutions but as the situation with generic zocor illustrates prices can vary wildly and may not be nearly as cheap as expected generics of a number of other notable drugs that came off patent recently including the antidepressant zoloft the antibiotic zithromax and allergy drug flonase have also so far failed to deliver big savings in many cases "were not seeing that sharp a drop off" in price among generic drugs that have come out in the past couple of years says jim yocum executive vice president of destinationrx inc a los angeles pharmacy data and software company "were just not seeing it " to be sure even for the uninsured generics still typically cost less than their branded counterparts and at big clubs such as costco wholesale and sams club out of pocket prices for generics do generally plummet simvastatin costs &# for pills of the milligram dose at a sams club for which the company provided price information but just how far and how fast generic prices fall depends on a number of factors among them how many generics makers sell the drug how much competitive pressure pharmacies feel whether there is another alternative such as a different generic in the same class of drugs and whether a particular generics maker gets an initial exclusivity period by law the first generics maker to challenge a patent on a branded drug and prevail wins six months of exclusive sales for the more than million americans without health insurance plus perhaps millions more whose insurance plans dont cover drugs the lesson is to shop carefully some pharmacies list prices online and certain web sites will compare prices from a number of competitors if your pharmacy doesnt list prices a few phone calls to some competitors can mean big savings if youre willing to travel try pharmacies that arent very close to each other and are less likely to react directly to each others prices the growing variety of outlets for prescription drugs with wholesalers and online vendors joining the chains and mom and pops brings a range of business models that affect how generics are priced at sellers where drugs are a significant driver of revenues prices may remain high sometimes as with generic zocor prices stay high even after a six month exclusivity period ends when additional generics makers start

chain drugstores argue that their business model is different from a company like costco or sams club cvs rite aid and walgreen co all say that about two thirds of their revenues come from prescription drugs "we dont sell snow tires " says mike deangelis a spokesman for cvs pharmacy "the core of our business is the pharmacy " mr deangelis wouldnt say how much cvs pays for generics but confirmed profit margins on generics are generally bigger than for branded drugs on all drugs mr deangelis says cvss prescription drug profit margins are to a spokeswoman for walgreen gave a similar figure and a spokeswoman for rite aid said the companys prescription drug margins were very thin walgreen spokeswoman tiffani bruce says there can be a lag in retail price reductions if the company had stocked up on large quantities of a generic before the manufacturers prices dropped she also says profit margins on generics help the pharmacy chain make up for much smaller profits or even losses on branded drugs the beginning of a generics availability "represents a small window where drugstores are able to recover from the weight of carrying all these unprofitable prescriptions " ms bruce says patients whose drugs are covered by insurance often dont notice subtle shifts in generics prices because insurers typically allow patients to pay the lowest co payments for generics as soon as they are available as big purchasers insurance companies can often make steep cuts in what they will pay for widely used generic drugs insurer humana inc louisville ky is paying pharmacies about &#
