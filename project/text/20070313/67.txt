networks divine a sellers market strong scatter buying may bring high prices in upfront negotiations it might come as a surprise given all the talk about pressure on tv advertising but network ad sales chiefs are starting to feel a little optimistic after suffering through difficult "upfront" bargaining in the past couple of years they have reason to think this years upfront market where networks sell the bulk of their ad time for the fall season might not be so bad recent conditions in the so called scatter market where ad time that still is available is sold close to airdate have been healthier than in years past on unusually strong demand from advertisers "the market is pretty strong " says mike shaw abc television sales and marketing president adding that scatter pricing is "well into double digit increases" over prices set in last years upfront market similar comments were made by cbs corp chief executive leslie moonves at an investor conference march while nbc television has seen high single digit increases in primetime prices according to a person familiar with the situation while strong scatter conditions in winter dont guarantee a robust upfront market in the spring they have been an indicator in the past that networks will have leverage in the past couple of years scatter prices were weak in the months leading up to the upfront in television ad sales though history is no longer a good guide to the future major changes in the ways marketers buy advertising and the ways consumers watch television have made the upfront process much more complicated the scatter market "is certainly a positive sign " mr shaw says but whether it bodes well for the upfront the walt disney units executive adds "who knows " the growth of alternative ad venues like the internet along with rising use of devices that allow people to skip tv commercial breaks has caused some advertisers to put less emphasis on network tv making it easier for advertisers to be more assertive in dealings with networks partly as a result the overall network upfront market was flat to down in the past couple of years in preparation for this years bargaining media buyers make it clear they wont accept any network arguments for raising prices "i dont think the economic factors out here are really going to allow for any kind of significant price increases " says rino scanzoni chief investment officer for groupm a consortium of media buying operations owned by wpp group "if there are any increases they are going to be relatively moderate and in some cases i dont expect there will be any price increases at all " still networks and advertisers are trying to read the tea leaves one issue is whether johnson &amp johnsons widely publicized decision last year to sit out the upfront in favor of buying whatever ad time it wanted later in the scatter market was a mistake at the time the decision was seen as signaling how power in the tv industry was shifting from networks to advertisers who now have a much greater array of advertising venues from which to choose j&amp j wanted to coordinate its ad buying decisions with its business planning cycle it was a gamble that demand for ad time would be weak enough during the tv season that the company wouldnt pay more than if it had lined up ad deals during the upfront at the investor conference mr moonves left no doubt about his view of j&amp js gambit "it ended up not being such a good decision for them " he said kim kadlec j&amp js chief media officer says the company was pleased with its decision and "based on our experience plan to continue" sitting out the upfront late last year a person familiar with the situation said j&amp j was buying ad time in the scatter market at the same prices it would have paid in the upfront the episode may give advertisers pause as they contemplate this years upfront strategy not every advertiser is as powerful as j&amp j which may have been able to make better scatter buys than smaller marketers on the other hand bigger marketers may feel emboldened to follow suit this year the other big issue likely to strongly influence the upfront negotiations is the contentious argument between networks and advertisers over how to measure viewing by people using digital video recorders a number that will reach million by year end according to interpublic groups magna global this argument has become more heated since nielsen media research the tv ratings firm unveiled plans to measure viewership of commercials networks claim more people watch their programs thanks to dvrs advertisers dont want to pay for those dvr equipped viewers because many of them are watching recordings of programs after theyve aired and theyre fast forwarding through ads "the networks are in a position of losing a lot of live viewing " says michael nathanson a media and advertising analyst for sanford c bernstein on may right as upfront bargaining gets down to brass tacks nielsen will start releasing commercial ratings data as a compromise to the networks the company will prepare several different sets of figures showing how many dvr viewers watched a program the day it aired as well as how many watched as long as a week after broadcast networks hope that with these data in hand theyll benefit "we believe we are entitled to get paid for the viewers that we deliver who watch the commercials even though it was in a time shifted mode " says alan wurtzel president of research for general electrics nbc universal
