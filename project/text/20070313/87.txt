politics &amp economics eu to revisit trade rule fines for dumping may have to meet higher standard brussels the european union wants to change its rules to make it harder to levy penalties on trading partners for dumping offenses eu trade chief peter mandelson has asked trade lawyers diplomats and others to a conference today to testify on how the eu evaluates complaints against dumping the practice of exporting goods at below cost prices to win market share mr mandelson hopes later to make changes that could lessen divisions within europe about the validity of dumping complaints depriving key trading partners such as china india and vietnam of a weapon in trade negotiations where they have attacked him over penalties they considered unfair mr mandelson yesterday declined to comment on what changes he will make or why "for the moment we are in listening mode not in talking mode " said peter power mr mandelsons spokesman trade lawyers say there are several ways in which mr mandelson could change the current rules in order to make sure that fewer narrowly supported antidumping cases get approved to obtain an antidumping penalty an association of companies representing more than of a sector must support an antidumping complaint and show that it has cut into their market share that percentage could be increased trade lawyers say perhaps to by requiring broader and firmer support for antidumping measures the eus goal is to "get politics out of dumping " says trade lawyer iain macvay of steptoe &amp johnson llp the eu cant force companies to publish changes in their market share and other evidence they provide to support their claims for protection that also could be changed to make the penalty process more transparent and deter countries from lobbying for weak cases in the current voting system in which eu member countries decide whether to accept claims abstentions count as a vote for introduction of penalties that rule also could be altered trade lawyers say the eu a nation bloc that imports more than &# trillion in goods every year makes relatively scarce use of antidumping duties the eu imposed measures in affecting less than of all imports but several recent cases have been highly politicized last october when the eu imposed antidumping duties on asian shoe imports european retailers were furious because the penalties would push retail prices higher they have since asked that the eu take into account the impact the penalties would have on "community interest" shorthand for consumer prices when deciding antidumping complaints eu states voted to to support duties of on shoes made in china and on those made in vietnam when mr mandelson visited china in november he was reminded about the eus new antidumping duty on shoes not having to deflect those criticisms would put him in a better bargaining position in future trade negotiations diplomats and trade lawyers say the eu is currently negotiating new terms of trade with china and india "the footwear case was seen by many as a weak case that undermined the integrity of the antidumping instrument " says cliff stevenson author of a report on antidumping for the eu also in october the eu imposed antidumping duties on imports of frozen strawberries from china only to lift them again in march an eu report concluded that polish strawberry producers who brought the complaint hadnt been harmed by chinese competition but by poor weather and higher labor costs after collecting opinions on the dumping issue mr mandelsons office will publish recommendations "probably before the summer holidays " says mr power eu member states will then vote on the proposal
