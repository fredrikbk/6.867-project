they froze in september the treasury announcement expected as early as tomorrow marks the latest twist in a dispute that has figured in the international effort to end north koreas nuclear weapons program the u s first pursued banco delta asia in september calling the bank "a willing pawn" in north koreas illicit businesses such as drug smuggling and counterfeiting the treasury department

there and launched a crackdown on money laundering in the territory u s officials said north korean entities will be able to recover at least a portion of the funds frozen in banco delta asia accounts

may not be enough to assuage north korea the countrys top nuclear negotiator kim kye gwan told reporters in beijing over the weekend that the u s "has promised to lift the banco delta asia financial sanctions " he threatened to take unspecified "corresponding actions" if washington failed to follow through on that promise the u s willingness to close the banco delta asia inquiry helped pave the
