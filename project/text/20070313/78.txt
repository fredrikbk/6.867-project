offers to buy chrysler could come by months end activity accelerates as private equity firms meet with management the pace of activity around a possible sale of daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group is accelerating after several potential buyers met with management in anticipation of presenting preliminary offers by the end of the month daimlerchrysler is hoping to narrow the list of serious buyers so its management team can give an update on a possible sale during daimlerchryslers general shareholders meeting in berlin on april according to people familiar with the matter two years ago management was berated by shareholders fed up with a deep drop in daimlerchryslers market value since it was created in a landmark combination with the former chrysler corp the interested private equity firms include cerberus capital management llc and a group led by blackstone group and centerbridge partners lp people familiar with the matter said all three met with chrysler management last week and signed confidentiality agreements to pave the way to reviewing detailed financial and product development information on the auto maker these people said canadian auto parts maker magna international inc is also interested in buying all or part of chrysler possibly in partnership with a private equity firm and has met with representatives of both the united auto workers and canadian auto workers to discuss a deal one of these people said standard &amp poors said yesterday magnas long term credit rating could be lowered if the auto parts suppliers finances or business is weakened by an acquisition of chrysler s&amp p said the challenges surrounding chrysler including reducing capacity and dealing with unions could take time away from magnas core business but because it is uncertain whether magna will make an offer for chrysler s&amp p isnt placing magna on creditwatch general motors corp has also considered buying chrysler but a takeover of its crosstown rival is considered unlikely people familiar with the matter said despite the flurry of meetings it remains uncertain whether a deal will materialize one person familiar with top managements thinking said any offer would have to be very compelling for daimlerchrysler to accept it this person and others familiar with the matter noted that going through this "sales process" eases pressure from the shareholders who have been angered by chryslers struggles exploring a sale also gives the company a stronger bargaining position with the uaw and caw they said significant concessions from labor could make it easier to restructure chrysler and give management reason to consider keeping at least a stake in or even all of chrysler in an interview last week chief executive dieter zetsche acknowledged daimlerchrysler and chrysler could end up remaining "one entity " he added that the uaws refusal to give chrysler the same concessions on retiree health care costs that the union has already allowed gm and ford motor co was one of the factors that prompted the decision to look into a sale christoph sturmer an auto industry analyst at global insight in frankfurt said daimlerchrysler has "opened the door" to a sale but he added "i dont think theyre going to go through with it because the organization is just not ready to be split up " teams working on joint projects between chrysler and the companys mercedes benz division continue to meet regularly as scheduled daimlerchrysler employees said already the potential of a sale has helped soften the position of the canadian union on sunday caw workers at chryslers plant in brampton ontario agreed to accept pay cuts of canadian dollars us&# a week and other concessions givebacks the workers had rejected only a month ago in exchange for the concessions chrysler agreed to go ahead with a c&# million investment in the plant ardis snow chairman of caw local said it was difficult for the union members to approve the pay cuts but they realized the challenges facing chrysler and were thinking about their long term future the uaw so far hasnt given any ground but union president ron gettelfinger has said he is working to keep chrysler within daimlerchrysler under a new owner the uaw would likely have much less influence on the company under german law half of the seats on daimlerchryslers supervisory board the equivalent of a u s board are filled by labor representatives giving workers considerable power to fight any moves they oppose such as plant closures or joint ventures mr gettelfinger holds one of labors seats on the board the remaining nine are filled by german labor representatives people familiar with the matter said daimlerchrysler executives will take into account chryslers long term potential in any bids to buy the division magna is interested in using chrysler to build a business in the u s similar to its magna steyr ag unit in austria based in graz austria magna steyr assembles vehicles on a contract basis for bmw ag chrysler and other car companies contract manufacturing is rare in the north american auto industry but magna sees potential in this area because many car makers now have to produce more vehicles in small volumes these people said chrysler ceo tom lasorda skipped the geneva auto show last week so he could be in town for the meetings with magna and the private equity firms these people said the potential suitors were given presentations about chryslers product plans its china strategy and its finances these people said an acquisition of chrysler by a private equity firm would represent a litmus test for the claims of some big time investors that ailing companies can often be fixed more easily as private firms "this is the quintessential company which doesnt need to be in the public eye " says a person familiar with the thinking of one group "this is the perfect business to be out of the glare of wall street if they were private they would not have to worry about stuffing the channel or taking write offs if that was the right thing to do "
