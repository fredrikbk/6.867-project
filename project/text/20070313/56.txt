islamosocialism it is a profound truth " declared the british socialist party in a manifesto "that socialism is the natural enemy of religion " not the least of the oddities in the subsequent history of progressive politics is that today it has become the principal vehicle in the west for islamist goals and policies caroline lucas a member of the green party faction in the european parliament is a longtime activist in anti nuclear animal rights and environmentalist causes and not someone likely to describe herself as an anti feminist yet in june she joined british mps fiona mactaggart of labor and sarah teather of the liberal democrats for a press conference in the house of commons organized by the assembly for the protection of hijab the assembly better known as pro hijab is a pan european organization formed "to campaign nationally and internationally for the protection of every muslim womans right to wear the hijab in accordance with her beliefs and for the protection of every womans right to dress as modestly and as comfortably as she pleases " once upon a time feminists and socialists alike would have translated that as "subservience to the patriarchy " now they seem to have rediscovered their roots as civil libertarians at least when its politically expedient consider the issue of the armenian genocide in the french speaking wing of belgiums socialist party ps co sponsored legislation to criminalize denial of the ottoman empires murder of an estimated million armenians much as holocaust denial is also against the law yet for the past several years the same ps has been blocking the process of criminalization it helped initiate presumably in the service of free speech "additional legal and historical research " says belgian deputy prime minister laurette onkelinx remains to be done in ascertaining exactly what happened in anatolia in progressives have also been remarkably mindful of civil liberties in matters of immigration when the german state of baden wuttemberg last year required applicants for citizenship to answer a series of questions regarding their personal views the leader of the german green party renate kunast denounced it as "immoral " "a country governed by law " she argued "cannot ask questions about moral values " among the questions "where do you stand on the statement that a wife should obey her husband and that he can hit her if she fails to do so " curiously however europes progressives have been somewhat less tolerant on other issues concerning moral values and personal belief take "islamophobia " which progressives often consider akin to racism and have in some instances sought to ban by legal means in britain last year tony blairs government enacted the racial and religious hatred act which criminalized "threatening" comments against religious persons or beliefs comedian rowan atkinson and author salman rushdie among others warned that the law undermined basic rights of speech but for london mayor ken livingstone it was not enough he defined "islamophobia" as "discrimination intolerance or hostility towards islam and muslims " and regretted that criminal acts were not more broadly defined by the legislation since coming to office nearly seven years ago mr livingstone has become a symbol of the marriage of the european left and the islamist right its a marriage of mutual convenience and at least on one side actual belief in the netherlands a recent study by the university of amsterdams institute for migration and ethnic studies found that of immigrants the overwhelming majority of whom are muslims voted for the labor party in recent elections while the two main center right parties received a combined of the immigrant vote in neighboring belgium the left wing sociologist jan hertogen credits immigrants for "saving democracy" by voting as a bloc against the secessionist and anti immigrant vlaams belang party for muslim voters in europe the attractions of the socialists are several socialists have traditionally taken a more accommodating approach to immigrants and asylum seekers than their conservative rivals they have championed the welfare state and the benefits it offers poor newcomers they have promoted a multiculturalist ethos which in practice has meant respecting muslim traditions even when they conflict with western values in foreign policy socialists have often been anti american and by extension hostile to israel that hostility has only increased as muslim candidates have joined the socialists electoral slates and as the muslim vote has become ever more crucial to the socialists electoral margin more mysterious however at least as a matter of ideology has been the dalliance of the progressive left with the islamic political right self styled progressives after all have spent the past four decades championing the very freedoms that islam most opposes sexual and reproductive freedoms gay rights freedom from religion pornography and various forms of artistic transgression pacifism and so on for those who hold this form of politics dear any long term alliance with islamic politics ultimately becomes an ideological if not a political suicide pact one cannot after all champion the cause of universal liberation in alliance with a movement that at its core stands for submission this is not of course the first time such a thing has happened in the history of the progressive movement or in european history on the contrary it is the recurring theme in the early th century the apostles of fabianism george bernard shaw among them looked to the soviet union for inspiration in the s the model was mao in the late s the great french philosopher michel foucault went to iran to write a paean to khomeinis revolution in nearly every case the progressives were by later admission deceived but not before they had performed their service as "useful idiots" to a totalitarian cause but the stakes today are different at question for europeans is not the prevailing view of a distant country the question is the shaping of their own europes liberal democrats were able sometimes with outside help to preserve their values in the face of an outside threat whether they can resist the temptations of islamosocialism remains to be seen write to bstephens wsj com
