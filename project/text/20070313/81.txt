politics &amp economics bush trip theme immigration president is leveraging visit to latin america to push for bill at home guatemala city guatemala president bush is using his latin america tour to kick off a make or break debate over immigration overhaul in the u s but while many analysts say the election vindicated his support for immigrant friendly policies his waning political strength will make it difficult to muster the republican votes needed for congress to pass them into law in an apparent effort to leverage his political power at nearly every stop in this five nation swing mr bush has mentioned the pressure he is getting from latin leaders for action on immigration in bogota colombia on sunday mr bush cited the "concern" that president alvaro uribe expressed about the need for overhaul of u s rules on saturday in uruguay mr bush said president tabare vazquez had "spoken eloquently to me about the need for an immigration policy that upholds the values of america " at a news conference in guatemala city yesterday mr bush was repeatedly confronted with questions and criticisms concerning recent u s deportation actions against illegal immigrants including some guatemalans president oscar berger said guatemalans wanted mr bush to promise an end to deportations mr bush said the answer instead is for congress to pass his proposal for comprehensive immigration reform adding that he wants a bill on his desk by the august recess "the system needs to be fixed " mr bush said the first step is reaching a republican position in the senate he said adding "i believe were going to find consensus" in congress he was scheduled to meet with mexican president felipe calderon today in merida where immigration was sure to come up again immigrations first major legislative test begins soon as senate majority leader harry reid aims to bring the matter up for a vote on the floor in late april or early may house leaders are waiting to see if the senate can succeed before they take up the politically volatile issue to emphasize his interest in passing legislation mr reid will travel to mexico this week to meet with mr calderon and other leaders despite many democrats longtime support for the same comprehensive approach that mr bush favors they will need many republican votes to pass a bill perhaps in the senate and twice that number in the house republicans may have taken a lesson from the election when their anti immigration wing sustained unexpected losses in the two congressional districts where democrats gained seats in arizona both the defeated republicans campaigned on anti immigrant positions focusing on tighter border security overall republicans saw their share of hispanic votes drop to from about in according to some estimates in part because of the anti immigrant tenor of many of their candidates in addition congressional republicans lack of action on immigration overhaul in and may have contributed to a "do nothing" image and the subsequent loss of their house and senate majorities another result of the election was a broad weakening of mr bushs own political standing which will make it difficult for him to influence republicans as the crucial votes approach like many democrats mr bush favors comprehensive legislation that improves border security while creating the opportunity for more workers to come legally to the u s on a temporary basis he also wants to create a "rational" way for illegal aliens already in the u s to attain legal status without having to "kick people out " as he put it in uruguay the white house already is negotiating with lawmakers on immigration said tamar jacoby an immigration expert at the conservative manhattan institute "the white house knows its influence is limited and they have given a lot of thought to just how to use what leverage they have most effectively " she said "theyve decided that this year unlike last it makes sense to get a bipartisan deal as soon as possible " many advocates hope newly empowered democrats will feel obliged to pass legislation to show the public and their hispanic supporters they can deliver on a bipartisan basis if that doesnt happen by the end of the year though there is concern positions will again start to polarize before the campaign the apparent success of republican led increases in enforcement could smooth the way for a deal according to the department of homeland security border apprehensions are down over the same five month period a year ago from seizures of would be border crossers at last years start of the annual "migrant season" to through the end of february joel millman and sarah lueck contributed to this article
