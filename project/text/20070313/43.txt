denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance then the five stages of ncaa tournament bracket picking could be labeled acceptance guts second guessing reconciliation and resignation stage acceptance before you even start to evaluate the games identify any pre existing biases you have that might influence your picks in my case  huge florida fan  sucker for tournament "experience " specifically teams with a chip on their shoulder from an unsatisfying ending last year  hate duke the final disclosure worth noting is that while i have covered the ncaa tournament as college basketball editor for espn com and as a columnist my picks have never been particularly accurate last march my unborn son whose picks were "intuited" by his mom to be finished in the s out of in my pool group on espn com i the so called expert finished well beyond th stage guts whatever your interest or knowledge in college hoops there is no better baseline for your picks than instinctive "gut" reaction simply run through the match ups in one sitting and follow your first instinct thinking will only muddle your judgment in going through my picks below ive tried to be transparent about my

last year it was a rout  georgetown over texas a&amp m has the makings of a classic national title game florida over georgetown see my massive bracket busting caveat below at the end of "stage " stage second guessing this is where you go back over your "gut" picks and begin to question your judgment if you took a wild upset you wonder how you could have possibly picked against the chalk if you took a conservative approach you remind yourself that a upsets happen and the key to a great pool sheet is nabbing them and b a slate of safe picks rarely if ever wins the office pool heres my basic guideline the more confident you feel about a team going deep the more risk you can take in picking the teams they will beat along the way as long as the bold upset picks are going to end up losing eventually you wont sacrifice the big pool points of the final rounds on them plus keep in mind that youll be effectively out of your pool anyway if your picks for deep bracket runs are ousted early im not suggesting you take risks for the sake of taking risks although its a safe bet that all four no seeds wont make the final four but a pool sheet without upset picks isnt very much fun and historically not pool winningly accurate my biggest second guesses midwest what am i thinking with georgia tech inconsistency is never a quality in a tournament team you want to bank on if youre projecting three wins in a row  is butler this years gonzaga that top seeded mid major with a terrific rep due for a takedown particularly as the dreaded seed playing against a strong seed  can i admit to myself that i have not watched oregon nearly enough this year to know how good the ducks really are west vcu over duke vcu over duke vcu over duke this could be my pool buster on the very first day  koing kansas in the sweet arent they supposed to be this years florida  assuming ucla is final four worthy again didnt they lose ugly in the quarterfinal of their own conference tournament less than a week ago east how much of a problem is it that i have zero upsets in the first two rounds it just defies history  how much of a problem is it that im so bullish on texas which is obviously just a trendy pick  how much of a problem is it that im simply assuming georgetown is motivated enough from to win the region easily south wait how will texas a&amp m stop greg oden again  louisville could derail an a&amp m run to the final four in the first weekend  picking a over a is always iffy and what if uva makes a run stage reconciliation this is the moment when you combine your "gut" picks and second guessing and make tweaks substantial or superficial to your bracket this is the chance for me to back out of my pick of georgia tech to the elite eight or picking vcu over duke let alone to the regional finals or rethinking my plan to have texas upset unc or revisiting any lingering doubts that texas a&amp m isnt set up to make the leap to the final four nope second guessing has its value but im a big fan of the gut i might hesitate with a meaningless first round game here or there bc or texas tech does it matter if the winner will lose to georgetown the next game anyway vandy or gw same question illinois or va tech ditto but im all in with the most important picks my final four midwest florida over georgia tech west ucla over southern illinois east georgetown over texas south texas a&amp m over ohio state florida over ucla georgetown over texas a&amp m florida over georgetown worth noting of my game picks this is by far the most agonizing ive been saying since the season began that the only team in the field with a chance of beating the gators is the hoyas if only because georgetown played florida so close last march not only will the hoyas take the court against the gators without fear but they come with a chip on their shoulder the size of the washington monument as a florida fan this scares me if i werent a florida fan i would probably be taking georgetown but circling back to stage pre existing biases im blinded by fandom for better or worse stage resignation youve done the work these are your picks now transfer them to a clean bracket dont be a wuss in pen and turn in to your favorite office pool manager or submit your brackets online dont forget to save a copy for yourself to track results the lone lingering question if you enter multiple pools do you keep your same picks or do you spread the risk with different selections espn radios "mike and mike" popularized the phrase "bracket of integrity" to represent the former which i heartily endorse after all if youve done all this work to prepare your bracket for one pool or a dozen why not stand behind it dan shanoff blogs daily about sports at danshanoff com he is a former
