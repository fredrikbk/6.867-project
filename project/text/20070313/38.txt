energy is opec set to pump again officials say group will need to raise oil output soon opecs campaign to boost oil prices by constraining supply has worked as oil ministers meet this week signs are mounting that the group will soon have to begin pumping more crude ministers from the organization of petroleum exporting countries are scheduled to meet thursday in vienna to review oil output levels the cartel cut production at each of its last two meetings to reduce bloated inventories opecs ministers have made clear in public statements that they wont consider tightening supply further in vienna this week unless prices suddenly show signs of collapsing the omens industry officials said suggest opec will need to start increasing output in a few months to avoid choking the world economy opec members "have already reached their goal of wiping out a large part of excess inventories and stabilizing prices " said vera de ladoucette director of middle east research at cambridge energy research associates in paris a senior opec official said ministers will review the latest demand supply and inventory data including a monthly oil market report due to be published today by the paris based international energy agency the industrialized worlds energy watchdog "it looks like there will be no change" in output policy at this weeks meeting this official said the official cautioned against ruling out a surprise decision if fresh data suggest a need to cut analysts reckon opecs ministers are likely to wait until oil inventory data for the first few months of this year are published in coming months to confirm what the industry suspects that inventories are close to becoming so lean that the market is prone to a renewed price surge opec members have relished the four year boom in crude revenue which has put hundreds of billions of extra dollars in their coffers but they are anxious to avoid a recession inducing price climb if they conclude a cut is in order they have ways of ratcheting up supply quickly even before calling for a formal output increase saudi arabia opecs largest producer has done most of the cutting and could quietly start increasing shipments if buyers start asking for more oil industry analysts said or opec might meet again in a few months to consider formally doing away with some or all of the million barrels in cuts announced since october analysts generally estimate that opec actually has taken one million barrels a day or so of supply off the market after falling briefly to slightly less than &# a barrel in new york in january oil prices have bounced back to about &# a barrel oil futures fell &# or to &# yesterday on the new york mercantile exchange this has contributed to a rise in u s retail gasoline prices which this week stood at an average of about &# a gallon up cents from a month earlier according to the energy information administration oil prices peaked nominally at &# a barrel in new york in july though adjusted for inflation they were considerably higher in the early s worries about potential supply disruptions because of hurricanes the nuclear standoff with iran or political violence in the oil regions of nigeria drove the market last year prices began falling as the threat of supply outages faded as opec started tightening its spigots in the fall it also began building up unused pumping capacity that could be used to offset supply outages further easing supply concerns since opecs cuts inventories in consumer hands have been falling fast last month the iea reported that commercial stockpiles in its member countries in north america europe and asia fell by million barrels in the fourth quarter to billion barrels at the end of december that was just seven million barrels shy of opecs target of reducing the inventory overhang by some million barrels last week data from the u s energy department showed that inventories in the u s alone had fallen by more than million barrels since the start of october leo drollas deputy director of londons centre for global energy studies estimates that global inventories will have fallen nearly million barrels in the six months through the end of march "we havent seen a stock draw of this magnitude in several years " he said meanwhile "the big surprise this year could be strong demand for oil " said yasser elguindi senior managing director at medley global advisors a financial markets consultancy he estimates that the world might need as much as million barrels a day more oil than a year ago that is more than the million barrel a day growth in world demand to million barrels a day being projected by the iea "if opec is true to its word it has to turn from production cuts to production hikes " mr elguindi said noting the oil exporters success in whittling down inventories opecs ministers including saudi arabias influential ali naimi have repeatedly said they arent targeting a particular price level prices they assert lately have been influenced by financial market investors geopolitics and fears of supply disruptions last week exxon mobil corp chief executive rex tillerson said in an interview that concerns about the reliability of petroleum supply had resulted in a price premium "that premium seems to be in the &# to &# range " mr tillerson said oil analysts at barclays capital see the price of a barrel of oil moving up toward &# a barrel among the factors cited by barclays capital in a commentary was the growth in petroleum demand in the u s in february when compared with a year earlier that said barclays was the largest increase seen in any month for more than years at the same time many analysts are lowering expectations of growth in oil supply coming from countries that dont belong to opec suggesting the oil exporters group may have to make up the shortfall "there is a danger that they tighten oil markets too much " said mr drollas
