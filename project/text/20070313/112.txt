the game buyout shops sharks serving vital function control over liquidity makes them best hope for orphaned firms the buyout boom is taking on the air of a low budget miniseries with all the players tidily cast in roles of good or evil you know what hats the leveraged buyout shops wear theyve proven themselves congenital opportunists and arbitragers of ceos personal greed some members of the senate eager to don white hats are mucking about threatening to raise taxes on fees collected by the billionaire betes noires in the real world the role playing is more complex and much more interesting look at a situation like daimlerchrysler ag at the urging of shareholders the car company is desperately trying to unload its slumping chrysler business other auto makers are wearily going through the motions of a deal but daimlers best hope remains the private equity firms which have even deigned to step foot in detroit in february heres where the utility of the buyout shops however ruthless and unlovable begins to peek through its called liquidity and its a concept that anyone trying to sell an unloved home or concert ticket can acutely appreciate how much liquidity are we talking about private equity deals represented some of the overall m&amp a market last year the biggest in history at &# trillion according to thomson financial "the fact that theyre engaged and looking at chrysler is very positive " says jeffrey solomon managing member of ramius capital group an investment firm that has agitated against terms of some recent buyout deals "people dont wake up in the morning and cheer the private equity guys but the marketplace will have a different tenor when the money goes away " compare chryslers current position to the late s when the company came crawling to the u s government for a bailout a six month struggle ensued highlighted by senators play acting as investment bankers chrysler eventually secured a &# billion aid package in the days before christmas in or about &# billion in todays dollars such machinations are unnecessary today the private market is stepping into the breach with an additional &# billion of estimated spending power waiting in the wings wall street is underwriting the operations issuing cheap debt with lax lending terms and the u s tax code turns it all into a potent brew given that interest expenses on these debt heavy deals are tax deductible another case in point last years majority stake purchase of general motors finance arm by investment fund cerberus capital management which helped gm gather up sorely needed cash at the time of course shareholders and governments should be fiercely skeptical of how private money firepower is used particularly when managements are entwined in deals one need only look at englands drug retailer alliance boots plc which last week received a surprise &# billion offer from kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co the offer came with the cooperation of bootss own deputy chairman whos putting his own money into the deal the executive stefano pessina now is in the odd position of being at once buyer and seller such situations are almost comforting they seem to create an easily understandable cast of heroes and villains but sometimes its neither look at how rumors the past months have pushed up stock prices of dow chemical home depot and vivendi market valuations "might not be the same without the private equity markets " says steven n costabile who is in charge of investing money in private equity funds for aigs global investment group "the actual impact has not been dramatic" some of the overall market has been taken private he notes "but the perception of what private equity can do is extremely helpful " the rest of will be a crucial period for the likes of texas pacific group and kkr they are moving on ever larger targets and theyre meeting ever larger resistance the fight for utility txu corp for instance has already roused the otherwise snooze happy texas legislature a purchase of chrysler by the likes of blackstone group or cerberus might be an even more culturally explosive moment how will the private equity business approach the challenge inspiration comes from the th century statesman henry clay who professed a desire that hed "rather be right than be president " right now private equity wants to be both acknowledged for providing liquidity but also lauded for applying a hyper enlightened business savvy the buyout firms have established a trade group called the private equity council which will commission studies on private equity job creation innovation and the benefits of the members big business brains it remains to be seen how it will handle the politically charged issue of job cuts at target companies something private equity managers have also been known to engineer their case has so far taken on the tone of a finger wagging moralizer carlyle group co founder david rubenstein is trying to nudge the names "private equity" and "leveraged buyout" from the lexicon he prefers the term "change equity" to represent the corporate refurbishments that their quarry could never take while under public control one leading merger arbitrager isnt so convinced "what i find disingenuous is that they claim to be expert at managing companies you want to put on jimi hendrix and crowd it out by and large they are experts at managing capital structures " meaning willing to play with a companys debt profile rather than necessarily revamp its operations if only these firms would humbly remind us about the simple ways they serve the markets by buying orphaned companies that no one else will touch or by lubricating the economy at precisely the places where rust has set in such as at chrysler similarly shareholders would do well to remember how the street eventually demands humility they might eventually appreciate the value of this massive liquidity but that recognition might come only after its all dried up email dennis berman wsj com
