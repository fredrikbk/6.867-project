pension tension figuring out when to lump it more american workers are facing a critical question as they reach retirement whether to take pension benefits as a single one time cash payout or as a lifetime stream of monthly payments companies are increasingly giving retiring employees that choice and pension consultants say that most retirees take the lump sum when they can for many however a lump sum may not be the wisest choice people may spend down the money or invest it poorly and depending on their life expectancy they may well reap a greater benefit by opting for lifetime monthly payments historically pensions have been paid out as a fixed sum each month until the retiree dies with the option to take a reduced payment that continues for a spouses lifetime as well but today some of the million americans with a private sector pension have the lump sum option up from about in with more getting it every year over the past decade such companies as eastman chemical co cooper tire &amp rubber co and citigroup inc have added the option as in many cases they switch to "cash balance" or other cost saving plans last years sweeping pension legislation may further complicate the lump sum calculation for some retirees it allows employers with cash balance pension plans in which workers accumulate a hypothetical account balance based on their annual pay to use the account value when calculating a lump sum payout instead of recalculating it using average life expectancies as was previously required it could lead to a bigger difference in the value of the traditional and lump sum options if your financial adviser encourages you to take a lump sum be wary "they stand to make a substantial amount of money" earning commissions or fees on the assets you invest says gary schatsky a financial adviser in new york who also receives fees on lump sums he invests for clients financial advisers may also be unaware of other reasons why lump sums may be a bad deal here are five more things to consider before taking a lump sum your companys health may not matter as much as you think many people think a lump sum is safer thanks to all the bad news in the pension world that includes ailing airlines that have dumped pensions onto the pension benefit guaranty corp leaving pilots with a fraction of the retirement income they were entitled to but the federal pension insurer guarantees payouts up to &# a year at age so only retirees who are eligible for bigger pensions would lose out if their company goes under the guarantee is lower for those retiring before taking a lump sum may make sense if your company is teetering on bankruptcy and youre expecting a large pension but most companies and people arent in this situation your own health may matter a lot in a nutshell if youre in poor health it may be advisable to take the lump sum if you have a choice but if you expect to live a long time the lifetime payments are probably a better deal heres why the monthly checks retirees traditionally receive from a pension called an annuity are typically based on each retirees pay and years of work but when employers pay out lump sums they must convert the future monthly payments into a cash out value to do this they estimate how many years of checks the person is likely to receive using national average life expectancies which were last updated in so if you have a chronic disease or a family history of early deaths from heart attacks or for some reason you dont think youll outlive the national average you may be better off taking a lump sum but if you expect to live longer than average you may be shortchanging yourself "most people greatly underestimate what their life expectancy is " says heidi rackley an actuary at mercer human resources consulting a man turning in can expect to live an additional years on average recent industry estimates suggest while a woman is likely to live more years "a key thing people forget about average life expectancy is that half the population will live longer than that " ms rackley says companies understand this dynamic well blue collar workers tend to have shorter life spans than the national average and companies with mostly blue collar workers are less likely to offer lump sums by offering only monthly checks until the employees death the company ends up paying out less in total pensions general motors corp for instance doesnt allow most of its workers to take a lump sum payout employers with mostly white collar and female workers those most likely to live longer than average are most likely to offer lump sums international business machines corp is one gm allows its white collar workers to take a lump sum if they leave before retirement age companies including gm and ibm say mortality factors dont play a role in their decision about offering lump sums but government data show a strong correlation between longevity and payout options about of blue collar workers had a lump sum option in their pension plans while of white collar workers did according to a bureau of labor statistics report keep in mind the age and health of your spouse and any dependents married couples may also be better off taking the monthly payments by law married retirees may take monthly checks over their lifetime with nothing for a surviving spouse or instead opt for a smaller monthly check that will continue to be paid as long as a surviving spouse lives the size of the reduced check is determined largely by the spouses age life expectancy for couples can be longer than for individuals ms rackley cautions "theres a good chance one of them is going to live to " bedda and paul dangelo each opted for monthly payments from their previous employers figuring theyd end up with more money in the long run in fact ms dangelo now a financial adviser in durham n c says she often advises clients to avoid taking a lump sum "i have always preferred to bet that people are going to live than that they are going to die" early ms dangelo says other factors can complicate the decision however albert van lund who retired as head of human resources for a california utility company seemed a shoo in for taking monthly payments he and his wife were in good health and his father had lived to he took a lump sum instead now mr van lund says he preferred investing the money himself and wanted to provide for his disabled son the monthly payments would have ended once he and his wife died retiring early can cost you of your pension or more in a bid to encourage older workers to retire many large companies offer an early retirement subsidy effectively paying out a full pension as much as a decade before normal retirement age but the law doesnt require employers to take these subsidies into account when converting a monthly benefit into a lump sum that alone can cost retirees of the value of their pensions or more with longtime workers in their s to mid s losing the most while employers are required by law to show workers what they would lose by taking a lump sum retirement experts say their information isnt always clear and retirees dont always realize whats at stake know the quirks of your pension plan some pension plans have rules that help them win the payout roulette consider the multi employer pension plan sponsored by the marine engineers beneficial association which covers ship engineers and deck officers it requires workers to meet health standards and potentially submit to a medical exam before being eligible for a lump sum retirees in good health can take a lump sum but those in poor health may not be allowed to according to participants plan documents and former plan officials current plan officials didnt return calls seeking comment the provision saves the plan money because those most likely to die early will receive only a few years worth of pension checks instead of a more valuable lump sum those likely to live a long time but who take the lump sum based on average life expectancy end up getting less than they would have with monthly checks the pension plan wins either way less healthy participants in the meba plan have an out by requesting a lump sum at least two years before retiring they may take it regardless of their health several plan participants said they and co workers try to make sure to ask for the lump sum in advance corrections &amp amplifications new york financial adviser gary schatsky charges flat or hourly fees for his services not fees that are based on a percentage of his clients investments a march personal journal article on lump sum pension payments failed to make clear the distinction wsj march
