cleaning out a liquor cabinet the problem a liquor cabinet full of dusty half empty bottles the solution know whats past its prime and toss it out bottles less than a quarter full will have lost a significant amount of alcohol so they should be weeded out any liquor made with fruit or cream such as baileys irish cream should be discarded within six months of opening beer thats been around the house for more than two months loses much of its taste and is a candidate for the garbage bin although beers with a high alcohol content such as stouts will keep longer unopened water bottles that have been exposed to sunlight may taste bad since the exposure allows gases to pass from the plastic into the water opened water bottles are incubators for algae or bacteria after seven days if in doubt throw it out alcohol is a preservative so distilled liquors such as vodka gin rum and whiskey should be fine for years or more
