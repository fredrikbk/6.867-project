as a superhero the captain changed along with america last wednesday morning while most people kibitzed about scooter libby over their morning coffee captain america was murdered on the steps of the federal courthouse in new york captain america real life identity steve rogers is survived by his crime fighting partner bucky and his girlfriend sharon carter who may have fired the fatal shots while under the control of the evil dr faustus such are the perils of romance the death of captain america became quite improbably a minor cultural event according to joe quesada the editor in chief of marvel comics marvel made the decision to kill cap months ago while it was plotting the direction of its seven issue limited series "civil war " which details the rift between heroes following a law that required superheroes to register with the government marvel kept the decision to kill cap secret the final issue of "civil war" was released in february and last week issue of "captain america" arrived on the doorsteps of the nations comic book shops owners unpacking the boxes of new inventory were shocked to find cap lying dead in a hospital on the final page there was a flurry of chatter on the internet within hours the wire services picked up the story and people crowded into neighborhood comic book shops by noon the issue was sold out and fetching hefty sums on ebay there is an old joke about death in the comic book world no one stays dead except bucky jason todd and uncle ben over the years superman phoenix green arrow and a legion of other heroes have perished only to be resurrected by their publishers in reasonably short order even this bucky clause of hero death has begun unraveling as both bucky and jason todd who replaced dick grayson as robin were recently brought back to life this was in fact the second time captain america journeyed to the undiscovered country cap was born in march when a scrawny steve rogers tried to enlist in the army rejected because of his feeble physique rogers volunteered for a secret government program attempting to create a super soldier through genetic enhancement alas just as all robots eventually rebel and kill their masters all government attempts at genetic manipulation are doomed to go awry the scientist heading the super soldier program ended up dead but steve rogers became a specimen of physical perfection with heightened reflexes and enhanced strength the army sent him into battle with a red white and blue shield and the moniker captain america the cover of the first issue of captain america showed cap socking hitler with a right cross nearly a year before america declared war on germany a champion of american freedom caps popularity soared during world war ii as he battled nazis and the japanese with bucky at his side after the war sales of captain america dwindled the title was canceled in as bradford wright details in "comic book nation " marvel brought cap back several years later as a cold warrior "captain america commie smasher " this time he and bucky fought communist agents "who hid behind the privileges of a free society in order to subvert american institutions " the series sold poorly and was dropped after a few issues captain america changed with the times he returned in and found renewed fame but not as the same rock jawed stalwart soldier in he was paired with the first african american superhero the falcon in one small sign of how comics were evolving the falcons alter ego sam wilson was a harlem social worker as vietnam raged captain america stayed home in marvels stan lee wrote that cap "simply doesnt lend himself to the john wayne type character he once was" and that he "could not see any of marvels characters taking on the role of super patriotism in the world as it is today " instead cap became a great society superhero battling as mr wright puts it "poverty racism pollution and political corruption " consider this monologue from a s issue in which cap muses "im like a dinosaur in the cro magnon age an anachronism whos out lived his time this is the day of the anti hero the age of the rebel and the dissenter it isnt hip to defend the establishment only to tear it down and in a world rife with injustice greed and endless war whos to say the rebels are wrong ive spent a lifetime defending the flag and the law perhaps i should have battled less and questioned more " while he avoided vietnam captain america dove head on into watergate he took up arms against a thinly veiled version of the nixon white house which was linked to a mccarthyite conservative political group called the committee to regain americas principles or "crap " but this creep knock off wasnt merely attempting to re elect the president using dirty tricks instead crap was a front for a cabal of actual fascists who were plotting to take over the country the leader of the conspiracy was naturally the president after being duped by the president cap dropped his hero name and became briefly "nomad the man without a country " given his political progress it is not surprising that by the time "civil war" began cap was quoting thomas paine and couching his opposition to the superhero registration act in terms of civil liberties marvel now seems poised to use his death as the focus of a large scale debate on the balancing of freedom and security "captain america" will probably return ed brubaker the current writer of the series wont divulge details but comments in an interview with the web site comic book resources "ive got the next two years of cap plotted if that says anything " fans have already concocted several plausible resurrection scenarios but before looking toward his next incarnation its worth pausing to appreciate that even at this late date captain americas death still meant something partially this was due to the simple fact that marvel was able to keep his murder a surprise something of a wonder in an age when every other happening comes prehyped and presold mr quesada reveals that the editors went to great lengths to keep the secret engaging in a quiet campaign of disinformation and even going so far as to leak fake covers to throw fans off the scent ultimately it is wonder that we need most from comic books the wonder that a man can fly or that a skinny american kid with a stout heart can pick up a shield and deck the fuhrer with his death last week captain america gave us that sense of wonder once more mr last is online editor of the weekly standard
