a cultural conversation with billy mccomiskey this irish american musician isnt boxed in by his accordion back when he was mayor of baltimore marylands current governor martin omalley fired billy mccomiskey the all ireland senior champion of the button accordion as opposed to the piano key accordion and one of americas most accomplished irish traditional performers lead singer guitarist and songwriter for omalleys march his own irish fusion band mr omalley asked mr mccomiskey at a get together five years ago if he could substitute for an ailing member of omalleys march at three performances "i told him i could do only one and that hed have to get someone else for the other two " recalled the year old button accordionist from his home in parkville a baltimore suburb "then a session an irish music jam started downstairs and my son sean got out his button accordion and played later as martin was leaving he turned to me and said by the way youre fired i asked what do you mean and he said if its ok with you i decided to hire your son for all three gigs " reached in annapolis gov omalley said of the father "billy has been a great force for passing traditional irish music on to the next generation and is a continuing source of pride to all traditional players in baltimore and maryland " maryland is mr mccomiskeys adoptive state born in brooklyn to a father from armagh and an american mother whose own parents hailed from tipperary and limerick he was surrounded by irish traditional music at home and began teaching himself the button accordion at age nine "the great thing about accordions is that theyre the peoples instrument " he said "you dont have to be some kind of genius to play it " during a weekend in new yorks catskill mountains however year old billy discovered he was shortchanging the instruments capabilities after watching two irish virtuosos perform in the same session joe cooley and bobby gardiner "irish accordion players are always dealing with the limitations of their instruments and trying to make them fit irish music " mr mccomiskey explained "its part of the illusion created by great playing how to seem to do something at times you couldnt really do and that takes exceptional skill and imagination so when i saw cooley play the accordion that weekend i recognized how great his music was then at one oclock in the morning gardiner walked in and tore the house down his box playing has never left me "when i finally got up the courage to play for them i was mortified that i couldnt because of a hole in my bellows but cooley told me i know you can play then he placed his hand on my shoulder it was just the support i needed " more crucial support came from sean mcglynn a button accordionist from galway who was years older than mccomiskey and lived in queens and later in long island "when i was a high school sophomore i completely messed up this arpeggio in a tune called the pride of lisdoonvarna " mr mccomiskey said "sean played a tune or two to show me how and then he played for another half hour i was so confused that i actually went upstairs to do homework he popped up to my room and said dont worry youre going to be a great player we became the best of friends after that " in remembering mcglynns tragic death on jan mr mccomiskey grows quiet on that bitterly cold day mcglynn had driven his minivan to jamaica queens so he could take the subway into manhattan he was found slumped on the minivans steering wheel shot through the right hand and heart this unsolved murder devastated mccomiskey "sean never once denied me anything musical " he said "his approach to irish accordion music was perfect he was selfless " in honor of his late friend mr mccomiskey plays the gray two row paolo soprani button accordion owned by mcglynn proof of mcglynns accordion brilliance can be heard in the "odonnells spellan the fiddler" hornpipes and "johnny allens sporting nell" reels that he recorded with mr mccomiskey on "makin the rounds " the latters superb solo debut in by then mr mccomiskey had been living in the washington baltimore region for six years he had left new york for the nations capital to form a trio called the irish tradition with singer guitarist andy obrien and fiddler brendan mulvihill wearing jeans flannel shirts and long hair the trio were the sartorial and attitudinal antithesis of matching blazer irish showbands and aran sweater clones of the clancy brothers on stage the irish tradition eschewed jokes and other banter to concentrate on the music and audiences reveled in it staunchly irish traditional jigs reels and hornpipes were played with power snap and invention and woven among them was mr obriens expressive singing of irish traditional and other folk songs "the d c bars we played in werent like the new york bars i played in " mr mccomiskey said "we were getting attention from the washington post and other newspapers and people from the smithsonian would drop in to listen where irish traditional music started to reach out into america i think was in d c more than in new york " the irish tradition released three albums "catchin the tune" "the corner house" their finest recording and an overlooked irish american classic and "the times weve had" after a decade long run the trio called it quits "we didnt know how to take the next step into doing concerts and tours " mr mccomiskey said "i was also getting tired of the wild nights of music in d c " mr mccomiskey went to trade school to learn air conditioning repair and maintenance "i entered the exciting world of climate control " he said with a chuckle "ive been a maintenance mechanic for years in nearby towson a friend of my wife calls me a musician with a full time job on the side " married since billy and annie mccomiskey have three sons patrick sean and michael all can play irish music and sean performs with marylands governor on the next cd by omalleys march "i never felt i was receding or retreating from the irish music scene " mr mccomiskey said of the years following the irish tradition "i just started to play more in sessions in baltimore which had this exquisite irish music all its own " in he also competed in and won the all ireland senior button accordion championship "standing by the door of the hall and smiling encouragement at me was bobby gardiner " he said in liz carroll the all ireland senior fiddle champion asked mr mccomiskey to record with her and singer guitarist daithi sproule calling themselves trian irish for "third" they
