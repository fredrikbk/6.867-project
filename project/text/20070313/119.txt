the insiders how five new players aid movement to limit ceo pay mainstream figures mix with activists a fix from within meredith miller a low key state official with a lot of clout is helping rev up the movement to limit executive pay charged with helping protect connecticuts &# billion public employee pension fund she recently prodded financial powerhouses such as morgan stanley into making changes to their compensation practices ms miller years old is part of an unusual new movement that has turned executive pay activism into a potent mainstream force and not just the redoubt of gadflies it now counts as members academics mutual fund trustees foreign institutional investors union leaders and politicians last year mutual fund companies withheld votes to re elect directors at pfizer inc and home depot inc whose chief executives enjoyed big pay packages despite their companies poor share performance both have since resigned this year through march investors had submitted shareholder proposals related to executive pay almost double the year earlier period according to proxy adviser institutional shareholder services rep barney frank meanwhile held a hearing last week on a bill that would require companies to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay deals mr frank chairman of the house financial services committee and a massachusetts democrat previously introduced legislation to give shareholders a veto he says he made the change to gain congressional republican support and improve the chances that president bush will sign the bill "heck even the president says theres a problem " says mr frank referring to a speech given by president bush in january urging boards to guard against oversized ceo paychecks these activists sometimes form loose networks to share strategies and lobby for each others causes a few are uncomfortable with the "activist" label john a hill chairman of the board of trustees at mutual fund giant putnam funds says he joined the debate partly because he didnt "want to cede the terrain" to traditional activists with little business background some are driven by professional motives others by political ones uniting them all is distaste for large exit packages given to ousted chief executives and recent revelations about rigged stock options executives who collect sky high pay despite poor corporate performance are a particular target unlike the public grandstanding common to some activists in the past this crowd prefers to work behind the scenes often through persuasion rather than confrontation recent regulatory changes reflect the movements clout and have also helped stoke its fires under new federal disclosure rules companies have to give investors more information about executive pay perks and retirement benefits in their proxy statements the tallies which are slowly being released could be eye popping its hard to say whether the new activism will curb pay past efforts have fallen short sometimes because companies found new ways to compensate executives and sometimes because regulations had the perverse effect of pushing pay higher mark reilly a partner at c compensation consulting consortium estimates that under the new disclosure rules nearly half of the biggest public companies will reveal ceo pay packages of around &# million including compensation stock option exercises and accumulated pension benefits here are five people who represent the new mainstream activism the networker in late berkeley calif lawyer jesse brill received an email from a compensation consultant urging directors to "tally up" what they would owe a departing ceo the message followed dick grassos resignation as ceo of the new york stock exchange amid a furor over his &# million compensation package mr brill who has been publishing newsletters about corporate law since the s seized the idea he suggested directors include current and future compensation and dubbed the result a "tally sheet " then he aggressively promoted the notion to the readers of his newsletters and web sites who include corporate lawyers pay consultants and directors mr brill says he didnt want to retire without addressing the issue of soaring executive pay he made little headway at first "people thought it was jesses little fixation " says john olson a senior partner at law firm gibson dunn &amp crutcher llp who advises corporate boards after mr olson saw support for the idea grow he urged a board he was advising to develop a tally sheet mr olson wont name the company directors were shocked at the numbers they trimmed the amounts executives would receive if the company changed hands and cut perks recalls mr olson compensation consultant pearl meyer says mr brill prompted her to add pension benefits and perks to the pay summaries she presents to clients in october mr brill hosted a conference whose speakers included alan beller then an attorney for the securities and exchange commission who had begun drafting new rules to expand disclosure of executive compensation when those rules were issued last year they required companies to list executives"total compensation" a concept similar to mr brills tally sheet mr beller says mr brill was "one of the people who was influential in our thinking" about compensation mr brill talks and emails constantly with compensation consultants and corporate lawyers before publicizing the good ideas and the pitfalls these days hes advocating an analysis that would help trim the pay gap between the ceo and other executives starbucks corp and mdu resources group inc an energy and construction company discussed the idea for the first time in their proxies "i dont view myself as being one of the reformers " says mr brill "i want to fix the system from within " the professor harvard law school professor lucian bebchuk is one of the intellectual engines of the pay restraint movement producing studies arguing that weak boards are paying executives without regard to company performance mr frank has cited mr bebchuks research showing executives claiming a growing share of corporate profits sec commissioner roel campos says mr bebchuks pension research was "very influential" in crafting the new disclosure rules in mr bebchuk who holds doctorates in both law and economics began working on compensation issues using as a base his previous work on boards lack of accountability during takeovers in he co wrote a book "pay without performance " which criticized boards for offering ceos sizable pay deals "i view the problem of executive pay as being partly the product of excessive insulation of boards from shareholders and the weakness of shareholder rights " says the polish born israeli raised academic whose gold rimmed glasses perch halfway down his nose mr bebchuk is playing a pivotal role in promoting a tactic for curbing compensation revising corporate bylaws the rules that govern companies internal affairs last year he submitted amendments at two companies including home depot that would have required more disclosure about pensions each received more than of votes cast a significant tally albeit a losing one this year he proposed bylaws at four companies to require that ceo compensation packages be approved by at least two thirds of independent directors home depots board adopted his proposal jan two days after ceo robert nardelli resigned amid complaints about his pay a spokesman calls the change "a reasonable extension" of home depots prior policy some corporate advisers arent sold theodore mervis a partner at wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz in new york calls mr bebchuk "the elvis presley of executive compensation " a reference to the academics fondness for the media spotlight bylaw amendments "create legal gobbledygook without understanding the underlying issue " mr mervis contends the bureaucrat ms miller is an assistant treasurer for the state of connecticut in october she drafted a letter to large companies seeking information about whether compensation consultants hired by the board had conflicts of interest activists worry that a consulting company wont give the board impartial advice on pay packages if the firm is also advising executives the new sec disclosure rules dont address such conflicts the letter was signed by other big pension funds including those of several unions representing in total about &# billion in assets as a result morgan stanley directors dropped hewitt associates inc as their compensation consultant because hewitt also advised the banks management about pensions a morgan stanley spokesman calls the letter the "primary reason" for the change morgan stanleys board says it will choose a new consultant with no ties to the firm hewitt declines to comment ms miller later sent to the same companies responses from the who she thought had the best practices at wachovia corp directors already had a policy to use independent pay consultants but ruth g shaw chairman of the banks compensation committee expects the panel to put the policy in writing after ms miller highlighted other boards that do so "my hat is off to meredith miller " ms shaw says "she is having some real impact here " ms miller says she has drawn on mr bebchuks writing about potential conflicts she traces her interest in shareholder activism to the late s when as a cornell university graduate student she heard a campus speaker suggest that unions invest solely in pro labor businesses she worked for organized labor and gave her daughter a middle name of "debs " after union leader eugene v debs in connecticut treasurer denise nappier hired ms miller then a clinton administration pension official to spearhead corporate governance advocacy for the state pension fund she recalls that her "heart was racing" when she addressed the annual meeting of office depot inc in she urged shareholders to recommend the company adopt tighter ties between compensation and performance the measure won just of voting shares shortly before a vote on a similar proposal office depot revamped its practices to include performance based stock options among other things the change "wasnt a response to connecticut " says david fannin the retailers general counsel the mutual fund trustee one line in bank of america corp s proxy statement galvanized putnams mr hill to action on executive pay the bank said it paid ceo kenneth lewis about &# million in part as a reward for the "success" of its recent merger with fleetboston financial corp mr hill who has been a putnam trustee since was skeptical "im in the buyout business " says mr hill vice chairman of first reserve corp greenwich conn "you dont know whether somethings going to be good for several years " putnams trustees protested mr lewiss pay package by withholding votes to re elect him to bank of americas board in bank of america declines to comment mr hill and the putnam trustees who oversee the firms &# billion in mutual fund assets represent an important new voice for restraint in executive pay big institutional investors have traditionally sided with management on governance and pay issues and tended to sell shares rather than protest if they disagreed in mutual fund companies surveyed by governance tracker corporate library supported on average of management resolutions and of management backed director candidates mr hill a former federal energy official and avid big game fisher says putnam became more assertive following the collapse of enron corp suddenly it was clear the governance issues in particular ensuring that directors were independent and watchful had become a subject of vital importance for investors last year putnam was among the firms that withheld their votes to re elect directors at pfizer and home depot mr hill followed up with personal letters to the ceos "you have been paid exceedingly generous cash and equity compensation" despite home depots declining share price mr hill wrote to then ceo nardelli in june last year mr nardelli telephoned mr hill recalls the putnam trustee saying he didnt agree with mr hills views but was sure the compensation committee would "consider" them "i hope so " mr hill recalls saying "because i dont want to be writing you this letter again next year " a lawyer for mr nardelli didnt respond to requests for comment the union leader in edward durkin an official of the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners rose to speak at the annual meeting of archer daniels midland co then ceo dwayne andreas cut him off banging the gavel and yelling "this is my company my meeting " recalls mr durkin these days mr durkin who oversees governance issues for the unions pension fund says hes more effective when lobbying corporate executives in private he spends hours on the phone discussing the minutiae of pay plans and exploring compromises mr durkin often withdraws shareholder resolutions the union has backed when companies agree to make changes or even to talk he calls the process "mind numbing and labor intensive " but necessary to enhance the value of the unions &# billion pension fund "compensation is clearly the most demanding and frustrating area of advocacy " he says the union is currently pursuing shareholder proposals relating to executive compensation at companies including johnson &amp johnson and yahoo inc mr durkin has used similar tactics in past campaigns in and the union won roughly shareholder votes urging companies to treat stock options as an expense mr durkin then pushed to give shareholders a bigger voice in electing directors by bringing together representatives of companies and three other unions intel corp a participant in the talks adopted a rule requiring director nominees to win a majority of votes to be elected typically directors can be elected by a plurality this year the carpenters union withdrew a shareholder proposal at american express co after the company said it would reduce executive retirement benefits mr durkin also withdrew a resolution at norfolk southern corp after ceo charles w moorman called and promised to discuss the railroads retirement benefits policy mr durkin is a third generation union leader whose grandfather a steamfitter served briefly as labor secretary under dwight d eisenhower a summer job doing electrical work convinced mr durkin his talents "lay elsewhere " he got a law degree and joined the carpenters union in jumping into shareholder activism soon after mr durkin says he hopes to ease the "hand to hand combat" of negotiating separately with each company last year he suggested that his union and the u s chamber of commerce co sponsor a study group on executive pay the group met for the first time in late february with six companies and five unions represented mr durkin is "a thoughtful guy " says david chavern the chambers chief operating officer
