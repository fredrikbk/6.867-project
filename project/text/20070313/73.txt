no day at the beach but even paradise lost can beat a desk job earl crews has a monkey on his back at work but its just that an orphaned spider monkey named winky who hangs from his gray hair and has a tendency to doze off in the middle of his presentations as the co founder with his wife carol of an animal sanctuary the year old is describing to visitors how grumpy toucans can be seemingly affable theyre untrustworthy backstabbers whod eat your young "theres nothing nice you can say about them " mr crews says as if everyone hasnt worked with someone like that in the rainforest of costa rica the couple realized one of the few universal fantasies of a nonsexual nature fleeing corporate culture the crewses both once independent lumber traders now rescue monkeys and macaws at their osa wildlife sanctuary foundation on the black sand shores of the golfo dulce but a day at the beach isnt always a day at the beach paradise is itchy and among the animals they nurse for release back into the wild theres plenty of office echoes territorialism bottle feeding ankle biting the lightning theft of unguarded lunches and most reminiscent a lack of adequate socialization the office isnt a civilized departure from the jungle its a re enactment in the lumber industry mrs crews used to hear comments like "i wasnt expecting a broad in the boards " and mr crews recalls one bumper sticker in a mill office "i like spotted owls fried " there were sloths in that former job too only those laurel resters smoked cigars referring to a two toed sloth he says "rhonda smells better " the steady ravages of business induced stress working hour weeks with their own money on the line left mr crews "absolutely burned out " he says "i could literally lose my house overnight " in costa rica he did lose it when the couple was renovating a cabin a pair of opportunistic scarlet macaws ramona and april seized it because the birds have the bite of a german shepherd the couple moved to another cabin rather than risk it the macaws will clip an adversarys wings to keep it from flying sound familiar "when i go in and check on something " mr crews says "two people will go with me with gardening rakes " the couples transition into animal rescue was accidental happening after they had decided to leave the lumber trade to open a bed and breakfast they sold their house near san francisco and moved to cana blanca where they had found a acre parcel within a year they opened an inn with three airy cabins when an employee gave them a red lored parrot named chico they refused to clip its wings developing reputations "as crazy gringos who let their birds fly around " mr crews says locals started giving them other birds and so a new career began the crewses dont draw a salary instead paying their employees with revenue from sanctuary tours they keep their own expenses cellular and internet services and the same scrambled eggs and fruit the animals eat low enough to be covered by donations they rescued and released birds for seven years then came the mammals four years ago when government officials seized papi a young spider monkey from a poacher and gave her to the couple rather than to an overcrowded zoo she stirs up trouble freeing other animals prematurely "shed make a great shop steward " mrs crews says papi is also complicit in nepotism mrs crews is high in the monkeys social circles thats good news for mr crews whose association with his wife means papi spares him the fanny biting she reserves for rivals even here mrs crews notes "its who you know " so much for escaping the office sweet pea another spider monkey steals other peoples food and water bottles guapo a former abused pet suffers mood swings that once led him to rip a toilet from the floor and the nocturnal marta a kinkajou just sleeps all day but she is held dear because of her eager to please attitude not unlike some administrative assistants mrs crews says humans dont get to sleep late in paradise mr crewss day begins at a m he and the sanctuarys six workers prepare vast quantities of food lead animal rehab exercises conduct tours dole out care and maintain cages and cabins the work day ends at p m they keep the white faced capuchin monkeys cages strewn with fisher price toys because anything less stimulating doesnt satisfy them its an age old managerial challenge "you have to keep them interested " mr crews says the hardest task is coping with sluggish government bureaucracies and strict requirements for handling wildlife from having a permit for every bird to monthly inspections the couple must develop release protocols for each of species and meet rigid international standards for endangered species still in his old job "the only reward was money " and there was little fun mr crews says despite the grind the reverse is true in costa rica "if i had a bad conscience in my life as a trader i bought and sold enough lumber to cut down several forests this is my way of giving back " he says email me at jared sandberg wsj com to see past columns please go to careerjournal com
