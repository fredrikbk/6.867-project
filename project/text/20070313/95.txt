seafaring scientist sees rich promise in tiny organisms marine microbes are among the most abundant life form on the planet and among the most mysterious now results from the first phase of a global expedition are expected to provide a glimpse into this long hidden world while potentially leading to new drugs and even fighting climate change craig venter the brash biologist who helped crack the human genome seven years ago says he and other scientists have used dna analysis techniques to discover millions of new genes and thousands of new proteins in ocean microbes these microscopic life forms are mainly bacteria and organisms known as archaea "everything weve seen is a surprise " mr venter said in a phone interview from his marine research vessel sorcerer ii in the sea of cortez the unexpected variety of microbial dna hes found overturns earlier notions that the oceans are a homogenous soup of bacteria and other microscopic life the details are being published today in the public library of science biology an internet based scientific journal a diverse supply of microbial dna from the oceans could be a rich lode for scientists drug companies are hunting for new compounds in sea creatures especially to attack cancer and neurodegenerative diseases the new data will also allow researchers to compare the dna of oceanic bacteria to the genetic code of microorganisms that cause human disease "this is the largest dna sequence ever obtained and the magnitude of whats being done is entirely unparalleled " said douglas bartlett professor of marine microbiology at the university of california san diego who isnt involved in dr venters project marine microbes "have all kind of metabolic activity it is expected that dr venters team will discover new pathways for making drugs and treating infectious disease " dr venter one of the more savvy scientists when it comes to publicity likens his project to charles darwins th century voyage on the beagle the journey is also modeled on one of the first oceanographic expeditions by the british sailing ship challenger in the s which sought to determine whether there was life in the ocean depths the findings filled volumes each as thick as a family bible similarly the data from the first phase of the sorcerer expedition is expected to be the largest such troves of genetic information released in the public domain the ocean project "is adding new genes to our tool kit " said dr venter years old "they are key to the next phase of biology the synthetic phase " dr venter is betting the findings could also pave the way to alternative energy by adding genes from sea organisms he speculates microbes created in the lab may be engineered to release hydrogen an alternative fuel another idea would be for such microbes to absorb excess carbon dioxide and reduce the impact of climate change in labs run by the j craig venter institute in rockville md one such experiment is already under way an attempt to alter the process of photosynthesis and produce hydrogen gas the target is hydrogenase a small bacterial protein system that produces hydrogen and is also highly sensitive to oxygen dr venter says his team found a hydrogenase by sequencing the genes of microbes fished from the sargasso sea and it is far less sensitive to the presence of oxygen his team hopes to make a microbe with a synthetic version of that gene and thereby produce hydrogen gas in room air which is about oxygen the sorcerer ii expedition started with a pilot project in in the sargasso sea near bermuda in an area believed to have little microbial diversity the team discovered a million new genes and new species of bacteria the project then became more ambitious seeking to obtain microbial dna from the worlds oceans in a two year circumnavigation that cost &# million ending in december it then continued sampling waters of the northern hemisphere the u s department of energy and the gordon and betty moore foundation funded the sequencing and analysis while the venter institute funded operation of the sorcerer the team obtains samples with two gallon buckets every miles or so the water is passed through four sets of filters and the remaining microorganisms are sent to the maryland labs where their dna codes are sequenced unexpected problems cropped up during the expedition the research falls under the jurisdiction of a united nations convention on biological diversity which requires the venter team to obtain permission from countries before obtaining microorganisms from territorial waters even though the invisible ocean going microbes know no boundaries they are deemed to be the "genetic patrimony" of that particular country one dispute over who had such rights resulted in dr venters team being placed under temporary "house arrest" in french polynesia dr venter says in the late s dr venter through his company celera genomics launched a private effort to sequence the human genome famously challenging a rival effort financed by the u s government and concluding in a history making tie his idea to sell tools and resources related to the genomic database for a fee never took off dr venter was fired by celera in early over squabbles with the board about the companys direction he then embarked on a bid to create artificial life forms in the lab and plan the sorcerer trip data will be available via a massive online publicly accessible database funded by a seven year &# million grant dr venter said
