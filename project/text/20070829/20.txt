casino brings vegas to macau venetian is geared toward tastes of chinese visitors macau the venetian resort and casino that opened here yesterday offers the same faux canals and italian gondoliers that american visitors can find in the las vegas original but the chinese touches at the opening ceremony made it clear that this &# billion venetian was built for a very different audience cast members of cirque du soleil which will open a permanent show here next year spun in hula hoops in front of giant chinese coins while acrobats joined hands to form the number eight auspicious in chinese culture when diana ross took the stage she was joined in a rendition of "endless love" by cantonese pop singer alan tam las vegas sands corp is hoping that the venetian will help it transform macau into a vegas for asia where visitors from the region especially china can indulge their penchant for gambling and cultivate western tastes for shopping and entertainment for visitors already familiar with the original exploring the chinese elements in this new incarnation is half of the fun of visiting the macau venetian takes the vegas simulation of an italian city and then scales everything to chinese size and taste here there are three indoor canals instead of one where chinese sampans will eventually float alongside the gondolas the hotel rooms feature both italian oil paintings and chinese wooden screens the casino floor which at square feet is the worlds largest is split into sections named red dragon gold fish phoenix and imperial house "im really impressed with how theyve done it " says suey lam a year old originally from manchester england who took the trip from nearby hong kong just for the opening "but it is overwhelming because it is so big " shes glad she heeded a warning from organizers and wore comfortable shoes just getting around the giant complex which the company says is the biggest casino in the world and the biggest building in asia was an endeavor champagne colored carpets and off white chandeliers give the venetian macau a sense of style but the sameness of the color scheme also makes it hard to keep track of where you are when a hostess at one bar couldnt tell ms lam how to get to the shopping mall she turned to three different las vegas sands executives standing nearby for directions they couldnt help either eventually a building engineer escorted her up a giant circular staircase to the shops that sit along a re creation of venices st marks square if many of the staff inside the venue were a bit confused about what was where yesterday it may be because the site was under construction until the last minute outside the resort the area around the venetian called the cotai strip remains a giant construction zone for some time views from many of the windows in the venetians otherwise plush rooms will be of construction cranes most long haul travelers can make their way to macau by flying into nearby hong kong and then taking a &# one hour ferry to macau the venetian was until recently offering many of its all suite rooms for just &# on weekdays through the end of the year though thats now bumped up to &# gambling has been a major pastime for decades in macau a set of islands and a peninsula on the southern china coast ruled by portuguese administrators until but it was in that growth here took off after the government invited foreign casino operators to set up shop already the territorys gambling revenue has surpassed that of the las vegas strip the operators of the venetian along with similar vegas imports from wynn and mgm say theyre trying to change macau instead of just hard core mostly male gamblers theyre hoping to appeal to vacationers families and conference goers "entertainment is something that everybody in the world enjoys and there has never been such an entertainment center in the history of asia " sheldon adelson las vegas sands chief executive said yesterday "we have spent billions of dollars because we are certain demand will be there " to meet that demand las vegas sands supersized this venetian orifeo a gondolier originally from sorrento italy who had been singing and rowing at the las vegas venetian says macaus canals are much more impressive "the american one looks like a swimming pool compared to this " he says "there was big competition to get to work here so weve all been working out " the venetians designs arent perfect ceilings painted to look like sky here also feature water sprinklers which despite attempts by painters blend them in sully the visual effect opening ceremonies and concerts aside entertainment options have been slow to develop here this fall the venetian has lined up two nba exhibition games and a soccer match featuring the british team manchester united the permanent cirque du soleil production is still a ways off elsewhere in macau casinos so far stage little entertainment besides filipino cover bands or "exotic dance" shows but the main attraction for many of the thousands of visitors who came here yesterday was one thing gambling chinese style gambling is a serious affair the target audience here sips tea not alcohol while playing baccarat the chinese gamblers game of choice players treat game play like a war with the house and fellow gamblers sitting at the same table are often expected to make similar bets in order to gang up against the luck of the house though it is harder for the untrained eye to see the venetian has also paid very careful attention to feng shui the traditional art of designing spaces that are harmonious and auspicious matthew prior the sands executive in charge of building the facility says he worked with a hong kong based feng shui master to vet the orientation overall design and use of water in the facility "we had to balance out all of the key elements " he says feng shui also played a role in the timing of yesterdays activities per the masters recommendation the giant line of visitors that snaked around the outside of the building began entering the casino at a time that based on mr adelsons birthday he deemed especially lucky
