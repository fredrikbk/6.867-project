the mossberg solution printer digital picture frame in one new h p photo center prints edits and adds personal touch to shots digital picture frames store numerous images and display them in a mini slide show adding life to a room filled with unchanging framed print shots and digital shots always have a leg up on prints because they can be edited cropped and improved but people value the permanency of prints which they can hold frame or add to an album this week i tested a product that marries prints with the digital frame hewlett packards &# hp photosmart a home photo center the a is the latest in h ps series of compact countertop home snapshot printers meant to turn out small photos quickly but it has an unusual form with a large seven inch screen that also allows for images to be displayed in slide shows like a digital picture frame this touch screen also lets users edit shots using a finger or stylus pressing one button prints the image in about a minute and a half this new model due in stores this weekend is meant to work as a home photo kiosk so its a bit bigger than h ps compact photo printers which have built in handles for portability and take up less space the a is also pricier than these smaller printers &# more than the newest model i liked the idea behind this photo printer editing station and digital frame its large screen inches of which are used for the photos was a welcome change to most photo printers with preview screens that cant be seen without squinting but i was disappointed by some of the as features the newly added ability to draw on images for example yielded results that looked fine on screen but printed out looking like scribble removing red eye didnt seem to improve images on the screen only when printed did these shots appear red eye free and the touch screen wasnt as sensitive as i wouldve liked requiring a few tries to get some buttons to respond i couldnt help but compare the a with standalone digital frames unlike almost all such frames the a lacks internal storage meaning that in order to keep a slide show going a memory card usb drive or camera would need to be plugged into the device some digital frames also come with built in wireless networking to pull images from the web the a doesnt have this capability this device is hard to miss its rounded edges are covered in a stylish white plastic and the screen is surrounded by black and a pretty shade of pale blue making it look like a prop from the jetsons cartoon it measures roughly the same width as h ps compact photo printers but stands more than twice as tall with the screen at the top so users dont have to bend as far down to see images photo paper measuring by or by inches feeds into the back of the printer in a neat enclosed compartment that holds up to sheets a tiny speaker on the front side of the a emits cutesy chimes whenever the device powers on or finishes printing a photo which i liked it also uses its large screen for illustrating how to perform tasks like loading paper or inserting a print cartridge i got started using the hp photosmart a for its digital frame capabilities inserting my digital cameras securedigital memory card into a slot below the viewing screen and queuing up about images from my memory card images appear on the screen six at a time and in the bottom left corner of each there is a white circle which can be touched to give it a red checkmark putting it in the slide show queue tapping the center of any shot magnifies it for editing i marked about photos and played them in succession by touching a slideshow button on the far right edge of the screen this touch screen button and others representing menu back print scroll left and scroll right line the left and right black borders of the screen only the buttons that make sense to choose at any given time will glow so users know which ones can be selected and therefore can navigate a little easier for instance in the get creative editing menu only the scroll left scroll right and back buttons glow i folded up a flap that covers the memory card slots and left my slide show playing for a while on my kitchen counter it worked like a digital picture frame for the most part if the a isnt used for about minutes it will automatically switch into slide show mode a feature i found useful for moments when i didnt remember that i left it on this automatic slide show switches over to a black screen after about an hour though programmed slide shows stay on until turned off touching the screen when an image appears mid slide show will pause the slide show for editing or printing i used my finger to do simple editing and most options are offered in large touch screen buttons though in more than one instance i had to press buttons with my finger a few times to get them to work a small white stylus helped especially for drawing on photos i drew cartoon bubbles coming out of peoples mouths and wrote little messages like "hey yall " bubbling from a texan friend in a shot from her trip to europe these touches can be done in different colors and line thicknesses and mistakes can easily be erased they looked good on screen but when printed turned pixilated and detracted from the photo i tried some more normal photo editing such as cropping photos enhancing a photos brightness and removing red eye the last of these options didnt work so well in my photos seeming to leave eyes glowing on the screen when i printed these shots for the sake of testing i realized that red eye was actually removed in almost all instances but this is confusing for users who dont want to waste ink and paper finding out whether or not the image was corrected i found the as most useful photo enhancing option to be the ability to add captions to shots these can be entered by using an on screen keyboard choosing from five fonts and six colors the caption can be dragged around the screen to test where it will look best these typed fonts looked professional and neat especially compared with my own drawn on editing printing on the hp photosmart a worked without a problem it comes with five by inch sheets of paper enough ink for by inch prints value packs of paper and ink for by inch prints cost &# the printer automatically detects whether its loaded with photo paper measuring by or by inches and prints accordingly a by inch shot takes a bit longer to print but looked rather good the hp photosmart a seems like it was designed with good intentions and its large touch screen is an improvement all on its own but too many features of this device didnt work the way they should from red eyes that didnt appear fixed on screen to the touch screen that didnt always respond right away h p will find an eager audience with this home photo kiosk but it needs improvement edited by walter s mossberg email mossbergsolution wsj com
