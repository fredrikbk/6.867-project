guilty mind the girl gives me mens rea and actus reus isnt far behind that is the chorus of "mens rea " a song by uc berkeley school of law boalt hall second year law student josh keesan from his minialbum "the law of rock vol " which contains original songs inspired by his first year law classes when the year old native of rochester n y started his first year of law school last fall he said he used music to achieve some creative balance in his life as well as give his stressed out fellow students something to laugh about "during the first week of contracts i heard the term promissory estoppel and almost immediately a heartbreaking love song was born " he says in "promissory estoppel " which refers to a principle of contract law concerning a persons ability to rely on a promise mr kessan sings we made plans far ahead and now you say you want me dead well too bad cause its promissory estoppel "i believe that legal rocknroll is the next big thing in music a genre waiting to be

become a jury of one with the lawyer juror pulling all the strings and guiding the jury to a particular outcome when a trial lawyer does select a fellow attorney to serve on a jury it is almost always because the trial lawyer believes the fellow attorney is a sure winner for her his side of the case "
