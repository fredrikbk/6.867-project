politics &amp economics new names emerge as possible gonzales successor white house appears to be in no rush to find permanent replacement washington the white house search for a new attorney general widened as the bush administration appeared to be in no hurry to find a permanent successor for alberto gonzales and weighed strategies for dealing with hostile democratic senators white house officials signaled they dont intend to make side deals with democrats to ensure a confirmation with a well respected interim replacement already named white house officials continued contacting potential candidates yesterday to gauge their interest aides said among the likely contenders emerging from the broad mix was george terwilliger a former deputy attorney general in the administration of mr bushs father according to some people close to the white house mr terwilliger was a leader of the legal team for the current president bush during the election recount he also is a former u s attorney for vermont that could make him a popular choice with federal prosecutors around the country who were left demoralized by the firings of several of their number by mr gonzales a move that led to his downfall mr terwilligers vermont roots also could be a selling point with the democratic chairman of the senate judiciary committee patrick leahy of vermont one person close to the white house said mr terwilliger is a favorite of white house counsel fred fielding another possibility although less likely is laurence silberman a senior federal appeals court judge mr silberman is regarded as a staunch conservative with extensive experience in intelligence matters whose thinking would mesh well with the white house he is also thought to be a favorite of vice president dick cheney but some people close to the white house believe mr silberman isnt interested in the job still another contender is theodore olson the former solicitor general a conservative who is widely respected and well liked in the legal community homeland security secretary michael chertoff who got a lot of attention on monday appeared to be unlikely people close to the white house said at the same time the white house was casting a wide net an administration official said there is continuing discussion with other potential candidates possibly including some current federal judges there was even informal brainstorming among white house outside advisers of some unexpected possibilities such as retired supreme court justice sandra day oconnor harvard law professor charles fried and federal appeals judge j harvie wilkinson iii who has been considered in the past for the supreme court a senior administration official sought to dismiss those possibilities however one reason for the lack of urgency could be that the administration is comfortable with the new acting attorney general solicitor general paul clement who was tapped on monday in the wake of mr gonzaless resignation mr clement is regarded as more of a prospect for a high ranking judicial nomination than as a permanent successor for mr gonzales but he is a strong conservative who is likely to work well with the white house a bigger reason however could be that the white house fears the confirmation process will become an opportunity for democrats to extract painful concessions relations between the white house and senate democrats already have frayed over the long running battle concerning the firings of the u s attorneys and the subsequent demands for documents and testimony which the administration is fighting in many instances now some republicans worry that as part of a deal for confirmation of mr gonzaless successor democrats might seek appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the controversies that clouded mr gonzaless tenure including the firing of a number of u s attorneys last year
