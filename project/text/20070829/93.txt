analyst david veal said as of mid july before the companys second quarter earnings release nearly five million nighthawk shares or of the float were sold short "the bears are very vocal on this name " pointing to among other concerns insider selling an opinion that the core business is commoditized and has a low barrier to entry and the idea that regulators might clamp down on overseas radiology

teleradiology services according to the company "basically theyre the leader in the outsourced radiology reads market " rbc dain rauscher analyst alan robinson who rates the company at "outperform " with a &# price target said he upgraded his rating last month from "sector perform " citing three recent acquisitions and second quarter results that indicate core growth continues nighthawk fills a need as the number of radiology reads in the u s is increasing at a year while the number of qualified radiologists domestically grows at roughly a year mr robinson said citing company figures "youve got a rapid increase in the number of scans taken but nowhere near as rapid an increase in the radiologists taking these scans " he said nighthawks zurich and sydney radiologists can work during the day providing overnight services to u s hospitals that find it difficult to staff their radiology departments during those hours the companys original bread and butter business involves preliminary radiology reads during weekends and other off hours mr robinson said he and others had been concerned that nighthawk would run into a ceiling in a couple of years as some hospitals dont need the companys services and "theyre basically going to saturate the market " the company however has been expanding its markets by adding complimentary services including final radiology reads and computerized tomographic angiography or cta scans to detect cardiovascular problems these types of services generally involve daytime readings by domestic doctors nighthawk continues to beef up its core business as well in february the company purchased teleradiology diagnostic service inc the leading provider of off hours teleradiology services on the west coast for an undisclosed amount in

facilities and human resources management and transcription nighthawk paid &# million for midwest physician services which was part of st paul radiology and a related off hours emergency teleradiology business "we are offering much broader solutions to our customers than we were a year ago " nighthawks president and chief operating officer timothy mayleben says investors want to see that this transition year goes smoothly and that nighthawk gains traction in its new businesses which include services launched within the company as well as acquisitions he says management dismisses the notion that the core business of preliminary off hour reads is slowing while the percentage growth may be lower than in the past because the company which is growing both from the acquisitions and internally is larger than it used to be nighthawk expects the core business to grow by a year excluding acquisitions and anticipates steady growth on a dollar volume basis mr mayleben said he said the preliminary off hours radiology reads market offers a &# billion opportunity while daytime final reads present an estimated &# billion market opportunity the integration of teleradiology diagnostic service will be complete this month and the radlinx integration should be completed in the fourth quarter mr mayleben said all but one tds radiologist remained with the company and nighthawk expects to keep "a great majority" of radlinxs radiologists he said as for the large short interest in nighthawk "as much as we try we dont understand why people buy our stock and drive it up or sell the stock or short the stock " he said "with relatively unseasoned public companies investors take a missouri approach to things which is they want us to show em " he said missouri is known as "the show me state " nighthawk has assembled a management team with experience handling acquisitions mr mayleben said rbcs mr robinson sees the acquisitions as catalysts to growth with potential for significant earnings contributions through cross selling and operational savings on the second quarter call he said the company indicated it was meeting its goal for noncore businesses contribution to revenue revenue in the second quarter increased including organic revenue growth of the company which generated &# million in revenue last year raised its revenue and earnings guidance nighthawks revenue guidance was more than mr robinson would have expected from the acquisitions alone "so again that speaks in that they have confidence in their ability to cross sell these products " he said "theyve really executed above my expectations this year " the company has developed a strong bench through promotions and new hires mr robinson said including mr mayleben and a new chief financial officer glenn r cole goldman sachs said recent meetings with the ceo and finance chief "reaffirmed our view of attractive secular industry growth and the companys broadening business solutions strategy " goldman called nighthawk its favorite investment idea in the facilities space as the firm sees upside potential to its &# price target a standard &amp poors equity analyst who rates the stock a "hold" wrote this month that "we see significant growth potential for this business as well as for other teleradiology activities such as final reads and specialty services " recent acquisitions have augmented the core business said s&amp p which sees risks from potentially greater than expected competitive pressures execution in new businesses and possible unfavorable developments in medicare and
