things get ugly over a beauty injection maker of antiwrinkle shot famed skin doctor face off over new products safety diane goostree had come to arnold w kleins beach house overlooking the pacific ocean to try to dissuade the skin doctor to the aging rich and famous from leading a campaign to have her companys wrinkle smoothing product artefill banned as they sipped flavored water in laguna beach calif she laid out data that had persuaded the food and drug administration to approve the amalgam of calf collagen and microscopic plastic beads that is injected into the face to permanently fill creases but at the end of the calm exchange the flamboyant year old beverly hills dermatologist remained "unimpressed " still worried that artefill and products like it could "destroy" the medical field he helped pioneer "there wasnt anything that showed the biological reaction of this stuff under the skin " dr klein says for her part ms goostree chief executive of artes medical inc says his concerns are based on "inaccurate out of date and or incomplete information " dr klein has become the loudest voice in the hottest debate in the small world of cosmetic dermatology how safe is a new wave of anti wrinkle shots that unlike their predecessors are long lasting or even permanent at medical conferences in recent months doctors have bickered over whether these products receive rigorous enough testing to gain fda approval products like artefill are considered implanted medical devices not drugs and undergo a different approval process because unlike drugs they are believed to basically be inert fillers leaving bodily processes unchanged some doctors however believe that the effects of these products on tissue need to be studied before they are approved because unlike earlier facial injections such as restylane a device or botox a drug these treatments dont just wear off in four to six months as ms goostree points out though the only clinical study anyone can point to is the artes study relied on by the fda an update she adds recently showed patients injected by properly trained physicians continue to do well after five years "we have confidence in our product and in the fda process that approved it as safe and effective " she says that hasnt stopped dr klein who has recruited like minded high profile physicians and hired dbc public relations experts in washington to help spread his concerns dr klein says the longer duration of the new products comes with the risk of unsightly lumps that could require surgical removal and leave ugly scars something ms goostree says doesnt happen when artefill is injected properly dr klein and seven other physicians are asking the fda for a public hearing to re examine artefills safety even though the agency approved it in october a letter from them hand delivered to the fda commissioner in july says artefill "may pose immediate debilitating and disfiguring health risks " dermatologist amy n newburger who was part of an fda panel that recommended artefills approval has sent a less strident letter in an interview dr newburger says she wants the fda to toughen its review process for aesthetic devices "there needs to be a paradigm shift in the process so that people will know what risks they are embracing " scores of emerging injectable fillers will be coming to the fda she says dr newburger practices in scarsdale n y and says she doesnt have financial ties to industry daniel schultz director of the fdas center for devices and radiological health says he is aware of only one adverse event caused by artefill but he said that in response to "a small number of physicians complaints " the agency has set up a team to examine the post marketing experience of all dermal fillers while the size of required human tests of such devices is usually smaller than those for drugs he says the approval process "is very very similar " the role of physicians who become activists like dr klein is complicated in a world where doctors often are paid by companies to perform scientific research and teach others how to use their products in this case dr klein has past and current ties to artefill competitors from until last april dr klein worked for allergan inc which sells botox and juvederm and since he has been a consultant to restylane maker medicis pharmaceuticals corp dr klein who made &# a year from allergan for several years says such ties "have nothing to do whatsoever" with his concerns about artefill "i refuse to see the field of soft tissue augmentation destroyed " he says of his motivation allergan and medicis say that dr klein is acting on his own the attack on artefill is a challenge for artes san diego calif which raised about &# million in a public offering in december and is struggling to get artefill off the ground in march artes submitted favorable data to the fda on a five year follow up study of patients who were treated with an earlier version of the product artefill consists of microscopic plastic particles suspended in calf collagen the collagen is absorbed by the body and then replaced by the patients own collagen ms goostree says the polymer beads are permanent ms goostree says similar polymers are used in other implanted medical devices including bone cement and pacemaker covers the technology was invented by a german physician gottfried lemperle who co founded artes in with his sons stefan and martin earlier versions of artefill called arteplast and artecoll have been sold by other companies for years in europe and canada in the swiss federal health agency advised physicians against the use of any "non resorbable filling material" for treatment of wrinkles though it wasnt an outright ban in a securities and exchange commission filing for its stock sale last year artes disclosed that dr gottfried lemperle illegally injected nine people in the u s before artefill was approved for marketing the fda the filing said confirmed to the company that it had opened a criminal investigation of the matter a product liability and fraud suit filed against the company and gottfried and stefan lemperle among others was withdrawn after the fda probe came to light but an attorney for a patient who claims she was disfigured says he expects to refile it later artes says the lemperles are no longer affiliated with the company except as stockholders gottfried lemperles attorney megan richmond san diego calif declined to comment neither stefan lemperle or his attorney could be reached the fda tests were conducted with artecoll and when they were finished the agency said artes would have to agree to some changes to gain approval refinements to the process of making the beads that the collagen be harvested from a tightly monitored herd in the u s and that the product be manufactured in an fda approved facility after meeting those requirements artes changed the name to artefill artes says it has so far trained about doctors in the injection technique for artefill tina alster a washington dermatologist says her patients havent had any problems with artefill she says that patients who have spent "oodles" of money over the years are asking for something longer lasting she charges about &# per syringe of artefill or more than double the &# price for the first syringe of a temporary filler like restylane ms goostree says that when she met with dr klein he wasnt aware of the data from the five year study on the artecoll patients and didnt understand the refinements that had been done at the fdas request dr klein says the products name keeps changing but theres no evidence that it is improving because the new product was not the one tested he and other critics also say the original artes study was too small to yield reliable results and the follow up study tracked only about of the patients treated with the product ms goostree says that is "a very very good percentage " a new york plastic surgeon who signed the letter daniel c baker says he has seen half a dozen patients who had artecoll injections in other countries "with significant deformities " last month "i did a pretty extensive operation to remove it" from the lips and smile lines of a woman injected in paris he says dr baker says he hasnt reviewed artess data and adds that he has "no commercial interests or affiliations and i never have " ms goostree says it was "quite likely" that the physician who had administered the shot hadnt been properly trained another signer san francisco dermatologist richard glogau says his primary goal is to persuade the fda to overhaul its review process for cosmetic injectables including requiring studies of what happens to human tissue when products like artefill are injected dr glogau consults for allergan and medicis among other companies but says those relationships dont sway his professional judgment
