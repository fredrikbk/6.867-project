common sense does credit crunch signal deep woes in economy smartmoney is the recent credit crunch a "financial" crisis likely to be short lived or is it a more profound "economic" crisis likely to have longer lasting more serious consequences this is now the great debate on wall street main street and in global capitals as investors try to assess the recent credit paralysis and market turmoil the answer is of pressing interest since the first scenario makes the recent stock market decline a compelling buying opportunity while the other is cause for caution last week as markets stabilized and credit began to flow however haltingly proponents of the more benign short term financial crisis seemed to gain the upper hand in this view the problem is largely psychological a panic induced fear of risk rather than anything more fundamental apt comparisons are the market crash of aggravated by the failure of program trading and the collapse of long term capital management in which prompted the federal reserve to cut interest rates while those crises were painful for many investors they had negligible impact on the broad economy and represented buying opportunities for stock investors market averages were significantly higher six months later in both instances history however instructive never repeats itself exactly the current crisis cant be dismissed quite so easily apart from the credit panic several more fundamental forces are at work first is the broad and sharp decline in real estate prices the result has been a plunge in construction home sales and housing related consumer spending and an alarming rise in foreclosures the recent credit crisis had a very real economic underpinning which was the failure of borrowers to make their mortgage payments the scope of the problem has been unfolding slowly originating in subprime but moving up the ladder of creditworthiness and affluence a second related fundamental development is the broad deleveraging now under way in everything from commodities to private equity led buyouts as long as credit was easily available and packaged into seemingly safe triple a rated packages of debt obligations anything could be bought leveraged and sold off to a higher bidder now that lenders have rediscovered the notion of risk those days are over faced with these two fundamental threats to the economy market historians might point to the savings and loan crisis of the late s and early s and the collapse of the junk bond market after the failure of a proposed leveraged buyout of ual both entailed some degree of financial panic but also involved real economic issues the s&amp l crisis unfolded over years not days and took a massive bailout from congress the collapse of the ual deal led to a near halt in buyouts and mergers there was a recession in albeit a relatively mild one the s&amp p peaked in july at and reached a low for the year of in october i could argue the similarities and differences between then and now at some length but one thing i can say with confidence is that the present isnt exactly like anything in the past lets assume that the housing mortgage debt crisis is bad but not as bad as the s&amp l mess the major market averages have already undergone corrections which suggest that further downside risk isnt all that great nonetheless i remain wary of private equity and hedge fund stocks investment banks and all but the largest and most diversified companies in the financial sector i doubt the market has fully priced the likelihood of more bad news on the buyout front just as it failed to anticipate the severity of the subprime defaults yet i was very comfortable buying stocks recently even if further declines are in store while were pondering history its worth considering that most bear markets dont begin with a "crisis" or a sudden plunge in stock prices it would be so much easier for investors if they did thereby announcing their arrival with fanfare more often they creep up with slow agonizing declines punctuated by occasional "suckers rallies " no crisis or sudden selloff marked the beginning of the bear market yet the bear market of set the stage for the massive bull market of the rest of the decade when i wrote that the s&amp p peaked at in that wasnt a typo seventeen years later its at looked at from the long term even the s&amp l bailout and junk bond collapse of was a buying opportunity james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
