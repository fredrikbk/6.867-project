u s canada place curbs on use of some bombardier crj jets citing serious and persistent safety problems with hundreds of older bombardier inc jets flown by regional airlines around the world u s and canadian aviation regulators have slapped unusually tight restrictions on continued operation of the aircraft increasingly frequent instances of stuck or improperly operating flaps on bombardier crj and jets have prompted safety mandates on both sides of the border after a decade of concern and remedial actions flaps are movable panels at the rear of the wing that are extended for additional lift during takeoffs and landings no fatal accidents have been attributed to flap defects in separate but coordinated actions over the past few weeks the u s federal aviation administration and the transportation safety board of canada ordered airlines flying the small jetliners to make changes in their maintenance pilot training and dispatching practices introduced in the planes are primarily used by commuter airlines flying for almost all major u s carriers the safety directives apply to about crj airplanes registered in the u s and or more delivered to airlines elsewhere the planes seat between and passengers a spokesman for bombardiers aerospace unit said it issued a voluntary safety message to operators in march and has been working with regulators airlines and suppliers the government directives while a black eye for the montreal based company are unlikely to have a significant financial impact because none of the affected models remain in production the directives dont apply to bombardiers newer larger models which can seat from to more than people the latest moves spell out specific conditions regarding when where and how aircraft can continue to be used regulators typically dont interfere in airline operations with such strict new operating limits particularly years after aircraft have been certified as safe the new rules include everything from acceptable runway conditions and requirements for carrying extra fuel to detailed procedures for testing or replacing parts that control the flaps if flaps dont work a plane must be able to stay lower than feet to get to an alternative airport since extreme cold can prevent the devices from moving the faa has even identified a minimum temperature range at cruise altitude minus degrees celsius minus degrees fahrenheit below which the planes routinely arent authorized to fly when their destination runway requires use of flaps because it is slippery the new faa rules are slated to go into effect next week and the agency said it is working on longer term maintenance and pilot training mandates
