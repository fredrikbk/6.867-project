business world lessons of a food fight lawyers for the federal trade commission apparently cant believe their "gotcha" haul of off color statements by whole foods ceo john mackey wasnt enough to block his merger with wild oats a competing chain in the absence of serious antitrust evidence wailed the agency to an appeals court last week the judge who refused our injunction request ignored the substance of our case he sure did judge paul friedman barely eluded the pith of the ftcs complaint a private email from mr mackey to his board in which the hyperbolic ceo said the acquisition would "eliminate a competitor" and "avoid nasty price wars " you can find judge friedmans opinion at the web site of the u s district court for the district of columbia he found in essence that no amount of blather by mr mackey in a state of competitive heat can overcome the relevant facts whole foods competes against the entire universe of food retailers not just wild oats even if both happen to style themselves "natural foods" supermarkets "the evidence before the court demonstrates that other supermarkets compete today for the food purchases of customers who shop at whole foods and wild oats and that whole foods customers already turn for some of their food purchases to the full range of supermarkets " wrote the clinton appointee duh but the agency did succeed at least in its primary tactical aim embarrassing mr mackey not only was it able to flaunt his unguarded memo to his board it disclosed his habit of unwisely posting his anonymous thoughts on a yahoo message board it even managed "inadvertently" to leak some of his companys confidential information to the press it wasnt judge friedmans job to ask why ftc would bring such a frivolous case in the first place at times like these one must consult the work of james buchanan who won a nobel prize for applying what economics tells us about incentives to the behavior of government officials to wit they are people and frequently behave like people they dont necessarily get up everyday thinking "what can i do today to advance the general welfare " they frequently think "what can i do to advance my own interests what can i do to extort tribute from the private sector what can i do to blackmail politicians into increasing my resources and privileges what can i do to manipulate the media " antitrust agencies are especially prone to these habits because frankly they lack useful ways to occupy their time so few are the opportunities in a modern economy for businesses to create meaningful exploitable durable monopolies trustbusting agencies must employ bold ingenuity to keep themselves and the washington antitrust community busy in this regard a landmark in bar lowering was the surprise success of the ftcs move to nix a merger of staples and office depot two office supply chains in a world full of office supply retailers on grounds that they offered consumers a unique "shopping experience " weve been off to the races ever since thats how we got the whole foods case in which the agency argued the chain must be regulated as a potential monopolist because some whole foods shoppers its "core customers" might refuse to shop elsewhere even for lower prices and better service the appeal of such reasoning to trustbusters is obvious successful differentiation through mere marketing can be reason enough to subject a company to antitrust regulation by such logic ford might be a monopolist if some number of customers refuse to consider anything but a taurus no matter how serviceable the substitutes from toyota etc alas such regulatory grabs are especially common in the waning days of a weakened administration see the fccs sudden enthusiasm for wireless "open access" or the justice departments play for new regulatory authority over the porn film industry for better and worse antitrust seldom rises to the level of a threat to the general prosperity giving politicians little reason to blow the whistle our over the rainbow solution would be simply to cancel the antitrust laws and leave it to congress to legislate singly in the case if it ever arises of a true monopoly that threatens the public good an absurd prescription check out "does antitrust policy improve consumer welfare " by brookings institution economists clifford winston and robert crandall it can be found in the fall journal of economic perspectives we wont expect such lessons to trickle down anytime soon but europe also offers a variation worth considering unlike their u s counterparts europes trustbusters can be sued for damages when found to have abused their discretion and authority a seminal verdict came in a ruling last month in favor of schneider electric a french company that had been forced to unwind a merger at great cost on sloppy antitrust analysis people who work in government may be acting in good faith and concerned with the public good the schneider case shows that its unwise to give them credit for doing so in advance of or contrary to the evidence once we get over such naive sentiments theres much to be said for enforcing accountability by making regulators liable for damages when they dont act in good faith in carrying out their public mandates mr jenkins edits "political diary " the editorial pages daily email newsletter with commentary analysis and gossip on washington d c
