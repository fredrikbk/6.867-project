after dave how wendys faltered opening way to buyout new ceo sought return to founders values peltz waiting to pounce no headline available dublin ohio when kerrii anderson won the permanent chief executive post at wendys international inc last november she called the year old widow of wendys founder dave thomas with the news "can you handle this " lorraine thomas recalls asking her she doubted ms anderson an accountant by training was the right person to revive the hamburger chain that has struggled since mr thomass death five years ago ms anderson insisted she was up to it but nine months later the ceos turnaround plan is floundering franchisees accuse her of mismanaging the chains menu expansion and launching quirky ad campaigns that have alienated some loyal customers big shareholders complain that the duke university mbas lack of operating experience should have precluded her from the top job and now her board is shopping for a buyer yesterday triarc cos parent of the arbys chain said it had reached a confidentiality agreement with wendys to review financial data in order to prepare a possible bid chairman nelson peltz has indicated that triarc is willing to offer as much as &# a share wendys shares rose cents or to close at &# on the new york stock exchange ms andersons turbulent tenure shows how tough it is for todays ceos to please their many constituents "we did create &# billion worth of shareholder value last year " she says referring to stock gains at both wendys and its tim hortons chain which the company spun off in but that hasnt stopped the likes of mr peltz who holds wendys shares through a hedge fund from pushing for major changes or mr thomass widow and son from griping that ms anderson is out of tune with customers investors "dont have to like me " ms anderson allows "i just have to perform " other big companies such as apple inc and sony corp have strained to sustain their edge after the loss or even temporary departure of an iconic founder in addition to crafting strategies and inspiring workers their leaders each made distinct cultural imprints on the brands they built daves shadow it hasnt been easy working in the shadow of mr thomas the high school dropout who grew his single location hamburger outlet into the nations no fast food chain and starred in its folksy commercials after wendys went public in and mr thomas became chairman he filled his board with acquaintances and local businesspeople he also handpicked the companys chief executives directors deferred to him on most decisions says james pickett wendys current chairman no one questioned that approach after all the chains sales and earnings grew steadily for most of the next quarter century wendys salad bars fresh not frozen beef and baked potatoes gave it a reputation for serving higher quality food than mcdonalds corp and other rivals wendys "was all driven by dave " says gary rozanczyk a wendys franchisee who began working for mr thomas more than years ago "you just trusted this man that he was going to do the right thing " one saturday morning in mr thomas answered the front door of his columbus home wearing a golf shirt shorts and tennis shoes his invited guest was a woman sporting a black dress with a jacket kerrii anderson had come to interview for a job as wendys chief financial officer ms anderson now years old grew up on a tobacco farm in elon n c in high school she joined the cheerleading team and after taking a two week certification course drove her school bus to earn extra money competitive from an early age she used to sing in pageants and talent shows by the time a recruiter called about the wendys gig shed logged years as cfo at m i schottenstein homes inc a columbus home building company with restaurant sales of &# billion a year wendys was several times larger than her longtime employer she didnt have designs on the food chains top job "i was aspiring to be a great cfo " she says talking with mr thomas in his living room ms anderson says she was struck by how down to earth he was "dave" wasnt the kind of executive who prized fancy degrees over hands on experience even for high level posts during the interview ms anderson recalls being grilled about her credentials "youre not a cpa are you " mr thomas asked she told him she was "youre not an mba are you " he followed up she said she was "kerrii " he told her "you cannot think like an accountant you have to take care of your customer " ms anderson landed the job in august of at the time fast food executives worried that the burger market had limited growth potential and began to look at other outlets serving different fare wendys had already bought the canadian doughnut chain tim hortons a few years earlier and it had been a big success so in ms anderson working with ceo jack schuessler began exploring new restaurant concepts by then mr thomas was no longer deeply involved in the companys day to day operations after battling a slow growing cancerous tumor for a decade he had stopped taping commercials due to his deteriorating health in january he died of liver cancer at age "the loss of dave was a major blow " mr pickett says in addition to losing the founder "what we lost was our emotional connection to the consumer " the company left his office intact including the pictures of his children on the walls four months after mr thomass death wendys bought baja fresh mexican grill for &# million ms anderson says the so called fast casual chain specializing in fresh prepared mexican food seemed "squarely focused" on what customers wanted in a restaurant mcdonalds had a similar hunch it had acquired a majority stake in chipotle mexican grill a baja rival but wendys already was beginning to lose its competitive edge new marketing campaigns like one featuring a character called "mr wendy " didnt resonate like mr thomass ads a fruit salad and other new offerings failed to catch on meanwhile mcdonalds was picking up market share luring customers with popular chicken sandwiches and fancier salads the bad news continued in the companys net income sank by to &# million mostly because baja fresh wasnt performing as well as planned and its stock was flat for the year then in march a california woman claimed to have found a severed human finger in a serving of wendys chili she later admitted to planting the digit as part of a false insurance claim scheme nevertheless the negative publicity drove away customers william ackman an investor whose hedge fund pershing square capital management owned of wendys shares began pressuring the company to spin off tim hortons at the same time mr peltzs hedge fund trian fund management was quietly accumulating a significant position in wendys stock in recent years the billionaire investor has built up stakes in a number of food companies including h j heinz co and kraft foods inc and then pushed them to change he approached mr schuessler in late and demanded that wendys spin off tim hortons and sell baja fresh some of dave and lorraine thomass five children worried that mr peltz and other hedge fund investors threatened to damage wendys with their demands "you cant tear the company apart to satisfy the shareholders " says pam farber who owns wendys locations in ohio with her siblings by the following spring mr peltz had put three of his allies on the wendys board amid the chains missteps directors were beginning to lose confidence in mr schuessler when he agreed to step down in april the board named ms anderson the interim ceo an ambitious start she was eager to try the reins she had overseen several departments at wendys including the supply chain and human resources ms anderson also knew that she wanted to be the permanent ceo "i thought that the job would certainly be challenging but that the issues wendys faced were issues that i had significant strength in " she says the new title meant more pay in her total compensation was &# million up from the &# million shed received the year before as cfo her year old son picked up on her ambition one day ms anderson recalls he asked her "what happens if you dont get to be the ceo " ms anderson told him that if she didnt get the job she might leave the company "you cant go work somewhere other than wendys " the boy protested ms anderson cut of the companys nonrestaurant jobs added more deli style sandwiches to the menu and hung around wendys kitchens across the country she told operators she wanted to restore mr thomass quality focused homespun values wendys same store sales revenue from stores open at least a year began to grow again during her first six months as interim ceo wendys stock rose by that put it neck and neck with mcdonalds which saw share appreciation of among franchisees ms anderson promised to be a better listener than her predecessor she also quietly sought backing for the top job at her suggestion store operators sent supportive missives to the board franchisees representing roughly wendys locations wrote mr pickett letters asking him to anoint ms anderson "she has a high intellect and is a quick learner " one group wrote but other critical voices were growing louder some directors told mr pickett they didnt feel ms anderson had enough leadership experience for the job highfields capital which owns of wendys shares told mr pickett that choosing ms anderson would be a mistake time and again baja fresh came up the deal ms anderson helped engineer had flopped when the chain didnt grow as quickly as anticipated last october wendys sold baja fresh for about &# million a mere fraction of the &# million it had paid four years before although the chain fetched such a low price investors were relieved to finally be rid of what they viewed as a drag on the companys main business "many of the fast casual restaurants did not meet expectations " says ms anderson also disappointing at least to some thomas family members was the companys marketing in the spring of an idea surfaced to put the original "wendy" in new ads as an year old the red headed wendy thomas posed in braided pigtails for the picture that now adorns wendys locations at the suggestion of her sister ms farber executives arranged for ms thomas now to do a television screen test in the companys corporate kitchen chief marketing officer ian rowden says executives gave the screen test "very very very serious consideration " but no "wendy" campaign ensued this spring the company launched a television ad featuring a young man wearing a wig of red braided pigtails wendy thomas says she took the spot as a personal affront meanwhile wendys recruiters were having trouble finding candidates who were demonstrably better than ms anderson according to a person familiar with the situation in november the board named her permanent ceo of wendys already though ms anderson was skating on thin ice months after she was picked analysts began to conclude that sales and profit goals set by ms anderson in february were overly optimistic while franchisees squawked over her plan to introduce breakfast items still unhappy with wendys ads lorraine thomas told ms anderson she should fire mr rowden the ceo declined to do so and mr rowden maintains that his " focus is with the consumer " the founders widow also urged ms anderson to scrap the morning menu recalling how her husband had written off breakfast as unprofitable egg and biscuit sandwiches are now being served in certain locations mr peltz whose hedge fund and affiliates at the time owned more than of wendys ratcheted up the pressure during an april meeting with mr pickett in arizona mr peltz complained that management hadnt done enough to raise the profit margins at wendys company owned locations which number about one fifth of its outlets mr pickett recalls mr peltz saying he planned to do something substantial with the company without specifying what a spokesman for mr peltz says the investor doesnt remember making such a comment mr peltz had a standstill agreement that prevented him from taking a controlling interest in wendys but the agreement was to expire june directors take action mr pickett decided the board should act on its own in advance of any move from mr peltz shortly after messrs pickett and peltz met wendys directors agreed to explore selling the company or making some other major change including a recapitalization or strategy shift at this point ms anderson had officially been ceo for less than six months though the idea of a sale was not hers she went along with it "i dont think it was that they didnt have confidence in the plan or we werent delivering numbers " she says but "we certainly hadnt achieved the numbers mr peltz had wanted " with the standstill expiration looming she notes the board "had a responsibility to know better than anyone what the possible alternatives for wendys might be " mr thomass widow and several of his children say they were sick over the news and couldnt understand how management had let the company become so vulnerable so far mr peltzs triarc is the only serious bidder that has emerged if triarc or another buyer fires ms anderson without cause she is entitled to a compensation package worth up to &# million based on the companys stock price at the end of last year wendys same store sales facing difficult comparisons from the previous year have flattened in recent months rising prices of beef and other commodities hurt profits in june ms anderson informed investors that wendys wasnt going to do as well this year as shed promised she lowered her earnings per share target to between &# and &# down from &# to &# a share through it all associates say she has remained remarkably upbeat the distraction of a possible sale has at times been "frustrating " she says but she tries to focus on things she can control "sometimes you cant worry about what everybody else says " she muses "youve got to know in your heart that youre doing the right things " julie jargon and joann s lublin contributed to this article
