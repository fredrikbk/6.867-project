wachovia aims to keep brokers it may not quite be a merger of equals when wachovia securities absorbs a g edwards inc but to keep the brokers happy at the st louis firm wachovia appears to be following a mantra that has always worked to retain talent on wall street show them the money even though wachovia corp s &# billion deal for a g edwards is set to close by the end of this year edwardss more than brokers will continue to be paid according to their current compensation structure until wachovia has more than brokers wachovia spokesman tony mattera says the firm is "reviewing both grids and will make sure that nobody is put at a disadvantage" when the integration is finished by the first quarter of he declined to speculate on what the new combined payout plan would look like but noted that when it comes to low revenue financial advisers "we arrive at that very differently " other wire houses that recently acquired regional firms didnt touch their own compensation structure as a result of the mergers the regional brokers simply were forced to use the big brokerages plan wachovia on the other hand apparently plans more of a blending of the two payout plans wachovia and edwards are merging to create a combined brokerage force of almost brokers with &# trillion in client assets and more than brokerage offices one reason for wachovias plan to accommodate the compensation system of edwards is that the two brokerages are similar in size elsewhere citigroup inc which acquired the retail brokerage unit of legg mason inc and merrill lynch &amp co which absorbed advest group inc simply dangled retention packages to keep brokers without changing their compensation structure in the case of wachovia the firm has rolled out a retention deal that allows edwards brokers to receive to of their annual commissions and fees in the form of an upfront forgivable cash loan or cash award in six equal installments plus an additional cash retention award after years managers also will get a retention bonus based on their ability to retain branch revenue which is closely tied to keeping branch talents in the continuing consolidation and recruiting war on wall street retention is a battleground some of wachovias rivals now offer rich deals of more than of the brokers annual revenue to recruits with sizable assets both wachovia and edwards rely more heavily on commission business than the increasingly popular model of earning recurring fees on assets wachovia though has put more of an emphasis on its fee based business which is often seen as more stable and valuable than transaction based commissions in keeping the compensation structure unchanged for edwardss brokers for now wachovia securities hopes to lose no more than of the brokers it wants to keep and their assets of course that rate is similar to the "regretted" attrition it experienced after acquiring prudential securities in alan johnson a new york compensation consultant for financial services companies said significant changes in compensation can be overwhelming "so the idea is to produce stability in order to keep them " this isnt the first time wachovia has revised its payout structure after an acquisition when the company merged with prudential securities it switched from having multiple tiers in its compensation structure to its current two tier grid wachovia brokers are currently required to produce at least &# in commissions and fees every month to get the minimum payout the commission is on everything produced above &# the payout is the same on every product sold edwards on the other hand has a more complicated payout plan compensation consists of a standard payout plus production based cash bonuses at edwards product related compensation rises from to of the commissions for selling stocks and bonds up to for selling mutual funds and up to for selling annuities the payout for fee based advisory programs is a flat in order to qualify for the standard payout brokers must produce at least &# a year with penalties imposed on underperforming veterans for the cash bonus based on production the compensation hits a maximum of for those who produce &# a year and above and is for those who produce &# to &# the cash bonuses are paid for production above &# additional rewards go to those who produce more than &# "moving either firm to the others current compensation platform would put some group of brokers from one firm or the other at a disadvantage " said wachovias mr mattera "for that reason were going to take our time to do the proper planning and create a unified grid that minimizes or eliminates those disadvantages " wachovia faces challenges in reconciling different pay scales revenue per broker at edwards now stands at &# although wachovia executives expect this will rise over the next three years toward wachovia brokers productivity level currently &# an adviser average client assets per edwards broker are &# million compared with &# million at wachovia "when you are putting together a sales force in which one has a higher productivity level " expectations among brokers can clash said mr johnson the compensation consultant firms that choose to reward high end producers could end up squeezing or weeding out low revenue brokers whose businesses are mostly transactional mr johnson said that may be a painful change but in the end he said "youve got to figure out what kind of firm you want to be "
