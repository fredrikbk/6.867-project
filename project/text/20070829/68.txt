lord &amp taylor owner tries on peter som nrdcs investment in designer would start its vertical integration nrdc equity partners the giant retail developer and owner of department store chain lord &amp taylor is near a deal to invest in new york fashion designer peter som according to people familiar with the situation although the deal would be small the investment is expected to be less than &# million it would represent an unusual move by a department store chain to invest directly in high fashion designers it would also be a first step in a strategy by nrdc to become more of a vertical retailer owning everything from shopping centers to department stores to the vendors the stores carry terms of the deal between mr som years old and nrdc arent yet final and the negotiations could still fall apart but people familiar with the deal say the most recent scenario discussed calls for peter som inc to continue to own the peter som trademark and license his name to a new entity a company that will be roughly owned by peter som inc and owned by nrdc though the specific percentages could change slightly the deal is expected to be finalized next week lord &amp taylor wouldnt immediately gain exclusive access to mr soms collections for its stores the department store chain doesnt currently carry the peter som label which is priced at the highest end designer level with blouses in the &# to &# range and dresses generally &# to &# and up however lord &amp taylor would likely get first dibs on any lower price lines mr som develops in the future through a right of first refusal the people familiar with the deal said the deal would come at a time of growing conflict between department stores which are clamoring for "exclusive" designer goods and their key vendors which are trying to limit distribution of their brands and open their own stores department stores that once counted on lines such as liz claiborne inc s juicy couture vf corp s nautica privately held david yurman and polo ralph lauren corp as key suppliers are now competing with the well known designers own stores in malls across the u s nrdc equity partners acquired lord &amp taylor from federated department stores now macys inc for &# billion in june last year the firm is a joint venture between real estate developer william mack and lee neibart who are principals at private equity firm apollo real estate advisors and father and son robert c baker and richard a baker co owners of shopping center developer national realty &amp development corp any deal between nrdc and mr som would represent the culmination of more than six months negotiations a person familiar with the talks said lord &amp taylor which generates annual sales of about &# billion has long been plagued with an aging customer base and merchandise that failed to draw younger wealthy shoppers but nrdc has been revamping the chain and aggressively pursuing partnerships with american designers earlier this year the retailer signed contemporary designer cynthia steffe to help build up its accessories assortments in a deal that might later expand into high end contemporary apparel it arranged for bryan bradley of the designer label tuleh to create an exclusive collection and it also hired designer charles nolan formerly of the anne klein brand to overhaul its private label kate hill bridge line such lines are a notch lower in price than designer lines in a partnership that also could ultimately result in an exclusive collection for the chain next fall mr som who last month was named creative director of womens apparel for fashion brand bill blass owned by nexcen brands inc will have wholesale volume in his own namesake line of about &# million this year sales are expected to grow to close to &# million in a year or two like many young designers mr som is looking to expand and needs financial backing to do so two of the people familiar with negotiations said any deal he reaches with nrdc isnt likely to provide lord &amp taylor with first dibs on his bill blass looks "its no different from the way karl lagerfeld did his work for chanel and for his own brand " said nexcen chief executive bob dloren noting bill blass has a three year contract with mr som "whatever peter does personally with his own brand is his own business " by allowing the designer the ability to retain some control of the brand the deal means mr som might be able to avoid situations like those faced by a number of designers who lost control of their namesake brands after disputes with new owners mr som didnt return messages yesterday seeking comment mr soms eight year old label is known for feminine party dresses and taffeta trench coats in the tradition of designers such as the late mr blass and michael kors where mr som once apprenticed regarded as one of the young turks of fashion his work appears regularly in fashion magazines and on movie stars and he enjoys a following among trendy shoppers his clothing is now sold at more than upscale specialty stores in the u s including bloomingdales owned by macys nordstrom inc and saks inc s saks fifth avenue as well as about stores internationally the move by nrdc is expected to be closely watched by competitors in the past some department stores acquisitions of suppliers havent always worked out earlier this summer nordstrom sold its faconnable apparel and retail line to m group a private group in beirut lebanon for &# million nordstrom paid &# million for faconnable in but soon found operating the chain of french boutiques was fundamentally different from the business of running a u s based department store chain in the late s neiman marcus group inc also tried branching into fashion businesses acquiring majority stakes in kate spade accessories and the purveyor of laura mercier makeup neiman has since divested itself of both stakes
