abandon iraq and abandon the world in his aug editorial page commentary "if iraq falls " josef joffe makes a compelling case that should not be lost on both sides of the congressional divide those who advocate pulling out of iraq at any cost may be well served by a crash course in deterrence theory this war is very different from our vietnam experience for many reasons not the least being the geopolitical terrain in which it is being conducted opponents of americas presence in iraq and afghanistan should consider the long term benefits to world stability of our nation as a prometheus unbound rather than hope for a gulliver with clay feet the price paid by our brave men and women in uniform is very high but the consequences from a precipitous pull out from iraq would encourage the truculent agenda of regional adversaries bent on establishing a "new order" and inevitably lead to a far greater conflagration and unacceptable loss of life michael kaiser lexington mass mr joffes commentary conjures up all sorts of dire consequences should the u s lose in iraq and withdraw but there are errors in his analysis first he assumes that if we withdraw from iraq we will withdraw from the middle east but we could withdraw from iraqs civil war and stay in the persian gulf and keep up our commitments to israel egypt and jordan second he assumes iran will be undeterred should it get nuclear weapons but iran will be deterred by israels substantial nuclear arsenal as well as by our own jonathan galloway burlington vt according to mr joffe u s involvement in iraq is critical as he puts it "if this superpower doesnt care about the worlds central and most dangerous stage what will it care about " mr joffe is right defeating terrorism in iraq is imperative for the preservation of our own national security abandoning iraq would have catastrophic consequences not only for the u s but also for israel lebanon and afghanistan in essence an american capitulation would be disastrous for the civilized world as we know it on the other hand defeating the islamic terrorists in iraq is central for the preservation of israel the enemy is not having any of this debate its objective is the destruction of israel and the western world should america be any less dedicated to protecting its own freedom brian stuckey denver
