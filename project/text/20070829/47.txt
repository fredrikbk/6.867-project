ex soviet states build tourism special to the wsj tbilisi georgia former soviet republics are rolling out the red carpet for western tourists with new hotels cleaned up capital cities and advertising campaigns but are these countries which gained independence after the collapse of the soviet union in attractive holiday destinations the baltics have had the most success so far estonia latvia and lithuania european union members since are geographically and culturally close to western europe and have historic towns beaches and cultural attractions that are an easy sell to europeans who can take inexpensive flights on discount airlines to the region the number of visitors to the baltics has grown to a year in the past few years more than double the average for europe overall according to the european travel commission a group made up of the national tourist offices in european countries the statistics dont distinguish between tourists and other visitors other former republics face bigger problems attracting tourists such as tajikistan with poor roads unsafe taxis and street crime or turkmenistan which a guidebook once called "slightly more inhabitable than the moon" for its dull landscapes harsh winters and blazing hot summers georgia a tiny nation of fewer than five million people south of russia is seeing some success visitors have nearly doubled to about a million last year from the previous year most of the people came from neighboring countries such as armenia azerbaijan ukraine and russia yet of visitors came from europe the u s and asia leaving officials upbeat "it used to be that georgia was europes best kept secret " says the countrys president mikheil saakashvili taking a break from skiing in gudauri a small ski resort two hours from tbilisi "now the secret is out " overstated perhaps but georgia has in a short time undergone a dramatic transformation and a closer look shows how the country has focused on developing tourism in the past three years the capital city of tbilisi has grown far more welcoming roads have been repaved and buildings even some of the enormous soviet era gray ones on the citys outskirts have been painted bright seaside colors in blues greens and pinks fountains in squares have been renovated new sculptures unveiled and in the evening attractive lights now illuminate bridges buildings and trees a novelty for a city that three years ago suffered power outages most nights early this year a modern and stylish airport opened in tbilisi another followed in may in batumi a resort town on the black sea hotel chains marriott and radisson are building luxury hotels in tbilisi marriott has two in the center already there are new roads from tbilisi to ski towns in gudauri and bakuriani where you will find new ski lifts and hotels to train workers the government is opening a vocational school in tbilisi in september with help from the greek government the school will train workers in the tourism sector including front desk clerks waiters and cooks officials have encouraged tourism by eliminating visa requirements for countries such as turkey the u s canada and eu countries for visits of up to days to attract tourists and also foreign investment m&amp c saatchi in london was hired to run a multimillion dollar ad campaign with print and television ads in israel europe and the u s the government also set aside about million euros or about &# million to distribute in preferential loans to small companies that cater to tourists such as guest houses souvenir stores and ski rental shops if the projects are successful an additional million euros will be distributed this year according to a government tourism official meanwhile a special tax incentive was granted to tour operators they no longer pay an tax on income generated from inbound travel to the country as a tourist destination though georgia is like all of its ex soviet neighbors a work in progress many problems still exist some of which date back to the fall of the soviet union during soviet times georgia was a popular destination for russians with more than one million visiting each year they skied and visited black sea beaches and also spa towns such as tskaltubo in western georgia which joseph stalin favored for its mineral springs and grand bathhouses but since the breakup of the soviet union the number of russian tourists has steadily declined and resort areas have fallen on hard times politically georgia remains out of favor with russians past wars and continuing friction over two separatist georgian regions with ties to russia and a recent series of high profile disputes earlier this month a russian jet allegedly dropped a missile that didnt detonate about kilometers miles outside tbilisi have made georgia unpopular with ordinary russians but times are changing in the peaceful rose revolution which removed russian backed leader eduard shevardnadze from power led to a democratic and western leaning government headed by president saakashvili since then money has poured in from the u s europe and other former soviet countries in the form of government grants and private investments still countries can rebuild only so quickly new hotels are coming for example but not fast enough "its a good country for tourists " says english author peter nasmyth who has been visiting georgia for years and wrote a hiking guide to the country "but if lots of high end tourists flooded into tbilisi this year theyd have a difficult time finding a hotel next year it would be a bit easier " progress isnt always smooth soon after the opening of the new airport in tbilisi the roof started to leak then heavy winds damaged it infrastructure in general is far less developed than in western europe while there are many road paving projects streets remain pot holed even in the capital city traveling outside tbilisi is best for rugged or flexible types and a guide is advised english is rarely spoken hotels are often more like hostels with saggy mattresses and bare bulbs hanging from ceilings visitors shouldnt be surprised to find country restaurants even those with excellent food offering an outhouse for facilities with no toilet paper or running water but georgia has attractions that tourists will surely appreciate its biggest selling point in some ways is its underdevelopment the countryside remains largely unspoiled it is rich with natural beauty and for such a small country boasts a wide variety of landscapes including mountains semi deserts forests and beaches "it actually looks like switzerland " says falk spoerri of bern switzerland who recently traveled to the mountain town of bakuriani as part of an american chamber of commerce initiative backed by the u s agency for international development to evaluate and recommend improvements to georgias tourism infrastructure the country is also home to a number of endangered species and attracts bird watchers to see more than types in batumi the best known beach town new hotels have opened in the past few years as well as restaurants bars on the beach a bike rental shop and even a new ice skating rink "generally its a lively friendly atmosphere people playing volleyball at in the morning " says hans gutbrod a german who visited this summer "and it isnt money that is trying to push up to the seafront its more quaint " georgias churches and monasteries some covered in bright frescoes and dating back to the first millennium draw architecture and history buffs the monastic complex of david gareja carved into a mountainside can be reached in less than two hours from tbilisi on recently improved roads in the capital you will find a mixture of neo classical baroque and late th century style buildings decorated with georgian motifs intricately designed in stone or in fanciful metal work although tbilisi has been destroyed many times during its history wood buildings dating back years remain and many are painted in bright colors with ornately carved wood balconies in the restored old town a western style cafe culture has emerged in recent years with outdoor restaurants and live music in the end though what is best about georgia is its famed hospitality at supras the enormous feasts that last hours plates of excellent food are piled high typically one on top of another spicy grilled meats khachapuri or cheese pies made with dough and flavorful vegetable dishes some made with ground walnuts and pomegranates are typical the georgians pride themselves on their wine and for better or worse your glass will never be empty
