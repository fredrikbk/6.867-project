consumers move on to the next big thing in the footwear aisle twenty percent of the stocks float is held by investors in a short interest position meaning they are betting the stock will fall "a lot of people on the bear side think the ugg business is still a fad the idea of wearing sheepskin boots is going to go out of style and when it does the business will suffer " says wedbush morgan analyst

they have been wearing it since the s in australia " says michael unger a director in the retail practice of archstone consulting mr unger said that uggs placement of the sheepskin in many of its core products besides its classic boot has kept the brand relevant "they managed to expand the brand offering outside of the boot but stayed true to the sheepskin " mr unger said deckers has managed to avoid overexposure of the line by carefully managing its placement in stores "they kept the market at higher end distribution that created more demand and resisted the urge to put uggs everywhere " mr
