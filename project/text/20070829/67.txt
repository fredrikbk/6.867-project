lockheed looks to it for growth defense contractor lockheed martin corp one of the biggest providers of information technology services to the u s government sees further opportunities for growth in the segment helping to insulate the company from the likely slowdown in defense spending as the war in iraq winds down the bethesda md company is signing new clients as it capitalizes on increasing world wide demand for information technology services while it continues its primary business of serving traditional customers including the defense department much of its focus domestically is on efforts to ensure that communications technology is better equipped to address homeland defense needs lockheed formed the information systems and global service division in february by combining its integrated systems and solutions business with the information technology and global services unit the business may expand faster than the company overall in the next few years the restructuring at lockheed reflects what has happened with its customers said linda gooden who heads the new unit after the sept attacks in government agencies discovered a need to share information related to the nations security historically agencies such as the federal bureau of investigation and police departments havent shared information partly due to worries about security breaches the buzzword in the market now is "interoperability " said ms gooden a computer specialist who has been with lockheed for years success in the it business could be critical for lockheed as defense stocks in recent years have received a boost from wartime spending that is likely to wind down at some point analyst howard rubel at jefferies &amp co wrote recently that "the risk of investor perception may rise as limits regarding the u s involvement in iraq translate into a constrained dod spending environment " paul nisbet president of jsa research inc in newport r i an aerospace research firm said lockheed has a strong foothold in it services which provides a high rate of return on investment but he has a neutral rating on the stock due to concerns lockheeds revenue will dip in the next two or three years that is mainly because benefits from the f joint strike fighter contract wont kick in for a few years lockheed shares have risen about over the past months in line with gains posted by other major defense companies while lockheed is ready to put programs in place u s homeland security still has a "fractured national communication system " air force general victor renuart commander at the north american aerospace defense command said in recent testimony to congress the government is hampered by a lack of guidelines that would assure that various government agencies have compatible equipment and also suffers from problems with standard operating procedures and planning he said ms gooden said there is a need to get all kinds of information to first responders police and firefighters on the front lines in an emergency "customers are looking for speed innovation and efficiency " she said lockheed believes the sheer size of its business helps the company win it contracts for government programs about of the units projects require it to use resources from across the whole company ms gooden said that includes using employees with expertise in software programming and engineering or having telephone operators take emergency calls many of the companys employees have government security clearance which permits them to work with classified information and many also have special training in various industry sectors in march the company won a contract from the fbi called fbi sentinel to store and manage all of the agencys criminal investigation records while lockheed has been the biggest it provider to the u s government for years "meeting customer needs like sorting mail or conducting a census might not seem like obvious fits with our core business " which includes making the next generation of jet fighters ms gooden said but lockheed and its competitors have been looking for ways to use their expertise to expand business into what they call "adjacent markets " lockheed is working to streamline record keeping at the social security administration it also has taken on the task of computerizing health care files of medicare patients ms gooden recently met with
