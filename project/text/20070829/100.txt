slim pickings in the world of wealth the big news this summer is that carlos slim of mexico may have surpassed bill gates as the worlds richest person inevitably writers compare mr slim who built his wealth on a telecommunications monopoly to americas so called "robber barons" including men such as john d rockefeller james j hill and henry ford this is bad history americas most famous rugged entrepreneurs especially men such as rockefeller and ford the wealthiest men of their eras reached mass markets by producing quality products kerosene and cars at low prices more recently sam walton did the same thing in retailing mr slim by contrast is better characterized as a "political entrepreneur " who relied more on manipulating mexicos bureaucracy than on satisfying consumers in a competitive arena in the great heyday of late th century american capitalism successful businessmen had to innovate and compete as they helped create mass markets government was limited property rights and contracts were protected and except for tariffs and occasional subsidies government could not play favorites whoever satisfied the most customers would have the largest businesses only when rockefeller sold cheap kerosene to tens of millions of americans did he become the nations first billionaire "we must ever remember " rockefeller told his partner "we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good " ironically the price of rockefellers kerosene dropped to eight cents a gallon in from cents in all the while he was viciously pilloried as a monopolist by the press congress and his competitors ford walton and mr gates also had to sell widely to masses of americans at competitive rates before they rose to the top putting a car in every garage not just the garages of the rich was fords working motto in serving the most customers he reaped the largest reward so did bill gates with computers when america did deviate from free markets for example by granting government subsidies to the union pacific and central pacific railroads the economy suffered instabilities but it recovered from the experience and learned a lesson james j hill built the great northern railroad with no federal subsidy and outperformed all other transcontinentals mexico unfortunately has had a long tradition of weak property rights and a strong intrusive government the constitution of almost guarantees economic chaos according to article property is not a right but a social function government officials therefore may confiscate land or industry which in their opinion is not serving a "public use" or the "public interest " inevitably different groups lobbied the mexican government to confiscate property "in the national interest " beginning in the s railroads were nationalized and turned over to union leaders banks the oil industry and some utilities were also expropriated the dreaded oil gringos from the u s were paid off later at about cents on the dollar the new nationalized industries of course performed erratically and incompetently the unions and government officials running these industries had little experience managing large firms and no knowledge of how much their workers were worth how much to invest in new technology which engineers to hire and in the case of oil where to do exploratory drilling pemex the nationalized oil company floundered for decades losing money and trying to recapture lost markets enter carlos slim his father julian slim haddad a lebanese immigrant made his money as a merchant during the chaos leading up to the constitution of carlos slim greatly expanded the family fortune by working closely and cleverly with government officials in fairness to mr slim there may not be another avenue to great wealth in a massively interventionist economy his major opportunity came when president carlos salinas de gortari decided to privatize some inefficient industries mr slim bought telmex the nations phone company in in a controversial auction which was decidedly less than transparent with that purchase came a six year monopoly guaranteed by the government although mr slim was supposed to relinquish the monopoly in he used a variety of legal and political tools to maintain it for example filing injunctions in court to block orders from the regulator to provide competitors fair access to his network according to oecd figures mexican consumers and businesses still pay above market telephone rates fewer than one fourth of mexican homes have telephones with a near monopoly of fixed line telephones and data access the internet mr slim has reaped windfall profits which wisely invested have propelled him to immense wealth meanwhile mr slims newer ventures his construction company and his oil services company rely on government contracts for their major business recently president felipe calderon met with mr slim and urged him to accept greater competition not surprisingly when striving mexicans want to better themselves they look to where competition is the rule and property rights are more secure and head for the land of the robber barons mr folsom is professor of history at hillsdale college and author of "the myth of the robber barons a new look at the rise of big business in america" young americas foundation th edition
