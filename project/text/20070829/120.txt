well connected a saudi mogul skirts sanctions istanbul turkey yassin qadi is a well known multimillionaire founder of a large supermarket chain here and a close friend of the turkish premier "i trust him the same way i trust my father " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said on national television last year but the saudi businessman also is a major financier of islamic terrorism with close business associates who are members of al qaeda according to the u s treasury and the united nations security council at washingtons request the security council ordered mr qadis assets frozen a few weeks after the sept terrorist attacks in the u s the asset freeze has largely crippled mr qadis international business empire but previously undisclosed records show he has managed to free up millions of dollars of holdings in turkey in apparent violation of the security council sanctions and without incurring punishment by turkish authorities the case of mr qadi shows the challenges washington faces in separating friend from foe in the islamic world the records detailing his business activities also suggest how easy it can be to skirt sanctions designed to restrict funding of terrorism especially for well connected figures mr qadis friendship with the prime minister also plays into the growing debate in turkey over the role of islam in a secular society turkeys parliament for the first time yesterday elected a politician with an islamist background foreign minister abdullah gul to the presidency immediately after being sworn in mr gul pledged impartiality saying "secularism one of the main principles of our republic is a precondition for social peace " but the development nonetheless has heightened concern about the direction this pivotal nation poised between east and west is taking within turkey a muslim nation of million with a constitutionally mandated secular government the role of islam has been the subject of intense debate in recent years as rising religious sentiment clashes in some quarters with the countrys longstanding commitment to secularism mr erdogan and his justice and development party are broadly popular but their islamist roots draw criticism and provoke controversy especially among critics in the military amid this debate mr erdogan has been blasted for his ties to mr qadi by political opponents in turkey and some

party just won an overwhelming new mandate in parliamentary elections but tensions are likely to persist u s diplomats lodged strong objections last year when the erdogan government intervened in turkish courts to try to lift the freeze on mr qadis turkish assets according to u s officials the turkish government reversed course "that erdogan personally vouches for this man raises the possibility that the prime minister of turkey is far less interested in combating terrorism than he says " said former defense department aide michael rubin a conservative critic of the turkish government who has close ties to top officials in the bush administration the cosmopolitan mr qadi is an architect by profession who trained with the chicago based firm skidmore owings &amp merrill in

by turkey or mr qadi the panels chairman announced in may it would examine "possible instances of noncompliance" with the al qaeda sanctions the u n sanctions arent always effective according to experts on the subject many countries either dont write or police laws to enforce them or arent equipped to track designees who use offshore companies and complex corporate structures in the case of mr qadis turkish assets the problem is that "there are so many ways of structuring and layering things they are not clearly his assets " said victor comras an attorney and former u n terror finance expert
