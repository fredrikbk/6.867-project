sarko steps up nicolas sarkozy made headlines this week by telling his diplomatic corps that "an iran with nuclear weapons is for me unacceptable " but the french president did more in his speech than name the gravest current threat to global security itself a feat of clear thinking he also signaled that france means to be something more on the international scene than an anti american nuisance player thats worth applauding at a time when the conventional wisdom says the next u s president will have to burnish americas supposedly tarnished reputation by making various policy amends in germany under the conservative leadership of angela merkel foreign policy views have been moving closer to the bush administrations not further away while new british prime minister gordon brown has made clear he will not depart significantly from the pro american course set by tony blair but it is mr sarkozy who true to his reputation has been the boldest in stepping up to his global responsibilities on afghanistan he told the assembled diplomats "the duty of the atlantic alliance as well as that of france " is to "increase efforts " he then announced he would be sending additional trainers to assist the afghan army on israel he said he "would never budge" on its security he warned about russia which "imposes its return on the world scene by playing its assets with a certain brutality " and he cautioned against china which pursues "its insatiable search for raw materials as a strategy of control particularly in africa " its hard to imagine jacques chirac mr sarkozys predecessor speaking this way mr sarkozy has also reportedly described french diplomats as "cowards" and proposed "getting rid of the quai dorsay " imagine the media uproar if president bush mused about doing the same to foggy bottom no less a departure from past practices at the elysee palace is his stance on iran in january mr chirac had mused that an iranian bomb would "not be very dangerous " mr sarkozy by contrast has previously insisted on the need to "leave all options open" when dealing with irans nuclear programs in his speech this week to the diplomats mr sarkozy warned of the need for tough diplomacy including "growing sanctions " to avoid the "catastrophic alternative the iranian bomb or the bombing of iran " that doesnt sound far from senator john mccains useful formulation that "theres only one thing worse than the united states exercising the military option that is a nuclear armed iran " the important point is that mr sarkozy has put on record that he wont let iran develop a bomb under cover of feckless western diplomacy one test of his resolve will be how much france assists the bush administration as it seeks to round up votes in the u n security council for a third round of sanctions on iran next month the administration has had a hard time moving the diplomacy beyond symbolism in part because of the economic ties that other permanent members of the council including france have with the islamic republic the french say theyve already pulled out some of their investments in the country and in recent months france germany and other european countries have in fact cut back their export credits to iran mr sarkozy could now demonstrate real seriousness by forcing french energy giant total from its &# billion investment in the huge south pars natural gas project a corruption probe into the decade old project could give him the leverage to do so as could rising pressure in the u s congress to start enforcing sanctions against companies that do business with rogue regimes whatever mr sarkozy does however he has plainly set a new tone for french foreign policy thats not to say we agree with him on every point he reiterated frances opposition to the war in iraq and called for a "horizon" for the withdrawal of u s troops yet even that puts him well to the right of every u s democratic presidential candidate and he warned against the "risks of an antagonistic multipolar world " the very world mr chirac seemed to strive for by opposing the u s at every turn in a speech last year in new york mr sarkozy noted that "ive always favored modest effectiveness over sterile grandiloquence and i dont want to see an arrogant france with a diminished presence " with his remarks monday mr sarkozy has given the best evidence to date that his presidency will attempt to enhance french influence not by opposing the u s but by working with it
