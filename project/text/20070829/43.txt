dow tumbles as calm ebbs billion dollar question how will street titans value their holdings as the third quarter ends for some of wall streets brokerages this week the firms will be tallying their wins and losses as always but with markets in flux investors would be wise to note how they count them executives are looking more closely than ever at just how to value their holdings some of which plummeted during the quarter they are evaluating whether some of those losses could be viewed as temporary and whether others might be better dealt with as long term investments that could recover over time "weve just made it through a challenging period where there was funding pressure on brokerage firms " said brad hintz a brokerage analyst at sanford c bernstein &amp co llc and a former chief financial officer at lehman brothers holdings inc "now were going to see what was the cost of making it through this period " but how things are labeled and accounted for could go a long way toward determining the size of losses when big firms like goldman sachs group inc and lehman brothers begin reporting results in mid september the worry for investors firms might push the envelope and account for money losing loans and securities in ways that dont fully reflect the extent of losses analysts are warning investors to brace for a rough quarter financial stocks fell yesterday after merrill lynch &amp co analyst guy moszkowski lowered his ratings on bear stearns cos lehman and citigroup inc to "neutral" from "buy " he voiced concern about the exposure bear and lehman have to the debt market he worried about citigroups leveraged loan obligations the loans the bank has made to companies as part of leveraged buyout deals goldman sachs and morgan stanley he said "are best positioned" for the current conditions because their businesses are more diversified in addition to goldman and lehman bear and morgan stanley wrap up their quarter this week merrill lynch j p morgan chase &amp co and citigroup close their quarter at the end of september wall street firms have been posting record profits in recent years fueled by strong markets they also have used their own money to trade and make long term investments also boosting profits but the firms have been burned by the recent shakeout in the market for risky or subprime mortgages they are facing the prospect of big losses on some investments the big brokerage firms engage in businesses varying from making loans to individual consumers to packaging loans into securities and selling them for big fees to investors like hedge funds these sorts of businesses eroded in the quarter and the woes have spilled over into other areas loans extended just a few months ago to help finance leveraged buyouts have in some cases dropped in value as a result the firms have had trouble packaging and selling them to investors the firms also have taken hits on securities backed by risky mortgages executives trying to close their books face a number of valuation and accounting issues foremost is how they should mark or value on their books investments in instruments that dont trade in active markets or where trading has dried up amid the market tumult securities under the spotlight include collateralized debt obligations financial instruments that often are backed by the subprime mortgages that have been hard hit making matters more difficult these valuation decisions are only rarely if ever announced investors may never find out the method behind the valuations "the real issue is how consistent will the firms be on the accounting treatment and we may never know as much of that is not immediately visible " said glenn schorr an analyst at ubs ag in some cases if a market price isnt readily available firms can fall back on valuation models those models though are based on a host of assumptions that can give executives latitude in determining values even if prices are available executives sometimes have leeway in choosing which to use the bid price the asking price or the midpoint between them some executives might be tempted to try to delay further marking of losing investments it is difficult but not impossible to do this by reclassifying loans or securities held on their books to do this firms must classify a loan or security to show they view it as an investment and plan to hold on to it until it matures which could take years "you are going to see an increase in the size of some of these accounts as firms decide to hang on to some of these loans or securities that have taken a hit " said ubss mr schorr still he thinks this will be unusual and banks will continue to mark the majority of their securities to market taking the losses as they occur reclassifying a loan as an investment would allow a firm to potentially avoid market losses on it down the road but firms would have to persuade their accountants they really do want to hold the loans and arent trying to avoid future losses said stephen ryan an associate professor of accounting at new york university when it comes to securities such as collateralized debt obligations firms face a different challenge they could reclassify a security as being held to maturity but once they have done this a firm cant turn around and sell the security to capture a change in the market without risking a drastic penalty affecting its entire balance sheet another wrinkle firms will have to decide whether the market downturn is permanent some executives may be tempted to argue the market correction is temporary and so they shouldnt face a long term write down of affected investments robin sidel contributed to this article see related article "tuesdays markets stock investors retreat in face of credit pinch turn
