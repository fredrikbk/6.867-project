reservoir of fear in china new risks emerge at giant three gorges dam scientists spot dangers in slides silt and algae cracks in a rice paddy miaohe village china chinas vaunted engineering marvel the three gorges dam drew fierce criticism during its construction for uprooting more than a million people and manhandling the yangtze river basin now a year after completion the project has new problems including landslides water pollution and suggestions that the dam could contribute to the very flooding it was built to prevent geologists say the massive weight of water behind the three gorges dam has begun to erode the yangtzes steep shores at several spots that along with frequent fluctuations in water levels has triggered a series of landslides and weakened the ground under places like miaohe a village about miles up the reservoir from the dam local officials worry that a whole mountainside here could collapse into the water killing residents and threatening a vital shipping lane there are additional dangers chinese scientists say that as the dam blocks silt heading downstream the yangtze river estuary region which includes shanghai is shrinking and sea water is coming further inland a report this spring by the world wildlife federation said water flowing through the dam is now moving faster damaging downriver dikes the urbanization that accompanied the dams construction led to more raw sewage and fertilizer runoff which collects in the reservoir rather than flushing downstream the emerging issues at three gorges illustrate this rapidly industrializing countrys efforts to control its environment and how the attempts to overcome them can worsen the problem in other areas of the world dam building has resulted in landslides or earthquakes set off by the weight of water in reservoirs here at the worlds largest hydroelectric project a center of chinas population and economy the consequences could be magnified questions about the yangtze are taking on added urgency as china grapples with a mounting water shortage across the country millions of tons of raw sewage industrial waste and fertilizer runoff have turned lakes into algae covered cesspools according to official statistics more than half of chinas major waterways are so polluted that fish are dying or water is unsafe for drinking or irrigation more than million people almost one quarter of the population lack access to clean drinking water the government says making things worse more than one third of the countrys or so reservoirs have "serious" structural problems according to the official xinhua news agency this spring a deputy minister of water resources called chinas reservoirs "time bombs" that could threaten the lives and property of those downstream in a dam collapse in henan province killed tens of thousands or more an incident that was covered up until recently chinas media is starting to cover problems at three gorges dam and its miles long reservoir the government hasnt spoken publicly about issues here but it has quietly rolled out a warning system for landslides and is supporting research to map out at risk regions officials are pouring money into water treatment plants and reinforcing about miles of riverbanks "we thought of all the possible issues " says environmental scientist weng lida the former head of the yangtze river water resources protection commission a government agency tasked with protecting the river basins water and environment he is now secretary general of the yangtze river forum a coalition of the chinese government and nongovernmental organizations that share research on the regions environment "but the problems are all more serious than we expected " the government agency that oversees the dam the changjiang water resources committee declined requests for an interview the changes can be seen here in miaohe where villagers have grown oranges from gnarled trees and farmed the areas steeply terraced rice paddies for generations miaohes or so residents narrowly avoided the mass relocations that accompanied the dams construction when some million people moved from their homes to make way for the reservoir this spring villagers noticed a crack some feet long and barely a half inch thick zigzagging across their paddies not long afterward dam officials lowered reservoir levels to prepare for the summer flooding season after early may rains raised reservoir levels again there were four landslides in five days not far from miaohe village villagers say they heard timbers in their houses began to split the government told them to evacuate officials in zigui city the county seat are facing a new wave of relocations some people in the county moved to make way for the reservoir now officials are concerned theyll have to relocate more "the changes have come faster than our plans " said cui shaofeng an official from the zigui county resettlement office the mile long yangtze is the worlds third longest river racing down from tibetan glaciers slicing massive valleys through the middle of china and passing fertile plains before its brown waters meet the sea on the way the river passes the three gorges a series of canyons that for centuries plagued sailors with swift currents and hidden rocks floods were a constant threat claiming victims by some estimates in the last century alone chinas leaders long dreamed of damming the yangtze in part to harness its power but primarily to prevent catastrophic flooding modern chinas founding father sun yat sen proposed a dam in mao zedong who believed nature could be shaped to mans purpose wrote a poem about turning the treacherous three gorges into a navigable lake from the late s the government approved and then delayed construction of a dam here several times hobbled by technical challenges by the late s china also faced mounting charges that a dam and reservoir would force mass relocations and destroy archeological sites and temples in april the government responded to criticism saying it would delay a decision for at least five years but opponents were silenced in the aftermath of tiananmen square crackdown in a few months later in scientists and engineers completed a final environmental feasibility study later that year the dam project was put to vote before the national peoples congress it passed but nearly one third of chinas usually docile legislature voted no or abstained an unusual show of dissent construction officially began in controversy continued responding to pressure from human rights groups the u s government and the world bank pulled support from the project in an open letter in leading engineers in china including some who had worked on the feasibility study protested a decision to fill the reservoir faster than originally planned the first trouble came in june two weeks after the yangtze river was impounded and the reservoir began to fill while water levels rose passing feet and approaching feet the valleys slopes started eroding under the pressure of the water on july a mountain on a tributary of the three gorges gave way shearing a tongue of land about two thirds of a mile wide and long and more than feet thick thirteen farmers were swept to their deaths in the mud and debris the wedge hit the water sending a two story tall wave crashing over boats drowning fishermen officials blamed the landslide on heavy rainfall geologists says a sudden change in water levels loosened rocks along the riverbanks with a final cost of at least &# billion the foot tall dam was finished in may once it is fully operational later this year it will contain five trillion gallons of water equivalent to one fifth of the fresh water consumed each year in the u s it will produce more than megawatts of electricity nearly times the capacity of hoover dam mr weng the environmental scientist believes the dam was necessary to stop floods his biggest concern now is the worsening quality of the reservoirs water phosphorus and nitrogen levels from industrial and fertilizer runoff have risen times above levels a decade ago according to the wwf report which he co edited the reservoir is filling with sewage as well waste water discharge has soared in the yangtze basin more than doubling from to the wwf report says the basin is home to some million people including million in the municipality of chongqing miles upstream from the dam in the years ending in the yangtze basin economy grew a year on average a percentage point faster than the rest of the nation as it has switched from agriculture to industry scientists and government officials say many sewage plants were built to process waste before it hits the reservoir but that some arent connected to city drains zhou wei vice director of the department of reservoir management at the governments three gorges project construction committee acknowledges that sewage levels in the reservoir appear to be increasing he says the government has given additional funds to make sure plants are running full time from the beginning engineers were also concerned about sedimentation the yangtze carries some million metric tons of silt into the gorges each year without a way to release most of this mud the reservoir would silt up and the dam could breach or collapse government engineers created sluice gates at the bottom of the dam to release turbid water during flood season and they estimate the system will keep the reservoir at roughly or more of its capacity for nearly a century some critics believe sedimentation is growing at a faster rate which could eventually make the dam unable to contain a flood crest downstream fluctuating sediment levels pose yet a different problem in water with little sediment sunlight reaches deeper and nourishes the photosynthetic algae which also feeds on sewage and fertilizer runoff mr weng says mr zhou the reservoir management vice director says the dam is not responsible for the blooms algae had turned out to be less of a concern than the three gorges committee had expected he says with only minor blooms in yangtze tributaries there are also concerns about whether the dam will control floods weeks of downpours in july created the biggest surges on the upper yangtze since when flooding on the undammed river killed thousands downstream officials announced on aug that the crest passed through the dam without incident critics say that while the dam can handle surges it may contribute to downstream flooding for an unforeseen reason past the narrow gorges where it enters central chinas broad plains the river traditionally slowed and in some places centuries of sedimentation raised the riverbed above the surrounding countryside and is held back by dikes as in new orleans water released by the dam runs faster the wwf says because the dams traps most of the silt lightened of its muddy load the water courses out with more force and threatens to gouge out these dikes geologists meanwhile are focusing on landslides the three gorges have a base of limestone but are layered in places with sandstone shale and mudstone softer materials that are more likely to collapse some areas were reinforced before the reservoir was filled but as dam officials raise and lower water levels in anticipation of floods the soaking and huge pressure changes leave banks weakened a team of scientists at the imperial college london said earlier this year that slope instability is the gorges"most widespread natural hazard " writing in the quarterly journal of engineering geology and hydrogeology published by the geological society of london they warned the problem is likely to get worse one of the authors looked at satellite readings of zigui wushan and badong counties with a combined population of more than a million people geologist ioannis fourniadis of imperial college london estimated that of the counties slopes are actively falling and are unstable for activities such as road building another were mostly stable the rest were solid limestone which he says pose extremely low risk a spokesman for chinas ministry of land resources blames this years high incidence of landslides on heavy rainfalls since spring he says the early warning system has detected some major slides and that the government is training local people to recognize landslide warning signs less than a mile from miaohe where a gravel road that provides sole access to the village passes through a muddy tunnel the villagers have set up temporary housing inside the tunnel they camp in plastic lean tos nearby the local government is clearing an area for the refugees to build new homes the government is providing money for homes but the villagers say it isnt enough the farmers will be able to grow rice oranges and tea here but they complain that the land isnt good the local government is providing families a dowry for their daughters to encourage them to marry out "this all started happening right after they began damming the river " says han qingxi years old pausing from rebuilding his simple stone home nearby backhoes level the mountainside "they say its safer here " he says zhou yang and kersten zhang in beijing contributed to this article
