politics &amp economics gonzales gone questions remain senators plan ways to get answers on surveillance attorney firings the three men on capitol hill who contributed the most to the downfall of attorney general alberto gonzales return from vacation next week with a short list of priorities that will likely keep the bush administration on the defensive instead of dulling the senate judiciary committees enthusiasm for investigating bush administration policy mr gonzaless resignation monday appears to have stoked it that is despite congresss low approval ratings and attempts by the white house to cast lawmakers as abdicating their legislative responsibilities new potential areas for conflict include the confirmation of mr gonzaless successor intelligence surveillance and the treatment of terrorism suspects sen patrick leahy the vermont democrat and chairman of the senate judiciary committee who led the investigation into the firings of several u s attorneys plans to hold hearings on the governments intelligence surveillance powers pennsylvanias arlen specter the top republican on the panel wants the administration to turn over more information on intelligence activities sen charles schumer the new york democrat who picked up a low wattage scrum over the attorney firings and turned it into a major investigation has called for a special prosecutor to investigate the ousters mr gonzales resigned after seven months in the spotlight following the firing of eight u s attorneys and accusations that the attorney general misled congress in sworn testimony after more than two dozen hearings and private interviews and the release of more than documents by the administration the origin of the idea to fire the attorneys last year remains unknown even as they marked the end of mr gonzaless tenure messrs leahy specter and schumer with the support of democrats and some republicans vowed to find out the extent of the white houses involvement in the firings mr schumer issued a gleeful press release on the gonzales resignation as the news was breaking monday morning yesterday he tried to sound conciliatory "the key to this is having an attorney general who will not stonewall and who will willingly get to the bottom of this " mr schumer said in a telephone interview "i think the departure of mr gonzales is a major helpful turn of events i think there are some questions that remain " said mr specter in a conference call from poland where he was on a visit when the gonzales resignation announcement came mr specter said he hoped to "work out a compromise with the white house" to allow for former senior staffer harriet miers and departing political adviser karl rove to testify about the u s attorney ousters mr specter initially refused to join the chorus seeking mr gonzaless ouster he grew more agitated at mr gonzaless incomplete responses to questions from members of congress just before the august recess he raised the prospect of the need for a new attorney general mr specters balancing act will make him a pivotal figure in the coming confirmation hearings for democrats the steady drumbeat of investigations could help them maintain the upper hand or at least to show voters they are accomplishing something even when some major legislation is vetoed oversight "is as important a function of the congress as legislation " said rep henry waxman the california democrat who as chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee has helped keep the spotlight on problems in the administration but the majority party also runs the political risk of having its investigations painted as a distraction from voter concerns according to the most recent wall street journal nbc news poll in june congress has a approval among those polled down from in april outside of congress some republicans are speculating that emboldened democrats want to make sure that mr gonzales isnt their only prize during the waning months of the bush presidency former supreme court nominee robert bork in a column published by national review online speculated that democrats might try to trade confirming a successor to mr gonzales for an independent investigation of various aspects of mr gonzaless tenure "senate democrats are surely contemplating making the confirmation of that person contingent upon the appointment of a special prosecutor " the former federal appeals court judge wrote "grand juries will be convened subpoenas issued witnesses badgered documents demanded from the white house and so on through the full repertoire of special prosecutors antics " mr schumer said yesterday he was willing to make peace with the white house though he isnt backing down from his request for a special prosecutor "the issue here is are we going to have an administration that reaches out and tries to work with us or are we going to have an administration that stands on mount olympus that hurls thunderbolts cause i got to tell you they dont have many more thunderbolts left " mr leahy is on vacation and was unavailable to comment yesterday an aide to the senator said he had declined to join mr schumer and other democrats request for a special prosecutor in a news conference monday mr leahy said he wanted the senate to live up to its constitutionally required "advice and consent" role in approving the next attorney general "sen specter and i working together could easily if the white house wanted give them a list of people who would have no problem being confirmed " mr leahy said "if they would like that advice the advice part of the advice and consent i think with such a short time left in the administration theyd be well advised to seek that " a senior administration official warned it would be wrong for congressional democrats to condition a confirmation vote on the appointment of a special prosecutor "a decision to appoint a special prosecutor should not be a matter of cutting a political deal " the official said "it would be inappropriate for the president to make a nomination in exchange for someones commitment on the question of a special prosecutor and it would be inappropriate for senators to cast a confirmation vote in exchange for someones commitment on a special prosecutor " mr leahy also may open new areas of confrontation with the administration by pushing for congress to approve granting detained terrorism suspects the right to court trials which the administration and most republicans oppose mr leahys aides suggest they have the senate votes required to push the issue to the forefront
