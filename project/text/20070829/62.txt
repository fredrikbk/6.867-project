in hunt for zombies columnist finds its not so scary after all with the computer world said to be in the middle of a zombie invasion i thought it would be instructive to trap one inside my pc it was harder than i might have thought when a computer is turned into a zombie it sends your personal information back to a hacker or becomes part of a collection of "bots" under the control of remote hackers who often use them to send out spam computers become thus afflicted through various hijacker programs via spam emails or by visiting hacker web sites that take advantages of security loopholes in your browser on the prowl for zombies i started with the spam folder of one of my email accounts it contained around emails the usual promises of physical financial and pharmaceutical enhancement id open each message then click on any link it had i wouldnt though click "yes" to any request for a program to be downloaded and i wouldnt use any special security software just a fully patched version of microsofts windows xp and internet explorer the latter with its default security settings in place dont try this at home simply opening spam email from strangers with subject lines like "ladies will love you" is not something beginners should try taking the next step clicking on the links inside those emails is a task only for highly trained columnists when it was all over i ran an antivirus program several actually no zombies there wasnt even evidence of spyware just some cookies the sort used by even reputable sites i was surprised but weve all forgotten that this is the way the web is supposed to work you should be able to visit web sites without downloading any software and exit without harm does this mean there arent any dangers out there hardly remember i ran the test using internet explorer with its default security settings but like many people i usually do my web business with less cautious settings to avoid the inconvenience of having to repeatedly give the browser explicit permission to do something when i reran the experiment with these more relaxed settings there was trouble indeed i ended up infected with a high risk trojan one that could easily have ended up making a zombie of my pc a bracing bit of news as a result what were once my regular browser settings are now my ex regular settings i know where the infection was from too its common for the links in spam emails to pretend to be sending you to one site but to actually send you somewhere else you might for example think youre clicking on a youtube video when it fact youre going to a hacker site that will try to exploit a bug to plant some malware on your machine even more disturbingly the most popular hacker scams these days like fake greeting cards usually prompt you to download a file under the pretense of needing to install a special viewer or they might report that you need a microsoft security patch in either case once youve loaded a hackers program youre susceptible to anything of course its not a good idea to go anywhere online without some security software had a program been installed during my tests it would have screamed holy heck before it let me download that trojan its hardly news that one encounters malefactors in the scummiest parts of the web some web security companies though say its much worse than that in the course of my research i called several security companies for help symantec called back with a hot tip company researchers with a brand new pc had spent a day visiting only well known respectable web sites but had still managed to attract a number of zombie programs in other words trouble also awaits you in the webs most glamorous neighborhoods a public relations person sent along a spreadsheet detailing the research it showed for example the names of five auction sites some famous where two zombie programs had been encountered the very sort tracked by one of symantecs new programs that innocent shoppers could be so exposed was alarming you can imagine the headline "web more dangerous than your wildest dreams web security software firm says " because security companies are often accused of exaggerating web threats it wont surprise too many people to learn that the situation wasnt exactly what symantec suggested it turns out symantec researchers merely started at those five sites they then proceeded to click around downloading programs as they went but they didnt keep records of where they went or how far from the original sites one link away they had strayed in other words they could have been anywhere on the web a scare tactic no said the company it was just trying to demonstrate the risks of going without security software by showing what might happen to an average web user "we would not want this data to be taken out of context or used as fear mongering " email me at lee gomes wsj com
