not so hot the latest twist in the global warming saga is the revision in data at nasas goddard institute for space studies indicating that the warmest year on record for the u s was not but rather by of a degree celsius canadian and amateur climate researcher stephen mcintyre discovered that nasa made a technical error in standardizing the weather air temperature data post these temperature mistakes were only for the u s their net effect was to lower the average temperature reading from by c the new data undermine another frightful talking point from environmentalists which is that six of the hottest years on record have occurred since wrong nasa now says six of the warmest years were in the s and s and that was before the bulk of industrial co emissions were released into the atmosphere those are the new facts whats hard to know is how much if any significance to read into them nasa officials say the revisions are insignificant and should not be "used by global warming critics to muddy the debate " nasa scientist gavin schmidt notes that despite the revisions the period is still warmer for the u s than and both periods are slightly cooler than still environmentalists have been making great hay by claiming that recent years such as then were the "warmest" on record its also not clear that the degree temperature revision is as trivial as nasa insists total u s warming since has been about degrees celsius this means that a error for recent years is more than two thirds the observed temperature increase for the period of warming nasa counters that most of the measured planetary warming in recent decades has occurred outside the u s and that the agencys recent error would have a tiny impact th of a degree on global warming if nothing else the snafu calls into question how much faith to put in climate change models in the s virtually all climate models predicted warming from but the new data confirm that so far there has been no warming trend in this decade for the u s whoops these simulation models are the basis for many of the forecasts of catastrophic warming by the end of the century that al gore and the media repeat time and again we may soon be basing multi trillion dollar policy decisions on computer models whose accuracy we already know to be less than stellar whats more disturbing is what this incident tells us about the scientific double standard in the global warming debate if this kind of error were made by climatologists who dare to challenge climate change orthodoxy the media and environmentalists would accuse them of manipulating data to distort scientific truth nasas blunder only became a news story after internet bloggers played whistleblower by circulating the new data across the web so far this year nasa has issued at least five press releases that could be described as alarming on the pace of climate change but the correction of its overestimate of global warming was merely posted on the agencys web site james hansen nasas ubiquitous climate scientist and a man who has charged that the bush administration is censoring him on global warming has been unapologetic about nasas screw up he claims that global warming skeptics "court jesters " he calls them are exploiting this incident to "confuse the public about the status of knowledge of global climate change thus delaying effective action to mitigate climate change " so lets get this straight mr hansens agency makes a mistake in a way that exaggerates the extent of warming and this is all part of a conspiracy by "skeptics" its a wonder there arent more of them
