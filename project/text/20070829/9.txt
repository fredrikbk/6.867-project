ahead of the tape tight course lies ahead for bernanke forget about scylla and charybdis in the next few days federal reserve chairman ben bernanke has to set a course between market mayhem and the "greenspan put " the greenspan put is the idea that in times of crisis the fed will step in to bail out financial market participants with lower interest rates as it did in response to the russian debt crisis in when alan greenspan was at its helm the term was coined in early by credit suisse trader steve kim then a derivatives analyst at merrill lynch and popularized by pimco economist and fund manager paul mcculley a put option insures investors against losses both men felt that the belief the fed would similarly insure investors against losses whenever markets got rocky encouraged risky investment behavior with markets again in turmoil theres been a cry from some wall streeters and corporate head honchos lately for the fed to lower short term interest rates to settle frayed nerves the fed took a step in that direction this month when it lowered rates on borrowing from its discount window the more widely used federal funds market could be next fed funds futures contracts which price off of interest rate expectations show investors are nearly certain the fed will cut its target fed funds rate by a quarter point to next month but as they head off to their annual symposium at jackson hole wyo this weekend fed officials may try to disabuse wall street of the notion as ing investment management economic advisor jim griffin recently put it the fed "doesnt want to embed a bernanke put in market mythology or otherwise validate the irresponsible lending that produced the current mess " a philip morris spinoff would only buy time the board of marlboro cigarette maker altria group is widely expected to announce a spinoff of its philip morris international division after a directors meeting today such an announcement will likely give the companys stock a nice pop the longer term prospects for investors are more smoky the idea is to free the overseas unit from its lumbering philip morris usa twin which is burdened with legal and regulatory issues high taxes and a dwindling market as americans quit smoking altrias overseas operations have been the companys prime growth engine in the second quarter cigarette volumes at philip morris usa fell from a year earlier international cigarette volumes rose morningstar estimates domestic cigarette sales volumes will decline by to a year over the next years while overseas volumes should climb by the same amount the stock of a spun off international unit could put up hefty gains for a while but one has to wonder whether an altria restructuring will be anything more than cosmetic in the long run a bet on international growth amounts to a bet that smokers and policy makers in places like asia and the middle east where smoking has been increasing wont soon figure out what smokers and policy makers in the u s western europe and latin america have figured out cigarettes are deadly and it pays to quit scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
