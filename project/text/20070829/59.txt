hispanics hard times hit wal mart results of u s housing slump are felt on both sides of border with mexico dallas martin zamorano a cement worker and wal mart shopper frequently used money transfers to send &# to &# at a time to his year old mother in the tiny town of chinanpas in central mexico now with local home construction down precipitously from a year ago he can no longer afford to send even a modest amount instead mr zamorano has been sending cans of peas and corn packaged soups and other foods to his mother through a relative who visits chinanpas frequently "work has dried up " said mr zamorano years old as he perused the grocery section of a wal mart near the heavily hispanic oak cliff section of dallas "its been very rainy and there havent been a lot of projects " mr zamoranos plight presents a challenge to wal mart stores inc on both sides of the u s mexican border the worlds biggest retailer by sales has increasingly relied on purchases by hispanic shoppers both in the u s and in mexico to fuel its sales growth in particular wal mart has sought to draw mexican and mexican american customers in the u s who send money to relatives in mexico using the retailers growing wire transfer business the relatives then have the opportunity to stock up while at their local wal mart operated store but economic jitters in particular the softening u s housing market have led to spending cutbacks among many in that group estimating the impact on a group as large and varied as hispanics is difficult but economists at deutsche bank estimate about illegal hispanic workers in construction have lost their jobs last year without showing up in government figures the industry is heavily hispanic legal or illegal the group makes up or million of the million workers in the u s construction industry according to the pew hispanic center with about three quarters of them foreign born "theres less work " says jesus manuel vazquez a sheetrock installer in dallas who sends money to his mother in law in the state of chihuahua in northern mexico every days but recently has cut back economists cite the housing market among other factors for a drop in those money transfers the mexican central bank estimates that money transfers into the country have risen so far this year compared with a robust increase last year and the year prior money transfers from the u s are

names among others in addition to its flagship wal mart brand has become the largest retailer by sales by offering a low cost alternative to relatively inefficient mexican retailers walmex racked up &# billion in sales last year accounting for nearly a quarter of the retailers international sales and ranking it as wal marts second largest international division behind its asda unit in the united kingdom the retailer has responded to the slowdown by cutting its spending on advertising and marketing eliminating jobs at its headquarters and slashing prices on a new round of products on aug the money transfer slowdown is but one of several factors hampering the mexican economy most importantly u s demand for goods manufactured in mexico cars auto parts and consumer electronics among others has eased "definitely the slowdown in the u s economy in the first quarter triggered a slowdown in mexican growth " said rafael amiel a managing director in philadelphia for global insight in the u s the hit to many hispanic shoppers adds to a host of other factors like higher gasoline prices and wal marts own failed foray into trendy apparel and home decor that have limited wal marts sales at established u s stores to a paltry gain in its fiscal second quarter in its home market wal mart has wooed mexican immigrants and mexican americans with a combination of low prices on clothes and groceries and a growing array of services such as low cost money transfers check cashing and prepaid visa cards aimed at people without bank accounts an estimated of wal marts u s shoppers were
