desperate house loans subprime mortgages dominate the economic news they have pushed &# a gallon gas off the front pages and completely obscured the national unemployment rate and the economic expansion that has now lasted five years and is the fourth longest since world war ii the common view seems to be that the roof is falling in not just in the subprime market but in the entire housing sector and beyond into the american and even the world economy as the financial markets worry about who holds what tranches of subprime mortgage backed securities we are losing track of the underlying problem what is actually happening to subprime borrowers and what is likely to happen the subprime market is new and it has grown very fast it barely existed years ago but accounted for of mortgage originations last year and as it grew it changed ten years ago subprime loans were basically either refinances or debt consolidation fewer than were used to buy homes in addition loan to value ratios were substantially lower than in the conventional prime market typically no more than subprime lenders knew they were taking a great deal of risk and they wanted protection against loss as much as possible five years ago home purchase loans were about one third of subprime originations and ltvs were higher but still nearly all were or less in the last few years as the home purchase share rose to subprime lenders relaxed underwriting standards and offered mortgages with very high ltvs mortgages with little or no documented evidence of the borrowers ability to pay and adjustable rate mortgages with built in large increases in the monthly payment after two or three years those risks are now coming home to roost the risks are limited however they are concentrated in the mortgages originated during loans originated in and earlier pose no unusual problem those loans were less risky and those borrowers have enjoyed the double digit home price appreciation of and many have been able to refinance into conventional mortgages with better terms recent history suggests that these risks are manageable subprime delinquencies and foreclosures have risen sharply this year but they are still below the rates reached during the mortgage bankers association reports that about of subprime loans were seriously delinquent days or more in and the first half of so far this year about are delinquent the foreclosure rate has climbed from at the end of to during serious delinquencies were about and foreclosures ranged from to rates could go higher over the next couple of years the foreclosures in occurred on loans that were less risky than the loans of the last few years the point is that we have been here before and not that long ago most importantly delinquencies and especially foreclosures on prime mortgages remained low during consistently around for serious delinquencies and for foreclosures the subprime spike had no impact on the prime market then there is no reason to expect one this time the delinquency rate has again been stable so far while foreclosures have edged up to from as the subprime problem has worsened the financial regulators have been encouraging forbearance their joint statement in april asked lenders "to work constructively" with homeowners who cannot make their mortgage payments and to "consider prudent workout arrangements that increase the potential for financially stressed residential borrowers to keep their homes " the regulators are right the evidence suggests that forbearance works the federal housing administration which insures mortgages to many borrowers with less than perfect credit began a forbearance program in lenders try to work out a modified repayment plan if there seems to be a realistic chance that the borrower can catch up often there is a realistic chance in the fhas experience about half the borrowers in the program do become current within a year if the lenders and the regulators follow through they can ease the problem substantially in addition the underlying economic trends are favorable to homeowners this may seem a surprising statement when interest rates have been rising and housing starts have fallen by one third in a year the sharpest drop since the census bureau began publishing monthly data in but the relevant indicator is house prices if they are rising subprime borrowers have a chance to build some equity in their home before they confront higher mortgage payments everyone knows that the "housing bubble" has burst like the tulip bubble of the th century the south sea bubble of the th century and of course the dot com bubble yet prices are still rising on average the best measure of house prices is the index produced by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight based on the millions of loans purchased by fannie mae and freddie mac over more than years the index shows that prices continue to increase as they have in every quarter since over the past year prices have risen by about much more slowly than the double digits of but still an increase four percent is a national average and all housing markets are local about of u s metropolitan areas out of have seen a price decline of or more a slow leak at most this is an odd sort of bubble with prices rising in most places and falling slightly in some it is certainly not the pattern of the nasdaq composite index between and the rise in subprime foreclosures is real and likely to be large many homeowners will find themselves in over their head with loans whose terms they do not really understand these are real families who are losing their homes if they have been making their payments for a couple of years they are also losing the equity they have built up plus any price appreciation from a policy standpoint the subprime problem is certainly serious but it is a short term problem mainly involving mortgages originated in the last three years and playing out over the next two years or so it will be mitigated by public and private efforts to help the families in distress there is no reason for it to spread to the prime market homeowners who are able to make their payments are not going to lose their homes because other homeowners are losing theirs the roof is not caving in on housing mr weicher is director of the center for housing and financial markets at the hudson institute from to he was assistant secretary for housing and federal housing commissioner at the u s department of housing and urban development
