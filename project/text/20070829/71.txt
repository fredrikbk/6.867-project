me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q my sister plans to consider the mazda speed hatchback and the subaru impreza turbo hatchback as her next car we are debating the subarus all wheel drive compared with the front wheel drive mazda is one better than another at handling the performance ive always reasoned that all wheel drive or rear wheel drive is better for performance does all wheel drive also benefit drivers in rain others keep telling us that snow is the only reason to consider it an advantage is that true carrie noxon houston a both cars are fun to drive and surprisingly fast but i think the subaru is a better balanced car that will be more pleasant to live with over the long term in general small front wheel drive cars with a lot of horsepower feel sloppy during rapid acceleration because the wheels are overwhelmed with having to steer the car and direct the engines power to the pavement as the car moves forward from a stop its weight transfers rearward making the front end "light" and increasing the likelihood of the wheels spinning if traction is unevenly split between the front wheels the car may veer back and forth driving enthusiasts call the effect "torque steer" all wheel drive distributes power more evenly and seems to largely cure the problems of overpowered small cars the subaru has also been on the market longer and has therefore benefited from years of incremental development i think chances are better with the subaru because the bugs have been worked out q i am a single woman who is afraid to buy tires the last time i went to a tire dealer i felt ripped off because the final price was higher than i expected there seem to be fees for everything involved not just the tires where should i purchase tires i am not asking for the name of a specific store just some general guidance the "tire specialist" stores dont seem like a good bet pat mcmurray washington a your local mechanic may be the best source tire specialists are good for car enthusiasts seeking particular brands or types but i usually wind up at my local family run tire store the shop i use sells tires and performs general services like oil changes tune ups and repairs if i want a specific tire the proprietor can order it but he also answers questions and makes reasonable recommendations i think independent all around service outlets are less likely to sell you more tire than you need if you dont have a regular mechanic you might ask acquaintances where they get vehicles serviced or where they buy tires and if they have been consistently satisfied questions can be e mailed to mecar wsj com
