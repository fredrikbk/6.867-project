credit crunch the man who saw it coming sounding the subprime alarm in investors should sell all exposure to the american mortgage securities market " advised greed &amp fear a weekly note to clients from stock strategist christopher wood pretty conventional advice these days yes but this warning from mr wood was sounded in october the collapse of prices for u s mortgage backed securities has sent a jolt through global financial markets in recent weeks among the people who shouldnt have been surprised those familiar with the writings of mr wood the stock strategist for hong kong based brokerage clsa asia pacific markets majority owned by french bank credit agricole in he was warning that u s mortgage debt was "where the credit risk lies in the american and global financial system " mr wood wasnt the only person to have seen trouble in the rise of riskier lending and investing practices in the u s in recent years but few have been quite as specific in focusing on the financial implications of the u s housing bubble particularly the use of securitization in which mortgages and other loans are repackaged and sold to investors mark mobius who oversees emerging markets portfolios at templeton asset management remembers a lunch with mr wood as long as a year ago at which the strategist mentioned his concerns about the u s housing market and its potential impact on the global financial system "he was certainly spot on " mr mobius says "it was amazing " mr woods ideas made him think that the u s economy might be at greater risk of a slowdown than people generally acknowledged "it made us cautious on stocks that would be sensitive to exports to the u s " he says "it was helpful " mr wood has diagnosed the end of bubbles before the british born former journalist urged investors to sell just as the nasdaq stock market wave was about to crest in early and he sounded the alarm on thailands woes soon before its currency devaluation helped spark the asian financial crisis mr woods fascination with financial frothiness goes back many years his first book published in during his decade long stint writing for the economist magazine was called "boom and bust the rise and fall of world financial markets " he was a correspondent in japan for the economist around the time of that countrys economic collapse after the highflying s and wrote one of the earliest books deconstructing it "the bubble economy " published in mr wood has been publishing greed &amp fear since taking it with him as he moved to several different investment banks he joined clsa in the firm was co founded in by credit lyonnais which later merged with credit agricole the weekly note which runs about pages in an average edition now has almost readers most of them clients of clsa mr wood who makes his home in jakarta but spends about months of the year traveling usually writes on the road with a new dateline almost every week his predictions arent always on the mark or perfectly timed "if id been running money id probably have been short too early" on u s mortgage backed securities he said last week during a phone call from india his main focus is writing about stocks in asia where clsa does most of its business but he has been criticizing the spread of securitization in the u s for years with characteristic bluntness "the american financial system remains a giant laboratory experiment in securitization which has not yet been properly stress tested on the downside " he wrote in february after urging investors to cut their exposure to securities related to u s mortgages in late he continued to warn about securitization through last year in august as the u s housing market was slowing he warned that "the markets have yet to focus on the resulting inevitable credit problems this credit aspect to the housing problem will come later in the cycle and will provide the stress test of securitization " then this january "it is increasingly clear that the achilles heel of the u s housing market lies in the subprime mortgage area this might seem a niche segment but it is actually rather large and has potentially macro consequences " in late february global stock markets first caught up with that idea worsening problems among subprime mortgage lenders led to a sudden selloff on wall street that pushed the dow jones industrial average down points mr woods take on the current crisis isnt encouraging "in the credit world i think weve been in a bubble every bit as big as the one in technology in and in japan in the s " he says the chief culprit mr wood believes is securitization which he thinks "has been basically running amok" in the u s in recent years securitization in the housing market he says has led investors to ignore legitimate financial risk by pretending that it is too spread out to matter still mr wood doesnt think all bubbles are bad another one is brewing in the asset prices of asia and other emerging markets he believes adding that it is still early in a cycle that will run for years while stock prices in asia may continue to be volatile because of the u s credit market and housing market issues in the long term "were going to go into new bubble territory in these markets " he says "in the big picture its a buying opportunity "
