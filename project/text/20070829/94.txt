schering plough merck plan combined pill claritin singulair medication firms second joint venture reflects wide industry interest schering plough corp and merck &amp co announced plans to combine the popular allergy drugs claritin and singulair into a single pill in a bid to offer a new treatment option for allergy sufferers the initiative breathes new life into a project that stalled five years ago after the two companies research failed to show the combination pill was better for seasonal allergy patients than the two pills administered separately now the companies say the combined product offers relief from sneezing runny nose and watery eyes associated with allergies and also from nasal congestion the "consistent and clinically relevant effect on congestion" they now see with the combined treatment "was not demonstrated with the individual components " they said in an interview last week thomas koestler schering ploughs head of research and development said the combination product had "stalled " but that the company "took a hard look at this" and felt it made sense to move forward the companies said they have filed for food and drug administration approval of the new pill the application was accepted for a standard review which typically takes to months according to the agency but in a crowded allergy market that includes dozens of generic and over the counter options schering plough and merck would likely have to make the case to potential customers that the drug is an advance over other products that are already available including singulair and claritin taken separately singulair is available only as a branded drug with blockbuster sales of &# billion last year claritin is available both generically and over the counter the combo pills advantages will especially be a question because merck and schering plough said in a press release that a late stage study "did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis compared to each product administered separately " both companies declined to elaborate on what has changed since but said data on the combination drug would be available at an unspecified future date "i think they sort of looked a little harder at the data and figured out a way to make it look good " says harold nelson an allergist at national jewish medical and research center in denver "this is not a huge therapeutic breakthrough " however dr nelson added that a potential benefit of the product would be if it is shown to address the "whole spectrum" of allergy symptoms including congestion while having a benign side effect profile many currently available products arent "as effective as we might hope they would be " he said dr nelson is doing research on behalf of schering plough on its asthma drug asmanex the effort is the second major joint venture between the two big pharmaceutical companies and it reflects broader industry interest in combining popular medicines into one pill ideally the strategy offers convenience improved compliance with medications and possibly lower co pays for patients for companies it can salvage a revenue stream from drugs that have gone off patent among other things merck and schering plough sell vytorin a pill that combines mercks cholesterol fighter zocor now available generically as simvastatin and schering ploughs zetia sales of vytorin were &# billion in nearly double the figures for the prior year according to merck but pfizer inc s caduet a drug combining the cholesterol drug lipitor and the high blood pressure medicine norvasc has yielded disappointing sales nitromed inc s bid to sell bidil a branded version of two generic pills for heart failure to african american patients has met stiff resistance because the combination is much more expensive with little evidence of improved benefit in the revived venture of schering plough and merck claritin is an antihistamine that treats allergy symptoms such as sneezing runny nose and itchy watery eyes but not congestion singulair meanwhile also may help with congestion doctors say the drug isnt approved specifically as a treatment for congestion though the drugs label says patients who took it improved on a "nasal symptom score" that included congestion as a component singulair is also approved for treatment of asthma if the combo pill is approved doctors and patients would have to weigh whether it offers an advantage over other antihistamines that have added the decongestant component pseudoephedrine such as claritin d which is available over the counter sudafed which contains pseudoephedrine and could be taken along with an antihistamine is also available over the counter robert naclerio chief of otolaryngology ear nose and throat medicine and head and neck surgery at the university of chicago says that with a congestion benefit a claritin singulair pill might also appeal to patients because it has fewer side effects pseudoephedrine can cause restlessness and insomnia in some patients and some have reported elevated heart rates dr naclerio says he has provided consulting services to merck and schering plough on the combination product dr naclerio says the most effective treatments for allergy symptoms meanwhile are steroid nasal sprays such as schering ploughs nasonex and glaxosmithkline plcs flonase but he says many patients dont like using nasal sprays schering plough might see some gains from the project since sales of branded claritin once a &# billion product have plunged as the drug became generic several years ago the &# billion sales of singulair mercks top selling product represented a increase over singulair isnt expected to become available generically until according to lehman brothers a risk for merck is that sales of the combination pill would cut into sales of singulair sales of the combination product would be shared by the two companies merck spokesman ian mcconnell said the company recognizes the combination pill would compete with singulair but that merck is "pleased" to be "moving forward in this market " the combination pill would "provide another alternative for patients and caregivers " he said
