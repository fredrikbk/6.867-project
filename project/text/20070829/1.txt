a cultural conversation with moshe safdie hes a revisionist modernist somerville mass after years in the architectural wilderness moshe safdie isnt about to feign modesty now tanned and vigorous with a white shirt and white mustache he whirls a visitor through rooms filled with sketches and models for projects on three continents front and center is the &# billion acre marina bay sands casino development on singapores waterfront with its cantilevered sky park and artscience museum but mr safdie is also jazzed about the u s institute of peace headquarters about to break ground on washingtons mall khalsa heritage memorial complex a sikh history museum nearing completion outside chandigarh india crystal bridges museum of american art in bentonville ark and the free library of philadelphia expansion featuring another of his signature light flooded "urban rooms " the year old architect points out a sheet of moshe safdie stamps from canada a testament to his increasing stature two of his projects ben gurion international airport and the yitzhak rabin center both in tel aviv already have graced israeli stamps "no u s stamps yet " he notes like his mentor louis i kahn mr safdie has led a nomadic life born in haifa israel and educated in montreal he burst onto the architectural scene with habitat a montreal apartment building made of asymmetrically stacked prefabricated concrete cubes decorated with skylights and roof gardens hailed as an innovative prescription for urban living habitat was the centerpiece of expo and landed mr safdie on the cover of newsweek in when he was it was recently designated a municipal heritage landmark and today marks its th anniversary being celebrated by a reunion of its residents past and present including mr safdie himself after early success "you then have this syndrome of can you live up to what youve done as a wunderkind " mr safdie says "which isnt easy because the expectations are extraordinary and the opportunities are not automatically there "i struggled " mr safdie says "first of all i did several habitats that never got built so that was depressing the s were tough years for me in the s i designed columbus center which i thought was a breakthrough high rise building in new york and that didnt go through which was heartbreaking " the project meant to replace the new york coliseum at columbus circle was criticized "both stylistically its not being postmodern enough and because of its mass " he says the site is now occupied by the twin story glass towers of skidmore owings &amp merrills time warner center in mr safdie moved to massachusetts to head harvards urban design program he retained a branch office in jerusalem where he had helped reconstruct the old city and was rebuilding the blighted area of mamilla later he would become the master planner for a new israeli city modiin for residents in the s and s canadian commissions finally began to roll in the national gallery of canada in ottawa the quebec museum of civilization vancouver library square vancouver was followed by the salt lake city public library in with its soaring glass enclosed public spaces two years later mr safdie completed the new yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem "how you get work is strange " he says the singapore project resulted from an encounter with sheldon adelson board chairman of the las vegas sands corp at the yad vashem opening "think of the improbability of a casino tourist complex coming out of a holocaust museum " says mr safdie moshe safdie &amp associates with about employees is a medium size firm but mr safdie says he is the lead designer of every project and remains involved as did kahn from concept to completion "and i think that makes our buildings richer more technologically oriented more sustainable more energy conscious " he says his contribution is not simply "pictorial" or "formal " as it is in some practices "which is in a way an indirect critique of some of architecture today " he says in mr safdie roiled the profession with an article in the atlantic monthly linking architectural postmodernism a reaction to the stripped down industrial aesthetic of the modernist glass box that included a return to ornamentation and references to historical styles to "the rise of narcissism the hunger for novelty and deep pessimism " now he says he tries to couch his views in positive terms "but i do think that theres a lot of capricious form making out there that much i can say " mr safdie positions himself along with renzo piano and norman foster as a revisionist modernist "we grew out of modernism " he says "and we evolved it further we made it more contextual we expanded its technological base and we started dealing with the sensual and symbolic aspects that modernism tended to avoid altogether it was very puritanical " the revisionists also are more ecologically conscious and have "a much more highly developed sense of the individual " he says "because modernism was kind of bolshevik in some ways their sense of equality was that everybodys the same " mr safdie draws a distinction between postmodernist historicism which he has called "a bag of tricks " and his own sensitivity to landscape and culture "people are critical of me sometimes for the fact that they cant quite pin me down stylistically " he says "but for me building in india is just such a different experience than building in bentonville the cultural context has such an impact on what i do " many of his commissions including yad vashem the sikh museum and the peace institute carry a symbolic charge a challenge he relishes "although unlike some colleagues " he says "i never try and explain the symbolic moves because i think they are totally subject to personal meanings " is this a sly jab at daniel libeskind who delighted in explicating the symbolic underpinnings of his jewish museum in berlin "you mentioned the name not me " mr safdie replies at yad vashem mr safdies own symbolism proved controversial "theres an aggressive cut into the mountain " which then "bursts out to the light " he says "after youve seen the horror story its a reaffirmation of life and youre looking at the forest which is certainly a metaphor for the rebirth of israel " he adds "i had to fight for this not everybody on the yad vashem board thought this optimistic gesture was the right thing to do " given his skepticism of grand sculptural architecture mr safdies endorsement of frank gehrys guggenheim bilbao comes as something of a surprise "bilbao is a great joyous celebration " says mr safdie who counts mr gehry as a friend "its a little bit like the sydney opera house where its imagery is strong enough to start standing for something beyond itself when that happens its quite wonderful " still "its not a model for what i want to do " at crystal bridges which is being funded by wal mart heiress alice walton "the exhibits and the architecture were conceived together " he says when the museum opens in late its wood and glass pavilions will both bridge and border two ponds fed by natural springs the museum will be surrounded by woods and linked by a pedestrian walkway to bentonvilles downtown the goal is to "make the experiencing of nature at its best and of the art an inseparable continuous journey " the architect says mr safdie is positioned at an interesting nexus between bentonville and philadelphia the city whose two major art museums raised enough money last december to keep thomas eakinss magisterial painting "the gross clinic " from being sold by thomas jefferson medical college to crystal bridges and the national gallery of art in washington "i was actually amazed " says mr safdie begging philadelphia donors for library project funds was "like bringing water out of the rock to use a biblical symbol " he says "all of a sudden alice walton buys the painting and within a week they raise &# million " the money didnt materialize quite that fast and the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts had to sell another eakins "the cello player " to help finance the &# million acquisition but that doesnt obviate mr safdies point "in one case youre talking about a library that will serve thousands of kids and young people and the public at large and clearly libraries serve above all the less privileged and in the other case its a painting and look how much more response there was it just was a shocking juxtaposition " for mr safdie architecture is above all a humanistic undertaking he offers the example of a "mega hospital" he is designing in montreal where he aims to create "a sense of well being" using space and light "as i shape the building " he says "i have to become a patient i have to become a doctor i have to become a nurse completely the more i manage to be them the more humane and relevant the solution will be which is what kahn i think meant when he said what does a building want to be "and you know i wont mention names that some of the sculptural architects of the day would never even talk about it " he adds "theyre just expressive creative artists and thats the sad part that the avant garde is fundamentally into architecture as high expressive art but at the expense of being more rooted in the very purpose of why a building is being built " ms klein is a cultural reporter and critic in philadelphia
