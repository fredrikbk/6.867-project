class of logs slide in sat scores in year with record number of test takers math results show worst drop in decades with results that will hardly put to rest the controversy over the merits of the sat scores for the high school class of are in and theyre down the point drop in the average math score for the latest year was the biggest in more than three decades reported the college board the new york nonprofit that administers the college admissions test math scores declined three points to from the previous years out of a possible critical reading formerly called "verbal" also dropped to from marking the lowest score since scores for the writing section slipped to from the previous year the first time the new sections scores were released taken together the scores are the lowest of the decade so far the college board says the latest group of test takers was the largest and most diverse ever which may be reflected in the lower average scores wayne camara the college boards vice president for research and analysis said that even so the decline was "not statistically significant " but a number of educators college admissions experts and students say the scores reflect deeper problems with the test itself a revised test was introduced in march which added more algebra and reading passages and a new section that tests writing skills and some testing experts say the reason for the drop is simple the new test is harder and too long "the new test was designed to be more challenging " says seppy basili senior vice president at kaplan inc the test prep concern owned by washington post co the inclusion of material from advanced algebra is "a serious concern for some students " he says some of whom dont reach the material until their junior year the revisions to the test also added minutes to the length "it is a problem " says scott white director of guidance at montclair high school montclair n j "there is no way on earth a kid can test for nearly four hours and have the same level of attention and acuity as with a three hour test " andrew bennett jackson a senior at montclair says he found his "focus really go down" toward the end of the exam which he took over the summer he scored a out of a possible he plans on trying the act a rival admissions test accepted by a growing number of schools in the fall one big plus the acts writing section is optional which makes it shorter for students who just want to retake the other two sections "it just makes the test a little bit easier " mr bennett jackson says math scores in the sat have for the most part risen over the past decade peaking at in before starting a downward trend along with the new test by comparison reading scores have remained relatively steady in the low s in that period the college board has been subject to a range of criticism over the revised test in addition to the concerns about length some critics have objected to the subjective nature of scoring a written exam and last year the college board took some blows after about students were wrongly scored too low last week the board announced a settlement in which it and ncs pearson inc which scanned the answer sheets will pay &# million to the test takers and their lawyers in recent years a number of schools have moved away from requiring the test still the test is enormously influential and is taken by many students headed to elite competitive schools laurence bunin senior vice president for operations at the college board says that this year the college board is "absolutely confident in the scores " mr white and other guidance counselors have asked the college board to consider allowing students to retake the exam section by section james montoya a college board vice president says "that approach is not one we are giving further consideration to at this time " he added though that the board is looking at ways to shorten the "test day" experience for instance by streamlining some of the administrative components the college board dismissed criticism that the test is harder saying the new test was carefully constructed for its math and reading sections to be comparable with those sections before the revisions for instance while some subjects such as advanced algebra were introduced others such as word analogies were eliminated officials also say that research done last year showed no difference in student performance at the beginning middle and end of the test the college board pointed out that a record number of students took the test in the most recent year million up from the previous year it added that minority students made up a record of test takers the class of also reflects the nations growing immigrant population nearly a quarter of test takers didnt list english as their only first language up from years earlier the overall increase in test takers may be bringing the average down the college board says maine for instance now requires all high school students to take the sat pointed out mr bunin mr basili of kaplan says "when youre increasing participation youre going to decrease scores" since it means "reaching deeper into the pool to students that would normally not be going to college " among the surprises in the results the test takers reported as being among the wealthiest were one of the groups that saw the biggest declines students with family incomes of more than &# saw declines in all three sections combined of points from the previous years scores by contrast the only income group that actually saw increases were those with reported incomes between &# and &# in that group there were increases in all three sections totaling points college board officials say the data arent very reliable because students report their perceptions of what their parents make and over one third of students didnt answer the question scores slip the college board had a record number of students take the sat this year but also saw declines in average scores for all three sections critical reading average in vs in math average in vs in writing average in vs in
