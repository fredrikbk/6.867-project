countrywide continues slide leaving questions of value bank of america corp s &# billion investment in countrywide financial corp last week was supposed to put an end to fears about the financial strength of the nations largest home mortgage lender so why does countrywides stock keep falling countrywides stock price is down nearly since the purchase of convertible preferred shares was announced last wednesday thats largely because investors still dont know how badly countrywide has been wounded by the recent credit crunch at a minimum countrywide faces a hit to near term earnings some analysts expect a loss in the current quarter at worst the company could be forced to dump assets at fire sale prices or seek another emergency infusion of capital potentially slashing the value of its stock further "two billion dollars from bank of america is not a lot compared to what they may need " says stuart plesser an equity analyst at standard &amp poors in new york though countrywide bills the investment a "vote of confidence " mr plesser thinks the sale of preferred stock signaled distress the preferred stock carries a yield of and is convertible into a stake of about of countrywides common shares at &# apiece the stock had been &# only five weeks earlier and mr plesser doesnt think countrywide would have sold such a large stake at such a low price unless it needed cash immediately countrywide stock was at &# just before the investment was announced late wednesday afternoon the stock then spurted to a high of &# thursday morning but has been falling since then yesterday it fell cents or to &# in p m trading on the new york stock exchange part of the problem is that investors are in the dark countrywides latest profit guidance came on july when it forecast that earnings per share this year would be between &# and &# down from &# for since then a near panic among investors has changed almost everything for mortgage lenders they no longer can count on financing their lending through commercial paper and other short term borrowing because investors are shunning those markets investors also are reluctant to buy most loans or mortgage securities that dont come with the guarantee of government sponsored investors fannie mae and freddie mac or insurance from the federal housing administration that leaves a question mark over the value of countrywides holdings of loans and mortgage securities as of june the company had about &# billion of loans that were due to be sold to investors that includes prime quality loans subprime mortgages for people with weak credit records and alt a loans a category between prime and subprime frederick cannon an analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods says the total amount of loans waiting to be sold may now top &# billion given the current difficulty of finding buyers for many types of loans mr cannon says it isnt clear what share of the loans can be sold to fannie and freddie or how much countrywide may have to mark down the value of the others countrywide also had about &# billion of "trading securities " mostly mortgage related as of june mr cannon worries that some of these also may have lost considerable value a countrywide spokesman says the "overwhelming majority" of those securities are backed by fannie or freddie or the u s government and there is "no serious impairment" to the portfolios value in addition countrywides savings bank held about &# billion of mortgage securities excluding those guaranteed by fannie or freddie and may have to mark down some mr cannon adds the spokesman declined to comment analysts can only guess at what the value of countrywides holdings might be at the end of the third quarter but paul j miller jr of friedman billings ramsey &amp co says countrywide may need to write down &# billion to &# billion in the value of loans that dont fit the criteria for sale to fannie or freddie keefe bruyettes mr cannon roughly estimates that countrywide will have a loss of cents a share in the third quarter "what many people on wall street are trying to figure out now is what will be the future profitability of this company " says david honold a portfolio manager at turner investment partners in berwyn pa turner manages about &# billion in assets and doesnt own countrywide shares countrywide is counting on its savings bank along with fannie mae and freddie mac to fund nearly all of its future lending by drawing on deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank system countrywide officials say the banks above average interest rates on certificates of deposit and savings accounts are reversing a recent loss of deposits new deposits have exceeded outflows so far this week a countrywide spokesman says meanwhile countrywides lending is expected to drop sharply at least in the short term as it avoids making loans that cant be held as long term investments or sold to fannie and freddie the relatively conservative "conforming" loans that fannie and freddie buy tend to be much less profitable than the subprime alt a and other "exotic" loans pumped out by countrywide and other lenders until recently others worry about the &# billion of option adjustable rate mortgages held as investments by countrywides bank these loans known as option arms give borrowers the choice of making minimal monthly payments no principal and even less than the interest normally due in the early years if they make those minimal payments the loan balance grows setting the borrower up for a sharp rise in monthly costs it is unclear how well borrowers will cope once the higher payments set in these option arms many granted in and at the top of the housing boom will be "stress tested" beginning next year s&amp ps mr plesser says a "significant portion" of those option arms are covered by private mortgage insurance against losses because of defaults the countrywide spokesman says if things get too rough for countrywide mr plesser figures federal regulators might arrange a rescue or countrywide might raise cash by selling its large loan servicing business investors may have to wait at least a few weeks for countrywide to provide an update on its survival plans an annual "investor forum " due to be held sept and has been delayed until nov countrywide says its chief executive angelo mozilo is set to address another investor gathering in san francisco sept the host is his new protector apparent bank of america
