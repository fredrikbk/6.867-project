the power lunch cafeteria style company canteens host roving bands of networkers recruiting over a wii game a few months after google inc fired mark jen for blogging about work he slipped into one of the companys cafeterias to score a free lunch with friends he had no idea that he was also helping to launch a nationwide phenomenon "we thought this was a great way to check out different companies and also get a free lunch " says mr jen now a year old program manager at tagged inc a san francisco based online social network that lunch about two years ago went so well the group decided to make it a regular event they began meeting at corporate cafeterias around the bay area in an effort to rub elbows with employees at other technology companies and snare some of the free food that many tech companies provide they posted their lunch schedule on a blog and opened the meetings to anyone interested "we are in silicon valley which has a lot of tech companies " says mr jen but he says that employees "dont really branch out and meet other people from other companies " the concept dubbed lunch by its founders has grown into a social networking phenomenon that now draws hundreds of engineers venture capitalists and even summer interns to various companies for free meals and conversation it used to be that the group which initially consisted of fewer than people practically had to sneak through a companys doors some attendees would get in with friends who were employees while others sneaked by security google where it all started allows employees to bring guests to the companys cafeteria mr jen got in with a friend who worked there but now as the lunches have begun to draw larger crowds companies are inviting in the lunch goers as a way to woo potential hires and push their products to influential bloggers who attend employers ranging from social networking company facebook inc to microsoft corp have hosted lunch events and the idea is spreading similar lunch groups have already sprouted in seattle and germany while chapters in bangalore and los angeles are planning to host their first events next month the lunch founders have received inquiries from employees who want to start chapters in new york atlanta and singapore the evolution of lunch from a way to mooch free food to a company sponsored event illustrates how in a tighter labor market employers are finding more nontraditional ways to access top job candidates the lunches provide companies with a unique opportunity since the events attract people who work for their competitors employers are able to scout for potential hires who have the specific interests and credentials they are looking for and can meet them face to face on their own turf "were returning to that time in silicon valley where talent is tight and the competition for engineers is heating " says john mccrea vice president of marketing at plaxo inc an online address book company that has hosted three lunches the lunches also offer a chance for companies to market their products to early adopters many companies especially start ups set up product demos at the lunch events hoping to generate buzz in the blogosphere "lunch builds positive brand associations both for those who attend and those who hear about it later in conversation posted photos and blog entries " says paul c jeffries a consultant to start ups in silicon valley although the events are now hosted by companies they still have a "guerrilla feel like the tech community is crashing the gate and taking over the company " other than nametags the events are unstructured and hardly swanky for one thing everyone shows up in jeans typical of the bay area culture earlier this month about people showed up at a plaxo lunch in mountain view calif to eat popeyes chicken "we went for comfort food " says mr mccrea adding that a couple of employees decided to deejay the event at a recent event at professional social networking company linkedin corp s headquarters attendees played four square a childrens game where players bounce a ball to each other in a two by two grid a room was set up for those who wanted to play the nintendo wii a game machine lunch attendees arent necessarily looking for a job some show up just to talk shop others simply crave a free meal outside their own cafeterias "its a perfect applicant pool because they are gainfully employed people who are geared toward passively looking for a job " says tey scott recruiting manager at time warner inc s aol a recent lunch at aol drew about people into the companys mountain view office for pizza the company had set up a table with information for prospective hires attendees say the casual atmosphere makes it easy to interact with higher ups at a company while getting a glimpse of the working environment for instance earlier this summer mike miller a former senior staff engineer at sun microsystems inc met both a senior recruiter and linkedin chief executive dan nye at the companys lunch event "i thought it was really cool " says mr miller who says he enjoyed playing wii and took home a ball for his kids "it was a high energy atmosphere " after the lunch the recruiter contacted him for an interview mr miller was hired as a principal software engineer in july to be sure networking groups are not new to the bay area but the concept of lunch a free event that takes place inside a company and is open to virtually anyone who is interested is now taking off in other cities the nature of the events varies depending on each community says terry chay a lunch founder and software architect at tagged for instance san francisco lunches are generally smaller because of space restrictions and tend to draw a wider variety of occupations events in silicon valley can draw up to a few hundred people many of which are engineers he says but as the events expand attendees and hosts of lunch question whether the concept will retain its grassroots appeal "as these grow people might be less willing to attend them once they see the third party recruiters invading their space " says ms scott of aol a few third party recruiters and recruitment vendors attended the event at aol she says it could be a potential turn off to those who go to lunch because they find the concept different from a typical networking event for companies keeping the events laid back and unstructured can be a challenge "this is a community event unlike what corporations usually do which is set up booths and pitch " says jeremiah owyang director of corporate media strategy at podtech net a media network and a consultant to fortune companies smaller start ups are more eager to embrace the idea but larger corporations especially those that are used to controlling communications flow through a public relations team may be reluctant to open their doors to an internet savvy audience that shares its thoughts through blogs and social networks online mr owyang says "i hope they roll up their cuffs and unbutton the shirt a bit " another group called lunchgeeks has started in the bay area with the intention of keeping their events smaller and void of corporate interference they meet monthly to chat about the latest technology products usually at a restaurant since the meals arent free the lunches generally draw smaller crowds of six to people "the goal is to have everyone be there with no masks on and being open and honest rather than having to put up a front for vc or recruiters or even press " says don macaskill chief executive officer of online photo sharing site smugmug inc and founder of lunchgeeks he views the lunches as a place for entrepreneurs to talk freely about the troubles they encounter while running start up companies they would be reluctant to do so he says in front of media and venture capitalists the lunch founders define the concept as "characterized by open communication decentralization of authority freedom to share food and ideas and the lunch as a conversation " according to their site the name is a play off the term "web " which refers to a second generation of web services that aim to facilitate sharing among users the founders expect more companies to ask to host lunches in the future though mr jen isnt sure whether they will ever be invited into google "that remains to be seen " he says google declined to comment as to whether it would host a lunch
