business bookshelf bartering up to a better life one red paperclip by kyle macdonald three rivers pages &# two years ago kyle macdonald was a year old marketer of table shox a shock absorber meant to prevent restaurant tables from wobbling sensing the signs of a limited career path mr macdonald a montrealer faced an obvious choice he could get serious and send off resumes in quest of a real job or he could take one of the red paper clips binding his resumes together and trade it on the internet for something "bigger and better " with the idea of eventually "bartering up to a house " naturally he chose the second course "one red paperclip" is his story as soon as the clip was advertised on craigslist two women from vancouver rhawnie and corinna by name offered a fish shaped pen in exchange before long in return for the pen annie from seattle gave mr macdonald a ceramic doorknob sculpted to look like e t the extra terrestrial after a rough night out and on it went from a neon budweiser sign to a recording contract put up by a toronto student with access to a studio which jody gnant an aspiring recording artist snagged by offering mr macdonald a rent free year in a house in phoenix ariz but mr macdonald was looking to own not rent and so he kept going it turned out that rock star alice cooper has a restaurant in phoenix an employee at alices restaurant looking to live rent free offered an afternoon hanging out with her boss mr macdonald promptly traded quality time with mr cooper for a snow globe branded with the logo of the rock band kiss enter the actor corbin bernsen who starred in the tv show "l a law" years ago and now appears on the series "psych " mr bernsen owns more than snow globes he offered a speaking part in his new movie in return for mr macdonalds then in july of last year the town of kipling saskatchewan entered the barter sequence it gave mr macdonald a renovated s house on main street in return for the film role which it then raffled off in a local "american idol" style audition won by a town resident named nolan hubbard mr macdonald and his girlfriend dom moved to kipling having achieved their goal of turning a paper clip into a house mr macdonald by the way now has a movie deal with dreamworks mr macdonald is a likable dude always getting "pumped" or "stoked" by his adventures which he relates in an amusing and breezy way but without much analytical rigor thats a shame because he has inspired any number of imitators who barter off the detritus of their lives a young man named aaron todd did quite well recently with poker chips embossed with an image of william shatners kidney stone which mr shatner himself had auctioned off to the casino that issued them what is going on here it is a question that mr macdonald never addresses but we can try its unusual to encounter a market in which the participants have neither a strong desire for the items they bargain for nor any wish to convert them into cash yet to a large degree this is what mr macdonald has created rhawnie and corinna were not in the market for a red paper clip annie was not on the prowl for a fish pen an exception here is mr bernsen who is apparently always interested in new snow globes most of the people in the red paper clip chain could not have easily sold their items for cash in any case they didnt want to at last report annie still has her pen after all as she says its "famous" and rhawnie and corinna held onto their paper clip they returned it to mr macdonald only so that he could twist it into an engagement ring for the redoubtable dom true some of mr macdonalds trading partners did actually want the goods being offered ms gnant and mr hubbard were happy to pick up the recording contract and the movie role but in such cases its really the traders themselves who are the goods their goal was to become known mr macdonald warmed to this aspect of his endeavor too becoming ecstatic when "good morning america" gave air time to his exploits even annie was delighted when her local abc affiliate allowed her to publicize her views on "challenging the concept we have of value " so is the world of the red paper clip a kind of labor market in which the participants offer up their talents not really the people who won the recording contract and movie role merely had something wacky to trade not necessarily talent and mr macdonald and annie were offering just themselves as fodder for content hungry media so if the world of the red paper clip is neither a typical goods nor a typical labor market then what is it perhaps its the world of another alice the world through the looking glass on one side of the mirror the side where most of us live we each make our way in the marketplace based on our own unique bundles of ability and work experience the object of our quest money is just the opposite it is utterly interchangeable a dollar is a dollar and we dont know or care about where its been or what its done on the other side of the looking glass the world of one red paper clip things operate in reverse here it is individuals who become interchangeable and their past experience irrelevant content is content and anyone can fill the bill for a recording contract or film role the objects of the quest by contrast are unique or idiosyncratic fish pens and doorknobs come across in mr macdonalds book as having more personality than their owners and are valued precisely for where theyve been and what theyve "done " why else would rhawnie and corinna hang onto the paper clip its because as mr macdonald says it has "a great story " ultimately mr macdonald wants us to marvel at the fact that he exchanged a paper clip for a house and so we do still more marvelous is the exchange that made it possible between the qualities of people and of the objects they possess mr starks latest book is "the limits of medicine" cambridge
