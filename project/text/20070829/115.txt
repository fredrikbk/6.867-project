verasun takes on ethanol field verasun energy corp is on the march to conquer a sizable portion of the ethanol industry its forebearers in conventional oil refining have blazed the trail cutting a wide swath through the sector with well timed and well executed acquisitions "were very focused on a single plan that is to ramp up production " verasun chief executive don endres said in an interview verasun the largest pure play ethanol producer plans to acquire big plants that can efficiently be networked together giving it economies of scale using a similar plan to acquire large refineries valero energy corp the largest u s independent crude oil refiner landed its spot with an acquisition in and sealed the deal when it bought rival refiner premcor in verasuns acquisitive nature may enable the company to weather industrial consolidation and lean periods during low margins as valero has the companies similarities allow verasun to be seen in the context of conventional energy companies while verasun follows in valeros footsteps the nascent ethanol industry presents the company with some challenges that the more established refining sector lacked primarily verasun will need to overcome the sectors relatively high asset prices vulnerability to regulatory changes and small scale that makes it more difficult to establish a global presence verasuns share price indicates some of these challenges the stock recently traded around &# and has fallen this year like other companies in the sector fears of a coming ethanol glut have prevented growth of verasuns perceived value south dakota based verasun announced its first major acquisition in late july buying closely held asalliances biofuels llc the &# million deal put the company on track to operate billion gallons of annual ethanol production capacity by the end of the move puts verasun ahead of its competitors in the independent ethanol sector and second only to archer daniels midland co an agricultural giant that also operates about a billion gallons of ethanol production capacity while other independent producers have about market share verasun is poised to have nearly by but whether verasun can hold this top spot remains to be seen biofuels energy corp has been outspoken about its plans to grow through acquisitions and aventine renewable energy holdings inc may acquire other ethanol facilities to compensate for its relatively slim growth profile a g edwards analyst ron oster said verasuns mr endres said the company is steering toward large modern plants with about million gallons of annual capacity positioned near relatively inexpensive corn and easy rail access for transporting the fuel "our focus is not size alone its scale with low cost " said mr endres the reduced costs come in part from having easy access to both corn which the plants require and rail lines which are used to distribute the fuel the quest for such large scale facilities is a challenge only about a dozen plants that meet mr endress criteria exist and competition for these few assets may be fierce said robert lane a houston based analyst with sanders morris harris when valero was buying up refineries it sought plants with similar attributes big capacity prime locations and the ability to process cheap crude oil however valero was able to get these plants at prices that were lower than what it would have to pay if it were to build plants from scratch as the industry consolidated and oil majors were forced to sell off their refineries the renewable fuels market now bears little resemblance to the refining industry at its nadir plants are selling at prices in excess of their replacement cost "everyone is scrambling over each other to build capacity even as margins are shrinking " said mr lane "no one believes or appears to believe that their ethanol plant is going to be unsuccessful " but valero showed the same optimism even when the refining market was weak a view that ultimately landed the company in a position to benefit from refining margins when they strengthened "its the same in that theyre still being aggressive about buying and growing their asset base despite the downturn in the market " a g edwardss mr oster said "but i dont think verasun is adding quite the value that you saw valero add when they were making their acquisitions " another similarity lies in their exposure to volatile commodities prices valero took advantage of periods with low margins to acquire refineries cheaply it also weathered leaner times by asking staff throughout the corporation for suggestions on how to cut back without adversely impacting the business "the biggest challenge to an ethanol producer is that their profitability is driven by two separate commodity markets agricultural for corn and energy for gasoline and therefore ethanol " said pavel molchanov a houston based analyst with raymond james the two markets have the ability to squeeze ethanol margins if corn goes up while ethanol prices fall "in the near term youre still dealing with a company trying to grow on an unstable commodity margin " said mr lane of sanders morris in the long run technology may deliver verasun from this squeeze recently mr endres announced plans for verasun to invest in a company that is developing new technologies that may eventually produce ethanol from sources other than corn additionally the companys purview may extend into diesel type products as well mr endress optimism extends to all of the companys endeavors in part it is derived from the access to capital that ethanol companies have in addition the industrys rapid growth may allow verasun to compete on a global scale with producers of other fuels together all of verasuns plants soon will have the capacity of a small crude oil refinery ultimately verasun seeks the ability to compete on this larger stage mr endres said as verasun strives to gain market share it may also emerge as a company that can hold weight in the energy industry by the company will have roughly barrels a day of capacity the same as a small oil refinery
