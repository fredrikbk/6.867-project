safety rules not at fault in fire near ground zero daniel henningers wonder land column regarding the recent tragedy at the deutsche bank building is in a word outrageous "we have met the enemy again " aug he lays the blame for the fire on the entirely appropriate and legally mandated environmental safety guidelines that governed the buildings demolition saying that "procedural perfectionism has been raised to religious status " it was plainly seen in reports i released publicly some years ago that there were extraordinary levels of contamination present in the deutsche bank building due to the collapse of the world trade center federal laws strictly direct the manner in which such buildings can be taken down to prevent an unnecessary release of toxins into the air we did not need to compound the threat to public safety with a haphazard demolition the local residents and i did not demand "procedural perfectionism " but simple adherence to the law such adherence would prevent a reoccurrence of the environmental catastrophe that followed the collapse of the world trade center if mr henninger is looking to place blame he should focus his attention on those agencies and companies that did not act properly the fire department did not have a prepared fire plan for the building and the contractors john galt and safeway failed to maintain standpipes in gross violation of the law blame cannot be placed on the residents who demanded that both public health and worker safety be protected during the demolition process rep jerrold nadler d n y washington
