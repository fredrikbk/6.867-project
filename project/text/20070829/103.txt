the economy business kansans vie over whos best for business johnson county kan in this land of leafy corporate estates and mansion lined cul de sacs registered republicans outnumber democrats to yet since they have elected a democrat to represent them in congress that incongruity is making johnson county a nationally watched battleground ahead of the elections at stake is a district of extraordinary value to leaders of both parties in washington and at issue is whether a democratic incumbent can retain the support of one of americas most prosperous and conservative centers of business the district gained importance for democrats following their many congressional victories last november in right leaning suburbs faced with skepticism about whether they can retain those seats in they can point with confidence to democratic rep dennis moore who has won re election four times here on the outskirts of kansas city mo for republicans rep moore represents a pesky contradiction to their argument that conservative americans vote a straight ticket during presidential elections in and voters here supported george w bush then switched columns and chose rep moore a self described conservative democrat who has voted with republicans on issues such as trade tax cuts and tort and bankruptcy reform an economic powerhouse johnson county ranks in the th percentile of american counties in personal income according to the county economic research institute an independent nonprofit agency devoted to studying the county indeed it says something about the priorities of

them white until rep moores victory in democrats hadnt held a congressional seat in the district that johnson county dominates since that victory came as johnson county was developing into an epicenter of conflict between fiscal and social conservatives in the republican party in a state where some republican leaders have made high priorities out of combatting abortion the teaching of evolution in public schools and other nonfiscal issues prompting some moderate republican leaders to switch parties rep moore has benefited from a perception that his opponents cared less about business than about abortion but last week any chance of him enjoying that advantage in vanished when a republican state senator named nick jordan announced his candidacy for rep moores seat an entrepreneur a former president of this countys largest tourism and convention body and a legislator renowned for measures aimed at stimulating economic growth mr jordan says his efforts have helped attract dozens of companies and thousands of jobs to kansas having recently completed so called candidate school in washington at the invitation of national party leaders mr jordan is already taking aim at his opponent "democrat dennis moore has been elected from this district by consistently portraying himself as something he is not a republican " according to one of mr jordans campaign messages one republican who voted for rep moore in the past but doesnt intend to in is thomas holden executive director of the hotel &amp lodging association of kansas city "nick jordan represents the will of the johnson county people he understands business " says mr holden in particular he is critical of rep moores recent vote for the employee free choice act a measure endorsed by organized labor that would make it easier for workers to unionize a spokeswoman for rep moore declined to comment on that vote but she argued that the congressman a former johnson county district attorney has been a consistent supporter of businesses large and small and she noted that he holds a leadership position in a conservative group of house democrats called the blue dog democrats in washington meanwhile democratic leaders are including rep moore in a program called frontline designed to shore up support for party members facing tough campaigns it isnt the first time rep moore has been included in the frontline program and his campaign manager julie murz predicts it wont be the last "were in an overwhelmingly republican district " she says "so were always going to be part of it im afraid "
