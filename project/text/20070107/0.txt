soft landing may cut returns on cash stay short be happy thats recently been the mantra for many savers whove been able to collect higher yields on cash like money market mutual funds than on longer term bonds that carry added risk but is likely to be the year that the cash party comes to an end most economists expect the federal reserve to start trimming its target for short term interest rates after a series of increases since mid as part of its effort to engineer an economic "soft landing " money fund yields which move in tandem would thus fall and the unusual current situation of yields on money funds and other short term instruments topping those of bonds "wont last forever " says mary miller director of the fixed income division at investment manager t rowe price group in baltimore indeed by the end of this year the yield on the benchmark year treasury note will once again top that of three month treasury bills according to the consensus of economists recently surveyed by the wall street journal on dec they expect the treasury yields to be for three months and for years a flipflop from current yields of about for three months and for years what should income investors do most should probably follow the longstanding advice to keep money in intermediate term bond funds rather than either very short or very long instruments in a soft landing a previously red hot economy slows to a comfortable pace without raging price increases and also without tumbling into recession the feds primary tool to accomplish that is its target short term interest rate currently the fed slows the inflation or rising prices that often comes with rapid growth by raising rates it nurtures growth by lowering rates which makes it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend inflation has lately been higher than the fed prefers but it could seem "a lot less threatening by this summer " says a g edwards economist gary thayer that could clear the way for rate cuts the journal panel believes the fed will cut its target a half point to by year end which means yields on money funds would generally fall by the same magnitude for more on the journals semiannual survey of economists go online to wsj com economists the average money fund is now yielding with the most competitive lowest expense funds above according to imoneynet in westborough mass the recent unusual situation of short term interest rates exceeding long rates is known as an "inverted yield curve " it usually signals an economic slowdown which is expected this year it also means that investors have had little incentive to go from cash like holdings to longer term instruments which fluctuate more widely in price bond yields and prices move in opposite directions when interest rates in the marketplace drop investors bid up the prices of existing bonds with attractive fixed rates but when interest rates climb holders of older lower rate bonds are hit by tumbling prices the economists surveyed by the journal arent expecting dramatic changes in yields but with a drop in short rates and a slight climb in long rates they believe will see a return to a "normal" yield curve in which investors are paid more to take the greater price risk associated with longer term bonds of course the consensus economic prediction could be wrong if the economy falls into a recession or inflation surges the rate outlook changes dramatically one of the most pessimistic forecasters in the survey james smith of western carolina university and parsec financial management in asheville n c is expecting two quarters of negative economic growth the textbook definition of a recession dr smith predicts the fed will lower its rate sharply to by dec he sees both short and long term yields falling with month treasurys at on dec and year treasurys at while few other economists expect a recession investors who are of that view might want to shift dollars from money funds to longer term bonds which would go up in price as rates fall conversely gail fosler chief economist at the conference board known for its consumer confidence index is predicting an uptick in inflation ms fosler is looking for the fed to raise its rate to by dec and sees year treasurys ending at in that case investors would do better in money funds than in bonds which would fall in price the advice from most fixed income strategists is to play it safe in with intermediate term bond funds those with an average maturity of say four to years ms miller of t rowe price notes that if inflation picks up and yields climb on long bonds then the prices of intermediate bonds will suffer less severely if the economy slows intermediates will still deliver some price gains she says intermediate funds such as her firms t rowe price new income fund prcix make "offensive and defensive" sense within the intermediate term category look at "total market" bond funds which hold a mix of government corporate and mortgage bonds suggests fran kinniry a principal in the investment counseling and research division at vanguard group one example vanguard total bond market index fund vbmfx to be sure the recent returns on intermediate term bond funds arent particularly impressive the average one year total return from interest and price change is according to chicago researcher morningstar that looks paltry compared to one of the star categories of "high yield" or below investment grade bond funds up just over but experts warn investors not to make the mistake of diving into high yield bond funds with a "me too" mentality when the economy slows high yield bonds tend to suffer because some companies default on their debt and investors start demanding higher yields "the market simply is not pricing in the risk of defaults " says mark kiesel a portfolio manager and executive vice president at pacific investment management co email forum sunday wsj com
