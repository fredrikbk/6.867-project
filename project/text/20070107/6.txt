love &amp money a tale of love lost and found when will amy and i divorce its an odd question i know but it is nevertheless a question i often hear from readers im even told that the reporters and editors at one of the newspapers where my column runs have a pool going on when well finally split to that newsroom can i put &# on never with this concern out there i want to take this opportunity as a new year begins to fill you in on a missing piece to the puzzle that is our public life in the late winter of amy and i filed for divorce as is obvious we never followed through on the paperwork this weekend in fact we are celebrating our th wedding anniversary and based on how close weve grown in the past seven years i have no doubt well be together for the duration a near divorce will do that to you make you recalibrate your life and work in a way that allows you to see what really matters with a renewed passion but we did separate for a while and its in that separation that near divorce that the moral of todays story rests and heres the punch line love never dies it just gets lost behind lifes debris including the money and the career that we pack in front of it when talk of divorce invaded our life amy and i had been married seven years and we were pulling in opposing directions i was trying to pursue the kind of life i was drawn to moving to new york city or a foreign capital traveling widely for my job building my version of a glamorous career amy was moving along another plane with the arrival of our son she began focusing on family no longer curious about the world or living anywhere that took her farther away from her family back in our hometown of baton rouge la the cogs in our wheels werent meshing they were grinding i threw myself deeper into my job spending longer hours at work just to avoid a family dynamic i was no longer comfortable with traveling as much as possible to create distance amy felt increasingly alone and angry with me the tensions mounted and we both began to shut down frustrations burying the affection that had bound us together once we could no longer see that affection we filed for divorce and separated i stayed in seattle while amy and our year old son moved to louisiana i can still hear my sons words as i walked away "mommy daddy go bye bye " and thats when things began to change when i was finally alone and could see more clearly one thing stood out my affection for amy had never died it had just been obscured by the anger and frustration that were poisoning my thoughts i was blinded by the anger so i set a change of course im not naive enough to think divorce is never the answer but as a culture we too often treat divorce like another fast food menu choice a quick fix when the pangs strike oblivious to long term effects particularly when kids are involved and i was nearly as guilty of it as anyone but i have a certain perspective that tempered my rush to divorce i come from a broken family my parents divorced when i was two years old i grew up without my dad around and i never wanted to inflict that special kind of torture on my own son i spent my disposable income flying from seattle to louisiana every few weeks to spend time with my son during those trips three truths struck me first a perfect life had been staring at me all along second even the happiest couples struggle with balancing relationships and careers and third my wife was not the person i assumed her to be i came to see amy not as the teenager she was when we began dating but the woman she had grown into and that was a pretty amazing woman we worked on righting the wrongs and i found myself happier in the process i began to de emphasize career attending all my sons school functions with amy and being more attentive to our relationship i traveled less when i had to i cut trips shorter than usual in reality that often meant traveling the right amount of time rather than trying to stretch out each trip we spent more time playing together as a family as a result amy and i grew closer than wed ever been and weve never doubted our commitment since so why am i announcing all of this on the first sunday of divorce filings often peak just after the holidays that means theres someone many someones out there right now living something similar to what i experienced theyre struggling with a relationship or what promotions to pursue theyre yearning for a different lifestyle angry looking to escape the mind numbing rut they are in and they cant see what they really have divorce is the quick fix and it may indeed be the right fix as well but based on my own experience it also may not be it may be that the affection is there just waiting to be rediscovered it certainly was for me in the intervening years amy and i have accomplished together more than either of us would have accomplished alone to figure that out took my nearly throwing it all away and thats why im telling you this i stared into an abyss in the winter of and i stepped away and evaluated the impact my actions would have not just on my world but on the world of other people namely my wife and son in doing so i turned potentially the biggest mistake of my life into the smartest move ive ever made so when will amy and i get divorced i hope you now know the answer jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the
