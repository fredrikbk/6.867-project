marketwatch keeping your credit rating healthy some u s consumers are more confident about their ability to manage credit than they should be while of consumers say they use credit responsibly more than of fico scores one of the most common credit scores are below generally considered the usual cutoff for good loan terms according to a survey released in october by fair isaac the minneapolis developer of the fico score "its interesting that consumers when asked feel confident about it but thats not really backed up by their actual scores " says andy jolls vice president for myfico com a division of fair isaac and while of consumers strongly agree that they use credit responsibly only strongly agree they understand what goes into a credit score meanwhile say theyre only concerned about their creditworthiness when they have a problem "the time to manage your credit is not when youre trying to put it to use " mr jolls says "when youre trying to actually buy a house and close in lets say three weeks theres not a lot you can do about your credit score in that time but if you were to look at it several months out there are things you can do " what can you do to improve your score given that of the fico score is based on your payment history paying your bills on time will over time improve your score another of the fico is based on how much you owe so keeping your balances low is crucial the fico typically measures your credit utilization rate the total dollars youve charged as a percentage of the total of all your credit limits so you want to make sure youre not nearing those limits "typically you want to pay down the debts on each card to below of the limit " says lucy duni director of consumer education at transunions truecredit com which offers consumers its own version of a credit score your score will vary depending on the statistical model but the fico is commonly used less important but still accounting for about to each of your fico are how long youve had credit and the number of inquiries which occur when you apply for credit hard inquiries as opposed to soft inquiries which dont affect your score such as when creditors check your credit for marketing purposes or when you pull your own credit report can decrease your score but many consumers wont notice a steep drop "for many people one new hard inquiry wont affect their fico score at all for others a hard inquiry will lower their scores by less than five points " says craig watts a spokesman for fair isaac "inquiries can have a more dramatic effect when the person has a very short credit history has very few accounts or triggers a lot of hard inquiries in a short time " he says the mix of credit you hold such as student loans credit card debt and mortgage loans can also affect your score "fair isaacs studies show that people who can successfully manage multiple kinds of credit accounts are lower risks everything else being equal than people whose credit reports show less diverse experience " mr watts says still your account mix affects less than about of the total score also dont forget the score models look at many moving parts an action that raises one persons score could lower yours for example applying for a new line of credit will temporarily reduce many peoples credit scores "statistically you are a riskier borrower when you open new accounts " mr watts says your score will rise again in a few months as you pay that new account on time he notes but a new credit card could improve the score of a borrower with just one type of credit such as a student loan "when someone with a very limited credit profile opens a different type of credit because theyve expanded the type of credit that change can in fact improve their fico score " mr watts says "we dont recommend people open new accounts in hopes that this will raise their score because its relatively rare " what about the smart financial move of opening up a low interest rate card to move a balance there from a higher rate card almost always "thats going to lower your score because youre opening new accounts more often than the average consumer is " mr watts says "the fico score cant see the interest rates youre paying it has no idea why youre opening new accounts it can only see what the report shows and that is a more frequent pursuit of new credit than is typical " still consumers with high credit scores can afford to pursue lower interest rate cards "because you know you can afford these small hits to your score " mr watts says with "good credit habits your score will recover " and given that the new account increases your overall credit limit as long as you dont close the old one you could get a positive nudge to your credit utilization rate "in some cases the person could be improving their score slightly by adding more available credit " he says still "they could be hurting their score by opening new accounts in order to get at that available credit "
