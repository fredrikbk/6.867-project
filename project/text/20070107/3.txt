eyes on the road remakes and sequels in detroit auto makers repeat the past with their future vehicles on display at auto show the auto industry is trotting out its hollywood side at the big north american international auto show in detroit this week the motor city and hollywood have a deeper connection than the gaggle of movie and television celebrities who appeared at a big event sponsored saturday by general motors corp like hollywood big auto makers recognize that the public loves a good story even if that story is partly wishful fantasy and like hollywood detroit cant resist sequels and remakes especially when theres a shortage of killer new ideas consider gms fanfare for a car called the chevrolet volt gm rolled out the volt at a big press event sunday in detroits cavernous cobo hall having previously released information in advance about the car for publication sunday morning the volt gm executives say represents gms determination to forge a path away from dependence on petroleum motor fuels using what gm calls "e flex" technology the volt could drive miles on electric only power before a small gasoline motor kicks in to recharge the batteries the volt could get as much as miles per gallon under certain conditions the volt "could nearly eliminate trips to the gas station " gm says maybe it could if it was a real car but the volt is for now no more real than the hovering landspeeder luke skywalker used to zip around tatooine gm executives acknowledge that lithium ion batteries capable of safely and reliably handling the charge and discharge cycles of a plug in hybrid vehicle such as the volt dont exist gm is betting they will exist within several years and says it will work in the meantime on the engineering for a car that could use them if the cars can be made cost effectively the volt is in many ways a sequel to a movie that didnt end well for gm the attempt in the late s to market an all electric vehicle the ev the ev was much admired by a small group of electric car enthusiasts and environmental activists who have blasted gm in a recent movie for deciding to kill the ev and repossess and crush the ones leased to individual consumers gm executives as has been noted before have since realized that behaving as if they had no interest in green vehicle technology was a bad marketing posture but whether gm will market a cost competitive plug in hybrid car like the volt any time soon remains unclear to be continued as theyd say in hollywood then theres the ballyhoo over the announcement sunday that ford motor co and microsoft have struck a deal under which ford will use a new microsoft technology called "sync" to allow drivers of the forthcoming ford focus to link their cellphones and digital music players to the car in a hands free wireless way sync will allow motorists to control their devices with voice commands microsoft and ford executives say late night comedians your ship has come in who will be the first to make fun of the car that requires you to hit control alt delete to start the air conditioning place your bets here my moneys on letterman the idea of using microsoft technology in a car is a remake from the late s when microsoft in the heat of internet boom e hype pushed hard to get car makers to warm up to its concept of the autopc the autopc among other things was supposed to perform such functions as reading your email to you while you drove to work that idea never flew but if sylvester stallone can bring back rocky balboa nothings impossible of course there will be plenty of real or soon to be real cars and trucks to catch the eye and lighten the purse at the detroit show but much of whats new in many ways plays to familiar themes for fans of "lifestyles of the rich and famous" theres the &# plus rolls royce convertible with reverse opening doors common on cars built before and for folks who couldnt get enough of the brady bunch chrysler took the wraps off the design of its new minivans which will offer optional swiveling seats and a pop up card table that allow second and third row passengers to face each other and play euchre on those long road trips with each successive generation chryslers minivans get closer to replicating the features and functions of s conversion vans those rolling party wagons with the shag carpeting and the "if this vans rockin dont come knocking" signs maybe the s werent so bad perhaps shapes similar to the boxy chrysler k cars and wheezy econoboxes of the s will be on the show platforms next year send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
