book excerpt post bubble property still pays adapted from the wall street journal complete real estate investing guidebook by david crook copyright by dow jones &amp co inc published by three rivers press an imprint of the crown publishing group a division of random house inc so you think theres still a buck to be made in real estate youre right theres plenty of money to be made because everyone still has to live somewhere and everyone has to work somewhere and everyone has to shop somewhere and someone has to provide the space thats where the real estate investor comes in making money by providing one of lifes necessities and just about anyone can be a real estate investor the capital requirements are quite minimal and there are comparatively few legal restrictions on how you operate keep that in mind as we look at how to raise money and learn the real estate business so lets start at the beginning with the first thing any investor ever asks where will i get the money you can get good quality loans on buildings with up to four apartments under the same easy lending terms that you can use to buy any residential property a lender will allow you to include the rental income along with your salary when you compute whether you can afford the loan try to keep the basic payment called "piti" for principal interest taxes insurance to or less of your before tax income including the rental income you want to limit your risk and you want to buy as much property as you can comfortably afford you do that by using "leverage" paying a fraction of the purchase price yourself and borrowing the rest its called using other peoples money its a good kind of debt to take on if you have an investment that uses even more of other peoples money renters to make the monthly payments and produce a profit the properties may not always be in the neighborhoods you most prefer and they may need more work than you might like but as long as a building is livable or can be made so quickly and a neighborhood is passable then you can get started building your real estate empire getting focused and the beginning actually starts well before youre ready to buy a property you will need to decide early on what kind of properties you want to specialize in what kind of real estate empire do you see for yourself in years once you determine your focus you will need to learn as much as you can about that business as it functions in your area dont be discouraged but do give yourself plenty of time plan on at least one full year from the time you decide to get into real estate investing and when you close on your first property build a network you need to develop a network of real estate professionals people who can help you acquire properties because you are unlikely to find the best places just scanning newspaper or web listings all alone marc asselin and his partners his brother in law and his father in law trade in properties in the boynton beach fla area they concentrate on buying vacant lots that they can get for a fraction of their developed value and hold on to them until a buyer comes along mr asselin has even developed his own "investor network" that puts potential land buyers in touch with other landowners "youd be surprised how many of the people you know are involved in real estate if you ask them " says mr asselin a software engineer who built his network starting with just the real estate agent who sold him his home then the network expanded to include an attorney and an accountant one place you might look for contacts is in real estate class while certainly not required of real estate investors a real estate license doesnt hurt it helps to establish you as a professional which has distinct tax advantages and it lets you negotiate as a professional which can result in sales commission savings for you real estate class is also a place where you can find a mentor someone like hal wilson a real estate agent and entrepreneur who has helped to educate two generations of nashville area real estate professionals and investors he calls his own investing philosophy "driving for dollars" searching for derelict abandoned or otherwise below average diamonds in the rough houses and buildings in neighborhoods that are showing improvement its a way of doing business that he has taught to hundreds of local landlords and investors through his classes his personal appearances his radio show and through the member real estate investors of nashville network reintn net the group which meets once a month or so gives local landlords a place to get to know each other and to swap stories while making contacts with lenders contractors and other real estate professionals most cities have similar organizations ask around the internet is also a good source yahoo lists more than local national and international real estate investing groups dont fall for schemers lines be skeptical listen to your inner bull detector avoid schemers avoid real estate investing gurus and other blowhards who make money selling investment seminars or "get rich quick and easy" real estate books these guys make their money feeding fantasies as the nations real estate frenzy reached a full boil in the real estate schemers went into hyperdrive at a series of "real estate wealth expos" in los angeles new york and other big cities thousands of would be donald trumps paid up to &# to hear well donald trump and other marquee princes of the rich and fabulous lifestyles extol the virtues of real estate investing to huge pep rally type assemblies dont waste your money you can learn a lot more driving around with someone like jack friedman a philosopher musician landlord in nashville hell take you around to his properties in his ford escort with all his tools wrenches pliers hammers whatever it takes in the back seat and he will tell you what years of investing has taught him all for the price of the barbeque platter at corkys "i am in most ways an anomaly " he avers "i borrowed relatively little i was lucky enough to find a few below market buys and i do of my own work in short ive never done one of the sexy ways people envision doing real estate " like most serious real estate investors mr friedman is the classic millionaire next door that famously frugal unassuming invisible yet quite well to do american who bears none of the vulgar cliched trappings of wealth displayed in tv infomercials you could do worse than learning from someone like that as you try to step into the real estate business places to look for financing here are a few money sources you can explore for your real estate buys banks and mortgage companies usually you can borrow for smaller properties buildings under five units through the residential lending departments if you also plan to live in the property you will likely qualify for loans of or even more of the purchase price and interest rates will be lower larger buildings and other commercial properties are handled through "commercial lending" departments partners fifty percent of something is better than of nothing consider enlisting a partner to raise the capital you need to get an attractive property if both of you put up equal amounts of money and equally participate in managing the property you will both be entitled to of the income and the appreciation more likely however is a partnership in which you do most of the work and your partner puts up most of the money friends and family just some cautionary comments here you cant choose your family but fortunately you can choose whom you do your business with an "uncle al" interest rate inevitably comes with uncle als interest in your business private or "hard money" lenders at best private lenders can make deals happen when no one else can at worst they are tony sopranos these loans are usually approved within days and are often funded in two weeks or less but the costs will be quite high interest rates in the teens are not uncommon and the lender may require to in upfront "discount" points sellers its quite common to have a seller "take back" or of the purchase price and carry it as a second mortgage for a few years you can expect fairly low borrowing costs and few hassles but the seller likely will insist on a higher price if he agrees to lend you money investing truism "his price your terms your price his terms "
