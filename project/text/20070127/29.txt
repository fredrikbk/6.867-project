computer and sorted through electronic photographs of men who had checked out her profile on the online dating site match com an year old practicing lawyer a retired professor and a floridian who resembled rocker eric clapton "the sheer numbers mean that i might meet someone im not afraid to bring home " says the year old widow after years of losing subscribers to racier rivals and new social networking sites geared to young singles match has become the largest online dating site in the u s by subscriptions with million members one big reason older daters like mrs williams match has been reaching out to singles over and divorcees pitching itself as a destination for mainstream daters who want serious relationships it made its site easier to navigate for people who are not internet savvy helping people find daters who meet their tastes the site owned by barry dillers iac interactive corp features a free magazine with articles on single parenthood and the love life of baby boomers its tv ads feature a year old woman with the user name danishbeauty the success is a bright spot for mr diller who is trying to wring profits from iacs stable of web businesses his better known brands include the search engine ask the loan exchange lending tree the invitation service evite and the local search site citysearch although match made up less than of iacs &# billion in sales over the past months it contributed more than of the companys &# million in operating profit in the past two years match has boosted the number of paying customers by a third matchs success in targeting older daters as well as other overlooked markets such as divorcees and suburbanites also reflects a maturing web industry that is expanding beyond its fixation on the very young and tapping other demographics including the wealthy market of boomers thats an especially promising strategy for a web site that depends on fees not the youth obsessed ad industry aol co founder steve case this month launched revolutionhealth com a web site that aims to combine health information and social networking particularly appealing to older americans mr diller says he is looking at investing in other sites that cater to the over s segment online "there is no question that they are in size and spending a very rich vein of opportunity " he said older daters "spend more money per month and are more likely to subscribe for a longer period " says nate elliott analyst with jupiterresearch at match of subscribers are over more than double the number two years ago yahoo personals has seen double digit growth in the number of users over in the past two years thanks in part to a new service that provides extra control privacy and security eharmonys fastest growing age group last year was the over segment the growing attractiveness of the boomer market means match may face growing competition as other sites vie for boomer daters eharmony for example advertises heavily and touts the way it guides communication between potential mates a lure for boomers who may be out of practice in the dating market match which powers the personals of the portals msn and aol also runs the risk of spreading itself too thin as it expands overseas while yahoo focuses on the u s market looking for love online is well on its way to becoming mainstream a survey by the pew internet &amp american life project showed that of american adults or million people know someone who had a long term relationship with or married someone they met online and or million know someone who has used an online dating service at match visitors to the site create a free online "portrait" of themselves by posting their photographs basic information build religion interests smoking habits profession and a statement about who they are and what they seek they can also read the "profiles" of matchs million registered users but they must subscribe if they want to communicate with any of them since the profiles are stripped of contact information new users pay &# to subscribe to match for one month which drops to &# per month if they sign up for six months or more match was launched in and was acquired by mr diller in as growth declined and competition increased match began to mimic rivals offerings of live mixers video introductions and searches for jogging partners in mid mr diller appointed jim safka who ran online marketing for at&amp t wireless to head the unit the year old mr safka who is married and a father of two set a simple goal increase the number of active online daters in each of matchs markets these daters act as a magnet for other daters making it easier for match to attract even more subscribers in those areas for three months mr safka studied subscriber data combed through financials and interviewed staffers matchs data showed him that older daters were more likely to pay to subscribe than the younger daters fascinated by that realization mr safka asked his staff to check the behavior of older daters on the site and to pinpoint their difficulties in using it for example many were stopped cold while filling out their online profile by the fourth question which asked their views on body art and piercings the company tested ideas to make the site easier to use especially for older and less technologically nimble visitors they developed a variety of one click buttons "how it works" to help new users navigate the site "see more like him her" to help users find other candidates that might catch their eye and most important a "no thanks" button to ease the awkwardness of turning down electronic suitors mrs williams likes matchs "connections" button which takes her to a set of pictures of the men with whom she corresponds before moving onto another button that lets her see whos viewed her profile "this is where i start" when logging in she says match hired "dr phil" mcgraw the tv psychologist who had won the respect of oprah winfreys largely female audience to develop mindfindbind an online guide with tips and advice on setting realistic expectations and finding a good partner available for an additional &# per month mr safka believes that dr phil extends the loyalty of his female largely older tv audience to the products he endorses and that creates buzz about match com "the married viewers refer their single friends and guys go wherever the women are clustered " mr safka says this year mr safka hired a style maven from the tv show "americas next top model" to launch a free "portrait toolkit" to help people upload photos and essays to represent themselves well on the site mr safka obsessively checks the numbers of subscriptions by the hour compared with the same hour in previous weeks to find any problems with the web site he spends an hour a day listening to customer complaints and has all staff trained to do so the site is policed by a staff of who review each profile before it is posted removing explicit photos and working to keep out prostitutes financial schemers agencies offering foreign brides and liars just four months after mr safka took over match saw a increase in paid subscriptions and by early the number of subscribers topped million today quarterly sales have risen to &# million from &# million when he took over and operating margins are approaching traffic to the match site has increased over the past year to million unique visitors per month just short of the million monthly visitors to yahoo personals which has seen its traffic drop over the past year according to the market research firm comscore it has produced some happy customers like noreen wald a year old mystery writer who uses the pen name nora charles she got engaged this christmas to a year old retired u s navy captain she met after a few years of subscribing on and off to match com "its like window shopping you get to see the pictures and read the profiles before you decide if its a good fit " but matchs efforts to boost revenue by selling more products on its site doesnt sit well with some users who resent being solicited on a site to which they have paid to subscribe beth kwon a year old editor in new york city who subscribed for several months last year was turned off by the repeated attempts to get her to sign up for dr phils when she tried to take down her profile she was asked to fill out a questionnaire "it was like when youre trying to log out of something and it doesnt let you " she said pat marsh has had men examine her electronic profile and been on half a dozen dates in the five months she has subscribed but ms marsh says she is ready to quit match at least for now she believes potential suitors regularly use outdated photos drop years from their age and add &# to their reported incomes mr safka is also trying to repeat his stateside success internationally challenging matchs chief international rival meetic which has of the french market and attracts young daters with sexy fast paced ads based on its experience in the u s match is aiming at over s seeking someone to "share lifes journey " not younger ones looking for hookups the site is also branching out to daters desiring privacy like executives or teachers reluctant to post their pictures online where subordinates or students may find them it has introduced chemistry com a premium service that shows a subscribers profile only to those candidates deemed suitable by a personality test developed by an anthropologist meanwhile mrs williams a retired editor of childrens publications continues her hunt for love online she turned to match last summer a year after she became widowed since then she has dated five men from match going out six times with one of them she is currently corresponding with several more but says shes taking things slowly while getting to know her first grandchild who was born just before christmas dating makes her feel her age men "all say they like natural looks but they want no saggy arms no crepe y necks no signs of age or use or experience " she says she says she has learned to spot men with big egos they post lots of pictures of themselves and the ones who might be married they dont post any pictures
