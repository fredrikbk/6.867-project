politics &amp economics lebanon stands at shiite sunni brink the violence that lebanon has witnessed in recent days culminating in clashes between shiite opposition activists and sunni pro government supporters has again raised the specter of a civil war with a sectarian slant that echoes the growing regional sunni shiite tensions it also has underscored how combustible the stalemate has become between the lebanese government and the opposition lebanon once viewed as a success story for democracy in the region has previously witnessed mass protests that were largely disciplined and peaceful but it has more recently seen a frightening escalation of unrest that troubles many lebanese still recovering from the year old civil war that ended in then the fighting was largely between christians and muslims now the political differences on the rise since the end of the summer war with israel have sectarian undertones among other things lebanese sunnis largely back the government while the shiite hezbollah and other shiite groups stand in the opposition christians are divided between the two camps increasing polarization in the middle east further aggravates this issue the rising clout of shiite iran and its influence in iraq and beyond has alarmed sunni regimes in the region hezbollah is backed by iran and syria while the lebanese government has the support of washington and some key european and sunni arab governments and many lebanese feel their country which boasts a delicate religious and sectarian mix has become a proxy battlefield for regional and international power struggles "lebanons political terrain is rapidly shifting away from a phase marked by mild tremors and toward another era of civil war style earthquakes in which no government will be able to find firm footing " read an editorial on the web site of the lebanese daily star newspaper "anyone who has studied the history of this fractious country knows how easily and quickly minor skirmishes can spiral out of anyones control " the editorial lamented thursdays incidents involving a scuffle in a beirut university between sunni muslim backers of the government and shiite supporters of hezbollah that disintegrated into clashes with cars set afire and fighting with stones and homemade clubs television footage showed gunmen taking aim from rooftops and windows at least three people were killed according to wire reports and each camp blamed the other for the violence "what really scares the lebanese people is that now lebanon is once again teetering on the verge of a civil war and that it may be starting to resemble the frightening iraqi scenario where sectarian sedition between the sunnis and the shiites flares " said sateh noureddine managing editor of as safir newspaper in an interview thursdays violence came the same day that international donors pledged some &# billion in aid loans and other help for lebanon and its governments economic overhaul plans the donors conference in paris was seen as a success but the violence showed it will take more than just money for war scarred and fractured lebanon to heal its wounds "any reform programs cannot take place without a political consensus " said farid el khazen a professor of politics at the american university of beirut and a member of the christian opposition allied with hezbollah "not much can be done unless you have political consensus and support " demanding greater power hezbollah led opposition supporters have staged sit in protests for nearly two months in downtown beirut demanding the government step down or a new one be formed the situation started to unravel on tuesday when the opposition stepped up its campaign burning tires in the streets in a strike that paralyzed beirut and other areas across lebanon clashes between supporters of the two camps ensued while many lebanese agree tuesday was a watershed they are divided over whom to blame "tuesdays strike has crossed the red line the opposition controlled the country in a way that is not peaceful and that did not respect the freedom of opinion " mr noureddine said amal saad ghorayeb an expert on hezbollah said that feeling threatened by the oppositions show of force on tuesday government supporters fueled thursdays violence to flex their own muscles "a lot of the violence is emanating from pro government supporters " she said aware of the lurking danger political leaders on all sides appealed for restraint druse leader and senior pro government politician walid jumblatt called on the hezbollah allied speaker of parliament to reconvene lawmakers in a bid to resume dialogue the associated press reported the appeals for calm have raised the hopes of some that the violence may serve as a wake up call that brings the leaders of the opposing groups closer but many analysts feel the recent flare up has served only to cement the sectarian divide most troubling they say is that thursdays street clashes signaled that if the situation further deteriorates it may become more difficult for political leaders to control their supporters and stop some from tit for tat attacks already many are accusing saboteurs of infiltrating crowds to instigate violence on friday as calm was restored to beirut television stations affiliated with the opposing camps rehashed thursdays events trading barbed accusations "unfortunately i dont feel that the lebanese leaders have enough awareness wisdom and ability to assess the danger and call for coming together to find a common ground " mr noureddine said
