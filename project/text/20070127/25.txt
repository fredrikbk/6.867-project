hot topic inside bushs energy proposals president bush last week called on the nation to invest in new technology to reduce dependence on foreign oil the president set specific targets for the u s calling for a reduction in gasoline use over the next years he said that a boost in the use of alternative fuels such as ethanol would account for most of that reduction cutting gasoline use by stricter gas mileage standards for vehicles he said should lead to the other reduction the president also proposed doubling the nations strategic petroleum reserves to hedge against oil supply interruptions increased calls for energy independence come as u s oil imports are set to grow from to of the u s supply over the next years according to government projections meanwhile rapidly rising demand in the developing world is likely to keep oil prices high heres a closer look at what the presidents plan would require alternative energy fuel suppliers would have to include billion gallons of alternative fuels such as ethanol in the nations vehicle fuel supply by up from five billion gallons produced last year production of corn based ethanol could reach about billion gallons the rest could come from cellulosic ethanol which uses fibers from switch grass and other natural products or liquefied coal some economists caution that ethanol demand could pressure the corn supply driving up corn prices because of food fuel competition ethanol demand has already increased chicken prices by six cents a pound according to the national chicken council the price of corn of the cost of ethanol production has doubled to nearly &# a bushel over the past six months almost half of the countrys corn harvest could go toward the fuel with the addition of planned ethanol plants in according to the earth policy institute ethanol costs between &# and &# a gallon to produce and is less efficient than gasoline a car running on e fuel reformulated gasoline that is about ethanol gets a third less gas mileage than one running on gasoline the federal government supports ethanol with tax subsidies worth about cents a gallon only about of cars are considered "flex fuel " or capable of running on gasoline or ethanol and even fewer do because less than of the nations gas stations offer e environmentalists are cool to corn based ethanol because it requires so much water energy and land and produces only slightly more energy than it consumes a study by the argonne national laboratory last year found that a car that runs on e produces less greenhouse gas emissions which are thought to cause global warming than one using gasoline cellulosic ethanol on the other hand offers net energy and could reduce emissions but the technology to produce cellulosic ethanol economically hasnt been developed liquefied coal would increase greenhouse gas emissions fuel efficiency the presidents plan proposes reducing consumption by billion gallons over the next years with stricter gas mileage standards reaching that would require a annual increase in fuel efficiency beginning in for cars which would be equivalent to a fuel economy standard of miles a gallon according to the union of concerned scientists currently auto makers fleets must meet an average standard of mpg for cars and mpg for light trucks the light truck standard is already set to increase to mpg by the presidents plan would do away with fleet wide averages and instead assign fuel economy targets to car models based on their size the two proposals present an apparent contradiction because ethanol gets less gas mileage than gasoline mandates for greater use of alternative fuels could undermine efforts to achieve increased fuel economy strategic reserves the u s would more than double its strategic oil reserves to billion barrels over the next years to protect against oil supply disruptions caused by such things as a terrorist attack or natural disaster at full capacity the reserves would represent days of net oil imports up from million barrels today or days the energy department estimates the expansion would cost &# billion with &# billion for purchasing oil and &# billion to build new storage facilities which would join the hollowed out salt domes along the gulf coast nick timiraos points of view for too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil and this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists " president george w bush facts billboards promoting ethanol in the midwest depict an american farmer and a former saudi king and ask "who would you rather buy your gas from " the strategic petroleum reserve is the largest government owned reserve of crude oil in the world brazil the worlds largest ethanol producer has used ethanol from sugarcane to fuel cars under a government program since in the model year five auto makers paid &# million in u s fines for failing to meet fuel economy standards bmw porsche ferrari maserati daimlerchrysler and volkswagen
