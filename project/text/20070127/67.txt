the week ahead our take on coming events washington bush going into the lions den in test of brittle bipartisanship by gerald f seib president bush travels to williamsburg va next saturday to meet with the entire house democratic delegation it will be a real "kumbaya" moment for the nations leaders a sign of a new spirit of bipartisanship in washington well maybe to some extent while it lasts those caveats reflect the uncertain nature of bipartisan cooperation in washington right now almost four weeks into power sharing between a republican president and a democratic congress the rhetoric of bipartisanship at least remains alive and in that spirit mr bush accepted an offer to meet behind closed doors with the houses democrats who will be on their own previously scheduled retreat the presidents appearance was the brainchild of rep rahm emanuel the chairman of the democratic caucus he describes it as "a chance for him to speak to democrats directly confidentially in a personal way " similarly a senior white house aide characterizes the appearance as a way to open some lines of communication which in turn might help build some trust as a former senior adviser in the clinton white house rep emanuel knew that the idea made sense for both sides and that the president could hardly say no for democrats the invitation is an important way to make good at least in a symbolic way on pledges they made to voters to try to work across the aisle for mr bush refusing to walk into the democratic lions den would make him appear to be the one standing in the way of cooperation moreover a meaningful private conversation might be a way to help both sides figure out how much common ground there really is right now its hard to tell democrats in the seat house for example have been getting some republican votes for their legislative initiatives but not overwhelming numbers to raise the minimum wage and to expand embryonic stem cell research but only eight to set up a panel to oversee intelligence spending other quieter steps are happening rep emanuel for instance recently hosted a dinner with moderate republicans and may have other such small sessions but its increasingly obvious there simply wont be any bipartisan understanding on the biggest issue of the year iraq and whatever its extent the bipartisan impulse has a life span that runs at best until this summers august recess after that nearly everything will be tinged by the presidential campaign that leaves limited time and a limited set of issues energy and immigration the most interesting among them for which something bipartisan can actually happen its worth remembering that mr bush has been here before when he became governor of texas democrats controlled both houses of the state legislature mr bush developed a reputation for working the democratic side pretty well and he got meaningful results to show for it thats why talking directly to democrats while at least a few people are still humming "kumbaya " makes sense for both sides technology microsofts vista creeps onto pcs by robert a guth attention shoppers windows vista is here finally on jan microsoft corp will begin broadly shipping the next version of its pc operating system marking a milestone in the software giants history it will be the end of a long hard road for the software giant beset by problems in development vista took too long to finish the whole project was about five years and rattled the foundations of a company that draws the largest portion of its sales and profit from windows for pcs all that will be behind him when microsoft chief executive steve ballmer takes the stage in new york on jan to mark the official launch of the software for the general public it will be sold through retailers and all other channels including the web vista has been available to big businesses since late last year mr ballmer will likely lead a charged up presentation of vistas new bells and whistles but dont expect a sudden surge of vista sales computer users dont move en masse to a new operating system and vista will be no different its a gradual shift as old pcs are replaced college kids pick up new ones for school and small businesses add new employees but its more than a good bet that most people who are using a pc in five years will be using windows vista the companies that make the pc software that people like are making it for windows pcs and will continue to do so for vista pc makers like dell whose livelihood depends on windows will be pitching their wares hard for years to come some are rolling out for vista new pc designs sony corp has a round one that give it a look far more fitting for a consumer electronics product than the boring bone white boxes that have populated homes for decades these changes and the partners behind them help assure the continued dominance of windows still a lot could change apple inc s mac os x is gaining ground albeit slowly against windows as consumers buy macs for the fewer virus problems or to complement their ipod music players and apple isnt resting this spring its expected to roll out a new version of mac os x code named leopard adding fresh competition to vista then theres the web wild card increasingly the internet is being used to deliver software functionality that once would have only been the purview of an operating system like windows that means that google inc and other internet companies could start competing more directly with microsofts core business with vista out the door the windows division now needs to figure out how vistas successor handles those interlopers microsoft executives say they cant afford to wait another five years agriculture at adm all eyes on corn prices by lauren etter at an analysts meeting last november archer daniels midland co s new chief executive patricia woertz warned there might be turbulence ahead as the ethanol market heated up the companys earnings report this coming week will offer the latest sign that she was right corn prices have been flirting with &# a bushel climbing toward record levels and oil prices have dropped since the beginning of the year that isnt great news for ms woertz who came to adm last april trumpeting biofuels as an "exceptional opportunity" for the company and promptly put more of the companys money into renewable fuels the companys stock has slipped nearly since the end of the summer driving season when ethanol consumption is at its peak the consensus on wall street is that adm will report earnings of cents a share for the fiscal second quarter ended dec up from a year earlier driven by higher ethanol profits but down the road one of the largest variables adm will have to contend with is high corn costs which not only could drag down profitability in the companys ethanol business but also could hit its high fructose corn syrup business as well ms woertz who came from chevron corp s top ranks knows margins count already profit margins for ethanol plants have dropped precipitously in light of falling oil prices and rising corn prices the average net profit of a million gallon ethanol plant in the u s dropped to just below two cents a gallon friday down from cents a gallon on jan according to dtn an agricultural commodities research firm in omaha neb adm is counting on farmers to ramp up corn production which could keep corn prices from rising even further on the oil side some in congress have called for a floor on the price of oil to keep the renewable fuels industry afloat the company also has the white house on its side in tuesdays state of the union speech president bush called for even more use of renewable fuels which will certainly include ethanol ms woertz has made it clear she will fight to ensure that the presidents vision becomes law adm is positioned well for the long haul if the oil corn squeeze persists some of the more than ethanol plants in the u s could falter the smaller plants which produce million gallons a year could suffer at the hands of bigger plants such as the two million gallon plants adm is building in iowa and nebraska currently adm of decatur ill has five plants nationwide with the capacity to produce billion gallons of ethanol a year or about of total u s ethanol capacity the companys grain storage and grain transportation business also is likely to benefit in the current ethanol boom corrections &amp amplifications archer daniels midland co has seven ethanol plants in the u s in some editions saturday an article in the week ahead column said the company has five plants wsj jan
