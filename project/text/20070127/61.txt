sales rose an estimated to &# billion according to market researcher npd group but growth slowed sharply in the fall increasing only an estimated in december largely due to the warm winter says marshal cohen chief retail analyst mr cohen predicts theyll increase just this year as women spend more on shoes handbags and electronics the weather could also pose a problem for retailers in the
