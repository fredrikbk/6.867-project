cross country slave wages honolulu nancy pelosi led the effort in the u s house during her first week as speaker to increase the minimum wage to &# per hour from &# in the process she ensured that american samoa a u s territory is exempt from the wage hike but did not exempt the marianas islands the distinction is not unimportant starkist and del monte two big fish and tuna canning companies with packing plants in american samoa are headquartered in california the former in ms pelosis san francisco district these companies pay a federal minimum wage of &# per hour or what will be &# per hour less than what ms pelosi is requiring american businesses on american soil to pay workers but american somoa delegate eni faleomavaega argued that raising the minimum wage "would devastate the local tuna industry " could that not also be the case elsewhere in the country in any event despite strident criticism of ms pelosi for the exemption and her avowal "to make sure that all of the territories have to comply with u s law on the minimum wage " it still carried over into the final legislation but the exemption for american samoa is more curious still even the u s department of labor has noted the governments corruption citing several cases of waste and fraud hawaii u s attorney ed kubo says there is a push for federal law enforcement to take a more active role on that pacific island and hawaiis fbi plans to open an office there to keep a closer watch what is even more ironic about ms pelosis behavior is that the region she is attempting to exempt has historically treated its workers poorly with many instances of human rights abuses and paid them pittances besides look no further than the story of kil soo lee in the korean national incorporated the daewoosa garment factory with the help of togiola tulafono then lieutenant governor mr tulafono is now governor mr lee kept roughly women from vietnam as slaves he was convicted in on counts including extortion money laundering conspiring to violate the civil rights of others and holding workers to a condition of involuntary servitude federal prosecutors called the daewoosa case the biggest "modern day slavery" case in u s history mr lee had devastated hundreds of young girls lives and he had done so with the help of prominent samoan government officials i met mr lee in january flying from hawaii to american samoa with a vietnamese translator to help expose him his "garment factory" and the government who embraced him dozens of young women in the factory told me they paid &# upfront to their government to secure a three year contract to sew designer clothes for &# per month they were promised spacious living quarters with a swimming pool nutritious meals three times daily and substantial wages when they arrived the accommodations crammed people to a poorly ventilated humid hallway lined by tiny bunk beds with half inch mattresses bath facilities offered no privacy and broken toilets the swimming pool was filled with garbage and putrid green slime but poor living conditions wasnt all they were fed a rice and cabbage gruel they were slapped and pinched by guards for minor offenses such as missing a curfew or working too slowly female workers were subject to the whims of mr lee some of them sexual he forced them to clip and manicure his toenails to watch them shower and to "lay" beside them on their bunks the workers often werent paid sometimes for months despite the national labor committee reporting daewoosas sales at &# million in they could not leave the island as mr lee had seized their passports mr lee received special treatment from the government including tax exemptions and a waived bond requirement possibly because of his connection to then lt gov tulafono who was hired to incorporate daewoosa while mr tulafonos wife served for two years on the company board the vietnamese workers told me that when police were called to investigate a beating they walked away with clothes not a report or an arrest ngyen thi nga and dung thi kim vu sought help from attorneys virginia sudbury and christa tzu hsiu lin who took their case in pro bono weeks later both whistleblowers allegedly drowned in rough seas off pago pago although their bodies were never found as new witnesses stepped forward mr lee became more volatile he deported with the cooperation of the vietnamese and samoan governments nine primary witnesses and demanded the arrest of four others tensions were high when samoan guards attacked the vietnamese workers on nov quyen truong was severely beaten with a club stabbed in the eye and blinded associate justice of the high court of american samoa lyle richmond presided over the five week civil trial in which i attended mr richmond ordered mr lee to refund back wages but he did not after national media exposure mr lee was arrested by federal agents deported from american samoa to hawaii on march and held behind bars without bond the indictment claimed mr lee willfully held people in involuntary servitude from feb to december and forced them to work without pay under threats of serious harm and physical restraint in february after a four month trial mr lee was found guilty mr lee appealed he argued that the united states did not have jurisdiction in american samoa the court disagreed and on dec mr lee lost his appeal ms pelosi campaigned heavily for office and her leadership position on a promise of honest government her party supposedly advocates for the blue collar workers but is it honest to exempt american samoa from the minimum wage requirement especially with the documented human rights abuses is it "advocating for the workers" to ensure that their pay is kept considerably lower than their counterparts in the u s in addition to house speaker ms pelosi can add "ethically challenged" to her resume ms zimmerman is president of hawaii reporter a honolulu based newspaper
