pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece all the right moves the queens gambit by walter tevis is a great chess novel and a shrewdly observed coming of age saga anatomy of a classic are you familiar with that great th century american novelist walter tevis maybe not but youre almost certain to know of the movies made from some of his books "the hustler " in which paul newman played a gifted but star crossed pool player called "fast eddie" felson "the man who fell to earth " with david bowie as a visitor from another planet star crossed in a different way or "the color of money " in which mr newman reprised the role of fast eddie winning an academy award for his performance in a screenplay quite different from mr teviss quieter and much more somberly effective final work published a mere week before his death flawed and vulnerable individuals who possess special gifts appear often in the stories of walter tevis who was what is often called "a writers writer" an artist whose achievement is most keenly appreciated it seems by admiring colleagues and peers mr tevis was born in san francisco in raised partly in kentucky and died in new york city in he wrote four other novels in addition to the three named above every book he wrote was different from the others and each could be claimed by some of this authors fervent champions as a masterpiece but one of these seven books not a best seller and never yet made into a film seems special above even all the others it continues to please old readers and win new ones years after first publication though not a mystery novel it hums with suspense and is a favorite with detective fiction readers and writers including martin cruz smith who once deemed it "more exciting than any thriller ive seen lately" and "beautifully written " though not a self consciously literary novel its partisans include the esteemed michael ondaatje who was quoted as saying "it is a book i reread every few years for the pure pleasure and skill of it " the book is "the queens gambit" a novel jonathan lethem has called "walter teviss most consummate and heartbreaking work " published in "the queens gambit" was written as a period piece it covers years roughly to in the life of beth harmon a kentucky girl orphaned and institutionalized at the age of eight who becomes a chess prodigy in the course of getting adopted graduating from public high school and taking her first steps into a sometimes perilous "contemporary" world appropriately "the queens gambit" has been hailed as a great chess novel along with vladimir nabokovs "the defense" and stefan zweigs "the royal game " but it is also a realistic coming of age saga full of bittersweet poignancy and shrewdly observed detail one need not believe me know anything about chess to be gripped every time by "gambit"s closely written game accounts the contests become vivid through mr teviss clear prose and through the quick thoughts and sensations of beth who is drawn to chess when she sees it being played by the janitor of the orphanage where shes housed chess with its contained yet limitless vistas becomes her refuge and alternate world not more real but as real as the mundane or treacherous everyday one beth harmon proves such a natural inhabitant of this alternate plane that she performs as brilliantly on a tournament stage as in an orphanage basement or while speaking chess moves aloud without benefit of a board or simply while visualizing them in her head a quick example from one of beths early tournaments "after a minute she saw that if she attacked on both flanks simultaneously as morphy did sometimes goldmann would have difficulty playing it safe she played pawn to queen rook four "it worked after five moves she had opened his king up a little and after three more she was at his throat she paid no attention to goldmann himself or to the crowd or to the feeling in her lower abdomen or the sweat that had broken out on her brow she played against the board only with lines of force etched for her into its surface the small stubborn fields for the pawns the enormous one for the queen the gradations in between just before his clock was about to run out she checkmated him " over and over mr tevis delivered moments of subtle power and sudden emotion all the more effective for being like beths best moves unexpected the endgame he plotted and played for "the queens gambit" is as thrilling as a superb piece of chamber music walter tevis seems to have resembled one of his own books protagonists a brilliant talent in a very mortal frame a man who struggled with life and his own nature its hard to imagine beths substance abuse scenes being written by anyone whod not himself wallowed in the valley of the shadow of one addiction or another and who pushed through to craft exciting and immensely moving stories that have stayed alive longer than their creator maybe a writers writer is after all what a readers writer always ought to be mr nolan is the author of "ross macdonald a biography" and editor of "the couple next door collected short mysteries by margaret millar "
