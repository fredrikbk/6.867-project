the weekend interview with gary kasparov the other russia new york as the longtime world chess champion garry kasparov was a famously aggressive player his latest game is politics and his style is equally aggressive "our goal is to dismantle the regime " he says speaking of the political coalition he leads to bring down vladimir putin mr kasparovs putin antipathy is well known to readers of this newspaper of which he is a contributing editor "i was wrong about putin " was the headline on his jan op ed article for this page one year into mr putins presidency mr kasparov sounded an early warning about a man whose "kgb roots have informed a style of governance that is neither reformist nor particularly democratic " since then mr kasparov has scarcely let up retiring from chess in march in part to devote himself to politics mr kasparovs new occupation is not without its perils a thought that occurred to me as we arranged to meet earlier this month at his newly refurbished apartment in an art deco building on a smart street in midtown manhattan its a neighborhood replete with sushi bars of the sort that bring to mind ghoulishly the late alexander litvinenko who was poisoned with polonium the doorman announces me and mr kasparov greets me at the door we are old interlocutors i was present at his first meeting with the editorial board in march and was his editor at the journal for years so we kiss twice once on each cheek not three times as is the custom in moscow after his wife serves tea in bone china english cups not a la russe in glasses i ask mr kasparov about the risks "look " he says "there are certain moments in your life when you should forget calculations and do what you believe is your moral duty i knew that the choice would be dangerous thats why our baby was born here im prepared to take all the risk but if i can avoid some i do " the kasparovs have a three month old daughter "the other russia" is the name of the unlikely left right coalition conceived by mr kasparov in and founded last year it is composed of groups that would normally be at political odds democrats like mr kasparov nationalists socialists even bolsheviks mr kasparov predicts that the communist party will join up before the end of the year "theres still a lot of distrust " he says with more than a modicum of understatement "its a problem but i dont think its insurmountable the big advantage of the other russia and i think its our biggest accomplishment is that weve established the principle of compromise which was not yet seen in russian politics it was always confrontation it was a mentality of a civil war we eliminated it " a declaration at the time of the other russias organizing conference last summer reads "we are gathering together because we are united in our disagreement with the current political course of the kremlin and united in our alarm for the present and future of our country " the groups sole objective is to find a candidate to run and win in the march presidential elections or as mr kasparov puts it with characteristic bluntness "when a liberal democracy is re established everybody goes his or her way " the russian constitution forbids mr putin from running for a third term though that doesnt quell widespread speculation that the president will ignore the rule of law and do so anyway he "has the administrative resources" to do so mr kasparov agrees but it would be at the price of his legitimacy both in the west and at home "i dont think putin wants to take such a chance " mr kasparov believes mr putins "mentality is just to run away with all the russian billionaires this is the richest ruling elite in the world they are way ahead of the saudi princes they are mega rich when youre so rich you have to make sure that your funds are safe " but "if putin goes then who will be in charge thats a big problem then its instability an authoritarian regime cannot have a successor while the big name mr putin is still alive much less well young and strong " as the new year unfolds mr kasparov predicts "a political crisis" in mr putins government along with "less stability more uncertainty " thats the opening for the other russia "we should keep our group together close to the wall to get into the hall when its broken but not too close to be buried under the debris " and then "if the other russia wins who cares the victory of the other russia candidate destroys the legacy of any institution built under putin you have to start from scratch you have to call new parliamentary elections you have to introduce new laws you have to undergo judicial reform you have to destroy censorship " in short you have to start over back to where russia was before mr putin took over building democracy block by block the next step for the other russia mr kasparov says is to come up with a platform and work out the rules for selecting a presidential candidate tasks that are on the agenda for a conference planned for april the candidate will likely be chosen in another conference in september or october mr kasparov explains at the moment mikhail kasyanov a former prime minister "looks most prominent " and what about garry kasparov is he a candidate its the only time in years of conversations with mr kasparov that ive known him to be less than confident in a reply "so far " he says note the "so far" "so far i dont think my personal participation helps the coalition because so far" another one "i keep the position of moderator i keep balance of different forces if i step into the game that might jeopardize the whole coalition " in the course of our discussion mr kasparov refers often to the lack of a free press in russia so how then will the other russia get its message across "the role of internet is growing " he says "mobile telephones are not unique anymore not even in rural villages " but and the master chess player may have too much confidence in the analytic abilities of ordinary russians here "more important is growing malcontent people are getting really unhappy and if theyre unhappy theyll listen " mr kasparov is far more worried about money which is short but "i think in we will see a major influx of our financial support from within russia because people can see that the ground is shaky " the other russia wont touch "politically exposed money " he says and emphatically denies that exiled oligarch boris berezovsky is a donor but in the end he says "you know you cant buy political support either you are the right man at the right place at the right time or no money helps you " more political naivete our hour nearly at an end conversation drifts back to the early s and the discussions we used to have about russia and its future is there something the u s might have done differently back then i ask that would have helped keep russia on the path to democracy mr kasparov gives a wry smile "i think the best thing the u s could have done was to get saddam hussein years earlier " he says "by going after saddam in i think we could have saved yugoslavia from a civil war and could have sent a message a very powerful message to many dictators in the united states was much stronger and everybody else was much weaker " the decision to let saddam stay in power happened under the watch of president george h w bush whom mr kasparov isnt shy about criticizing but hes far more scathing about president bill clinton "during the clinton years the united states did virtually nothing in the international arena there were a lot of activities but when you look at the core events i think the influence was irrelevant leadership there was no leadership there was a big window of opportunity to show leadership in in those years the whole world was in an ambiguous state after the cold war it was a new world and it required leadership the way winston churchill and harry truman showed it in world war ii missing this chance and playing sporadically you know boom boom you play one move here one move there the united states was asleep " what advice does he have for george w bush about helping russian democracy today "stay neutral " comes the swift reply the "worst thing" that happened to the democracy movement he says was the inclusion of russia in the group of democracies now the g a designation he cant bring himself to utter now washington should take that position that "there must be an election under the russian constitution putin must go and elections should be held period thats enough theres no double standard obey the constitution thats it " in addition to his work with the other russia mr kasparov continues to write books about chess hes up to volume six in a series about his great predecessors and he has a mass market book coming out this year called "how life imitates chess " about the decision making process in chess business politics and history but at least for now politics has taken the place of chess as the big game in his life "i just dont see any other choice for me " he says "as i used to say for years i am defending the colors of my country im still doing the same just not at the chessboard at a much larger board " ms kirkpatrick is a deputy editorial page editor at the wall street journal
