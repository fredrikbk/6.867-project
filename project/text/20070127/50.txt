pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink a drinks french connection if any cocktail out of the ocean of drinks that floats the play is remembered from "auntie mame " it is the martini in one of the plays set pieces kneepants aged patrick dennis greets the dour banker who is the trustee of his inheritance "would you care for a martini mr babcock " soon the boy has a pitcher full of gin and ice which he stirs carefully "stir never shake " says young pat explaining that shaking "bruises the gin " the stage directions detail just how refined a martini the child has learned to make from his aunt mame "young pat uncorks the vermouth pours a smidgen into the glass swills it around by rotating the stem then empties it completely " babcock is duly flabbergasted but sophisticated as it may be the martini is far too austere for a woman of mames extravagant sensibilities its a gray flannel suit of a cocktail and mame dennis prefers paris silks when she awakes fuzzy from a party the night before and desperately in need of "fuel " mame asks for "a light breakfast black coffee and a sidecar " the sidecar cognac cointreau and lemon juice was born in paris and though the drink entered the american repertoire it has never lost its continental panache when grace kelly and prince rainier iii of monaco announced their engagement in the celebrity press detailed their every move right down to their drinks in the style of a very modern american woman kelly drank vodka on the rocks but smitten as he was rainier did not succumb to the impulse to have what she was having the prince indulged his old world prerogative and drank an aristocratic sidecar the elegance of the sidecar was put to use by w h auden in s "paid on both sides " the poem play is a mash up its energy generated by jarring juxtapositions so when a couple of bloodlusty killers from the provinces of englands north step inside for a drink after a murder the one called culley ever so politely says "ill have a sidecar thanks " the standard creation myth for the sidecar is that it was first concocted in world war i for an officer just arrived in paris from the front having ridden all the way in a motorcycle sidecar the location of this conception is alternately given as the bar at the paris ritz or that other parisian institution harrys new york bar a competing tale came from travel and society writer basil woon who claimed to be present when the first sidecar was born john the bartender at a bistro called henris staggered into work late and bleeding after a motorcycle accident woon ordered cognac his friend ordered cointreau and the woozy barman accidentally mixed them the creation was named after the sidecar in which the bartender had been addled after the war the sidecar gradually gained momentum in the city of its birth in the early s the monkey gland half gin half orange juice and a splash each of pernod and grenadine was the most popular cocktail in paris but the sidecar was close on its heels a decade later the monkey gland was largely forgotten but the sidecar was such a standard that it became something of an emblem for the parisian lush life of the s in those days "paris was no longer the city of widows but the place to which one went for a drink a dance or a divorce " woon wrote "the pipers were playing skirts were short francs were cheap " the author of such essential interwar ephemera as "when its cocktail time in cuba " woon was sobered up by the outbreak of world war ii in he penned an earnest hagiography "roosevelt world statesman " contemplating the presidents many virtues woon found himself in a hair shirt mood "i am not proud " he said of having spent so much time chronicling "the birth of the side car cocktail " who can blame a lowly drinks scribbler for his regrets better to think of paris in the s thats when the young poet elizabeth bishop moved there at first dabbling in pernod that pale imitation of the famously poet ruining drink absinthe bishop decided that pernod was "not a ladies drink " but the other french staples vermouth and dubonnet bored her according to biographer brett c millier and so instead she and her girlfriend louise crane acquired a cocktail shaker and soon had "an excellent side car before our excellent dinner every night " what is an excellent sidecar for starters it is rare the drink is one of the most regularly ruined in the canon ask for a sidecar at just about any bar these days and you will get an orangey lemonade concocted of triple sec and bottled sweet and sour mix yes some cheap brandy will be in there too but youd never be able to taste it even with the right ingredients decent cognac cointreau and fresh lemon juice the orange liqueur and tart lemon tend to monopolize the drink we can blame a certain mr macgarry the bucks club bartender who popularized the drink in london right after the war his recipe soon engraved in numerous english bar books called for equal parts of the three ingredients a ratio that buries the brandy the postwar sidecar recipe common in paris four parts cognac to one part cointreau and one part lemon juice makes for a far superior drink to tame the tang of the lemon give the rim of the cocktail glass a light dusting of superfine sugar or instead add a half part of simple syrup to the mix email me at eric felten wsj com sidecar  oz cognac oz cointreau oz fresh lemon juice oz simple syrup optional to taste shake with ice and strain into a stemmed cocktail glass the rim of which has been dusted with superfine sugar or omit the sugar on the rim and include the quarter ounce of sugar syrup in the shaker a venerable variation on the drink substitutes fresh lime juice for the lemon
