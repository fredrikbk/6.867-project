pursuits food &amp drink a politically incorrect fish makes a comeback wal mart to bring back chilean sea bass but critics see a mixed message on overfishing one of the most politically incorrect foods is about to get a big boost from the worlds largest retailer wal mart stores which has been working to burnish its environmental credentials says it will restore chilean sea bass to its seafood counters in select markets in coming months the retailer stopped carrying the fish in amid concerns that it was being overfished into extinction wal marts turnabout follows a decision by whole foods market in october to sell chilean sea bass for the first time since its the latest twist in the extraordinary history of a fish that went from being an unwanted and physically ugly bycatch to a culinary delicacy to massively overfished in a decade some environmental activists are already criticizing wal marts decision a potentially difficult situation for the company which has suffered public relations missteps and is now engaged in a broad image campaign both wal mart and whole foods say they are putting chilean sea bass back on their shelves because their supply comes from a single fishery near antarctica that has been certified as sustainable by the london based marine stewardship council but the certification is controversial and critics say they are worried that seeing the fish in giant retailers will send a signal to consumers that the overfishing crisis has abated while the one certified fishery is well managed says gerry leape of the national environmental trust it produces only about a tenth of the total legal harvest elsewhere overfishing and poaching remain rampant "wal mart has million customers every week so there wont be enough " says mr leape "one of the things we worry about is what are they going to do when they need more " wal mart pledged in february to buy all of the wild caught fish for its north american stores from fisheries certified by the msc within three to five years the pledge is one of many wal mart has made as part of its green initiative which was formalized in response to its employees efforts to help victims of hurricane katrina in and heavily publicized by the retailer and its outside public relations firm edelman the program also stands to blunt criticism of the retailers practices in other areas such as the quality of the pay and benefits it provides employees wal mart says the source of its chilean sea bass will be clearly marked "the product will be identified and carry the msc certified label so that consumers can make an educated choice " says spokeswoman karen burk whole foodss national seafood coordinator david pilot says he hopes demand for certified fish will lead to changes at fisheries roger berkowitz the owner of legal seafood a boston based chain that does not serve the fish says consumers will get a mixed message "its far too complicated to tell consumers that a fish is okay to eat if it comes from one place but not okay if it comes from anywhere else " he says the potential for problems with chilean sea bass has everything to do with the fish itself a white fleshed creature that doesnt taste fishy and holds up to nearly every cooking method mr berkowitz says if he were willing to serve it it would become the most popular item on the menu but these fish are particularly vulnerable to overfishing because they dont reproduce until they are or more years old so when runaway popularity fueled overfishing much of it by pirate fishermen stocks were decimated many of the nations best known seafood restaurants dont serve chilean sea bass and say certification wont alter their policy "id love to serve it again " says chef rick moonen of rm seafood in las vegas "but im not going to do it until the fishery as a whole is properly managed " darden restaurants which owns the red lobster chain reached a similar conclusion "its going to take a lot more than one fishery to get us to begin thinking about" returning the chilean sea bass to menus says george williams dardens vice president for environmental affairs the certified fishery isnt large enough to ensure a steady supply to red lobsters nearly outlets he says kris hudson contributed to this article
