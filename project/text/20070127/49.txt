thats the most recent campaign he has analyzed by those categories but this year "the diversity of the democratic pool may well expand the donor universe" for the party mr green said bursts in ethnic racial and gender giving inspired by a particular candidate have happened before in blacks and women rallied around the democratic candidacies of the rev jesse jackson and former colorado rep patricia schroeder while the partys eventual nominee michael dukakis was energizing the greek community but the political coming of age of todays candidates coincides with growing economic clout and political savvy among constituencies new to the fund raising game in black households and hispanic households had earnings of more than &# according to the bureau of labor statistics last year that number exceeded million apiece for blacks and hispanics and today the largest political action committee in the country is emilys list an organization of women that directed more than &# million last year to

aggressively expand their potential donor pools the campaign is starting unusually early the field is unusually crowded and the fund raising total each candidate needs to show to appear credible is unusually high some campaigns are expected to show fund raising totals surpassing &# million by march when the first disclosure reports are due campaign finance experts expect the leading contenders

further raised the fund raising stakes by declaring that she wont take public financing in the general election if she wins the nomination so she is seeking donations now for both the primaries and the general campaign to be sure not all donors follow race or gender patterns the clinton campaign is fighting hard to keep big african american donors from mr obama robert johnson the founder of black entertainment television is very close to mrs clintons camp but mrs clinton also must fend off other candidates seeking high profile women backers kate michelman a leader in the abortion rights movement has become an adviser to candidate john edwards the partys vice presidential candidate in interviews ms michelman has said she admires mrs clinton but based her decision to back mr edwards on more than just gender among the new presidential donors being drawn in by this years diverse field of candidates is michael lawson an african american attorney in los angeles with skadden arps slate meagher &amp flom llp mr lawson met mr obama in over lunch at los angeless peninsula hotel the meeting was arranged by anne marie wilkins wife of harvard university law professor david wilkins and mr lawson soon set out to generate more money ultimately raising about &# for mr obamas senate campaign now he is stepping for the first time into the presidential fund raising arena serving on mr obamas presidential finance team "you have a lot of people who really believe that this is a candidate who can win the general election " said mr lawson "given that possibility we need to do all that we can to put him in a position to do just that " vivienne laborde an african american attorney in skaddens new york office is willing to make the jump to presidential fund raising as well she first encountered mr obama by teleconference when he attended a fund raiser late in the senate race at skaddens chicago office that was wired into the los angeles and new york offices "i think this is an opportunity to make history " she said noting that she is already fielding emails from friends both inside and outside the black community willing to work for mr obama in seattle an obama fund raiser held by high tech executives during his senate bid drew about people half of whom were first time givers and most of the newcomers were african americans they are now planning to host another event for his presidential campaign says michael parham associate general counsel for realnetworks inc on wall street many of the industrys top african american executives are aligned with the home state campaign of mrs clinton but a younger generation of executives got their first taste of politics last year during former rep harold fords unsuccessful bid for a tennessee senate seat and deval patricks successful bid to become the first black governor of massachusetts now they are considering hosting a fund raiser for mr obama "when i think about barack and harold and all these young turks they are my contemporaries and that makes me want to get involved " said godfrey gill managing partner of keel capital a hedge fund gov richardson meanwhile is targeting hispanic donors who emerged during the election of los angeles mayor antonio r villaraigosa among those leading the effort will be henry cisneros former cabinet secretary during the clinton administration "my natural inclination was to come home to the clinton team but with bill richardson in the mix i feel a deeper obligation to stick with bill as long as he is viable we have an obligation to give a legitimate and serious hispanic candidate a real chance " said mr cisneros who conveyed those feelings to former president clinton at a recent lunch the new america alliance will be a prime vehicle in mr cisneross fund raising strategy in he helped found the group of about businesspeople "with substantial resources" to leverage backing for education business philanthropic and other programs in the hispanic community the groups members have also engaged politically donating money to the three hispanics in the u s senate two democrats and one republican and in the los angeles mayors race but for many members this year could mark their first entry into presidential politics mr richardsons candidacy "helps unleash new money " said mr cisneros another party veteran aligning with mr richardson is edward romero who was an active democratic donor in the clinton era and was appointed by president clinton as ambassador to spain in he reduced his political activity in the past two presidential cycles but hes now fielding calls from old friends who want to help mr richardson he cites as an example philadelphia attorney nelson diaz a former state judge whom he hadnt spoken to in years "im going to go back to those rolodexes " said mr romero "even if i dont remember them im going to call them " womens groups had been awaiting mrs clintons official entry for months at emilys list founder ellen malcolm fired
