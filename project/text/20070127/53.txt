pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations hes got guts we all complain and with justice about the falseness of much that is said in washington and the cowardice that leaves a great deal unsaid but i found myself impressed and grateful for the words of chuck hagel the republican senator from nebraska in a meeting of the foreign relations committee on wednesday because his message was not one republicans or democrats would find congenial it may be accidentally dropped down the memory hole so ill quote at some length the committee was nearing a vote on what was essentially an announcement of no confidence in the administrations leadership in iraq specifically it was a nonbinding resolution opposing the increase in troops the president has requested this was not significant in a concrete way the president has the power to send more troops and they are already arriving but as symbols go it packed a punch you couldnt watch it on television or on the internet and not see that mr hagel was letting it rip he did not speak from notes or a text but while looking at his fellow senators there seemed no time lag between thought and word he was barreling he was giving it to you straight and hed pick up the pieces later this is what he said congress has duties in the case of the war meeting those duties was not convenient congress did not meet them and so "the congress has stood in the shadow of this issue iraq for four years as john warner noted we have a constitutional responsibility as well as a moral responsibility to this country to the young men and women we ask to go fight and die and their families this is not a defeatist resolution this is not a cut and run resolution were not talking about cutting off funds not supporting the troops this is a very real responsible addressing of the most divisive issue in this country since vietnam "sure its tough absolutely and i think all senators ought to be on the line on this what do you believe what are you willing to support what do you think why are you elected if you wanted a safe job go sell shoes "this is a tough business but is it any tougher us having to take a tough vote express ourselves than what were asking our young men and women to do i dont think so " later "i dont question the presidents sincerity his motivations in this i never have part of the problem that we have i think is because we didnt we didnt involve the congress in this when we should have and im to blame every senator whos been here the last four years has to take some responsibility for that "but i will not sit here in this congress of the united states at this important time for our country and in the world and not have something to say about this i dont ever want to look back and have the regret that i didnt have the courage and i didnt do what i could "i would go back to where i began and pick up on a point that chairman richard lugar mentioned coherence of strategy i dont know how many united states senators believe we have a coherent strategy in iraq i dont think weve ever had a coherent strategy in fact i would even challenge the administration today to show us the plan that the president talked about the other night there is no plan i happen to know pentagon planners were on their way to the central com over the weekend they havent even team bd this plan and i want every one of you every one of us senators to look in that camera and you tell your people back home what you think dont hide anymore none of us "that is the essence of our responsibility and if were not willing to do it were not worthy to be seated right here we fail our country if we dont debate this we are not worthy of our country " whenever the camera shot broadened to show the other senators i wondered what they were thinking for a few it might have been well done chuck for others hey righteous indignation is my act and some would have been thinking thats good ol buddy and no matter how long i have to wait ill get you for putting me on the spot for making us look bad for getting on your high horse and charging but mr hagel said the most serious thing that has been said in congress in a long time this is what were here for this is why were here to decide to think it through and take a stand and if we cant do that why dont we just leave and give someone else a chance mr hagel has shown courage for a long time he voted for the war resolution in but soon after began to question how it was being waged this was before everyone did he also stood against the war when that was a lonely place to be senate democrats sat back and watched if the war worked theyd change the subject and if it didnt theyd hang it on president bush republicans did their version of inaction they supported the president until he was unpopular and then peeled off this is almost not to be criticized its what politicians do but its not what mr hagel did he had guts a note too on john kerry who on the floor of the senate also talked about iraq this week and said he would not run for president clearly he saw the lipstick writing on the wall this is the year of the woman he also might have been acting on the sense that this is a time of ongoing and incipient political flux the major parties seem as played out as they are ruthless and the arc of political fame is truncated nobodies become somebodies become has beens before half the country knows their name the democrats have no idea what they stand for the republicans only remember what they stood for but there was mr kerry liberated by the death of a dream and for once quite human as he tried to tell it the way he actually saw it took the mock right out of me good for him and for mr hagel i wonder if we are seeing the start of a new seriousness
