the deal has become a crucial referendum on whether shareholders are getting a windfall when publicly traded companies are taken private or whether investment firms are snatching up properties on the cheap in clear channels case for example some major shareholders feel they stand to make more money by holding the stock for the long haul than by cashing out now even at a premium to the current share price they reason that if the company is so valuable the buyers are willing to put up their own money why should they want to sell it "its not only a company issue its a systematic issue " says henry ellenbogen co fund manager of the t rowe price media and telecommunications fund and a significant shareholder in clear channel communications and recently in clear channel outdoor "as a marketplace you cant have an asset where people run it poorly and put in incentives for them to cash it out at a lower price" than what the company could be worth if run differently hundreds of billions of dollars have changed hands in the current private equity rush and most deals have been approved with little investor resistance but after years of outsized returns for buyout shops the tide appears to be turning in the direction of what shareholders call "self help " that means having the companies themselves mimic the moves private equity firms are making including loading up on debt tightly reining in costs and shedding key assets they do so however at the risk of passing up healthy if not optimal premiums in favor of gains that may be years down the road if they arrive at
