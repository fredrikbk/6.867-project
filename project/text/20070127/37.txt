mexicos oil output cools slowing of major field may pressure prices u s import diversity mexico city daily output at mexicos biggest oil field tumbled by half a million barrels last year according to figures released friday by the mexican government the ongoing decline at the cantarell field could pressure prices on the global oil market complicate u s efforts to diversify its oil imports away from the middle east and threaten mexicos financial stability the virtual collapse at cantarell the worlds second biggest oil field in terms of output at the start of last year is unfolding much faster than projections from mexicos state run oil giant petroleos mexicanos or pemex cantarells daily output fell to million barrels in december compared to million barrels in january according to figures from the mexican energy ministry mexico made up for some of the fields decline mexicos overall oil output fell to just below three million barrels a day in december down from almost million barrels at the start of the year it marked mexicos lowest rate of oil output since mexicos troubles at cantarell mirror the larger problems in the global oil market many of the worlds biggest fields are old and face decline which can be sharp and sudden like other big producers mexico is struggling to make up the difference because new big fields are in harder to reach places like the deep waters of the gulf of mexico the fields decline is expected to continue if not worsen this year according to most estimates that will subtract valuable oil from the world market which is under pressure from rising demand by growing economies like china and india it also means less oil headed to the u s from mexico which has long relied on mexico as one of its top three oil suppliers "this is bad news for mexico the field is declining faster than even the governments pessimistic scenarios " says david shields an oil industry consultant in mexico city who has been warning about cantarells collapse for the past two years the decline is especially worrisome for mexicos new president felipe calderon who won a narrow victory in last years election that his main opponent didnt accept causing brief political unrest any major decline in output or prices will force him to cut government spending a politically unpopular move growth in mexicos economy is already expected to slow this year thanks to a u s slowdown mexicos declining production also will raise the pressure on mr calderon to crack open the countrys closed energy market to allow private investors to help pemex find new oil deposits but the former energy minister will have a tough time convincing an opposition dominated congress to rewrite mexicos constitution the countrys oil expropriation of is part of mexicos self image a year ago the wall street journal published an internal pemex study that reviewed possible scenarios at cantarell the studys best case scenario forecast cantarells production would fall to million barrels a day by the end of last year almost exactly what happened at the time top pemex officials disputed the report and said the studys scenario represented a "do nothing" or "worst case" approach that didnt take into account maintenance at the field pemex predicted that cantarell production would only drop to million barrels a day by december and that overall output at the company would actually grow to million barrels a day since then pemex has said it can offset declines at cantarell with new production from other fields mexicos growing economy is demanding more fuel each year which is expected to translate to even lower oil exports last year mexicos daily average oil exports fell to million barrels a day from million the previous year pemex says it expects daily exports to fall to an average million barrels this year but some analysts say that is too optimistic decembers daily exports were a meager million barrels while that figure may have been affected by bad weather that closed some ports it was already well below pemexs estimates for this year based on the state companys track record so far at cantarell including its current rates of recovering the oil that remains in the field mr shields expects the fields output to drop another barrels a day by the end of this year he says that pemex will likely increase output by barrels a day at other fields leaving the country with a net decline of barrels a day by years end and daily exports of less than million barrels none of this is welcome news in a country that relies on oil exports for some of government revenue so far relatively high oil prices have kept the country from feeling the effects of lower output but prices could continue a recent drop adding to mexicos woes from a production shortfall this years mexican budget is based on pemexs official production targets as well as a relatively high oil price about &# on the world market in many older oil fields companies inject gas to keep the pressure in the wells high and the oil flowing in the case of cantarell mexico injected vast quantities of nitrogen in the past few years but the gas can only do so much and using it means the decline in production can be sudden and sharp in the case of cantarell which lies in the shallow waters of the gulf experts say that seawater is fast invading the wells corrections &amp amplifications a internal study by mexican state run oil company petroleos mexicanos or pemex forecast various scenarios for falling output at the countrys cantarell oil field including a base case or most likely scenario an article saturday about mexicos oil output incorrectly referred to that forecast as a best case scenario wsj feb
