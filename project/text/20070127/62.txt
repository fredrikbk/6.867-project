pursuits travel skiing helicopter parents hit the slopes to court families with kids heli ski operators try a different pitch fumbling with an avalanche beacon for a recent vacation pamela rae found a ski resort with wood burning stoves in the rooms gourmet food and a game room to keep her kids entertained one thing it didnt have a chair lift instead ms rae and her children ages and were picked up by helicopters and taken to remote foot peaks in the canadian backcountry where they snowboarded deep untouched powder every day for almost a week "youre the only people out there " says ms rae who runs a small skin care business in malibu calif heli skiing has grown rapidly in recent years by catering to adrenaline junkies who crave fresh powder now the industry is courting a very different customer families with kids as young as who are usually more apt to vacation at places like aspen or vail its a tricky balancing act for the heli ski business which has previously played up the risk factor to attract the extreme sports crowd but now has to convince moms and dads that the sport is safe and practical for kids the trips are pricey they typically cost between &# and &# for a day of skiing compared with about &# for a lift ticket at the fanciest traditional resorts some operators have their own dedicated resorts while others book clients into local hotels and lodges as part of a package starting last year canadian mountain holidays a heli ski operator in british columbia began offering discounts for kids and under during holidays some families came this past christmas other places like diamond peaks heli ski adventures which operates trips outside salt lake city will for a fee provide an extra guide so one can hang back with the kids while another skis up front with the adults some resorts have even started grooming some runs to make them easier for beginners mike wiegele helicopter skiing in blue river british columbia offers mountain top lessons for pre schoolers and has added a daycare center thrill seekers still make up the bulk of heli ski customers and resorts run the risk of alienating them if they go too far in the family friendly direction but they dont have much of a choice there are only so many hard core adventure skiers who also can afford to stay at a heli ski resort says ralf garisson who heads mountain travel research project which tracks the ski industry for resorts families on the other hand take holiday vacations religiously and are not afraid to spend on them earlier this month glenn golonka who runs dexter international an investment and holding company in washington d c paid &# for his family to spend a week at mike wiegele first thing in the morning mr golonka and his wife naomi were whisked by helicopter to a mountain with runs that took minutes to get down their daughters tara and siobhan were picked up by a different helicopter and flown to a spot where the terrain is less steep the runs are shorter and there is a groomed slope for beginners after each run a luxury snow cat with a dvd player that was playing the animated movie "cars " met the girls and their instructor at the bottom and ferried them back up mr golonka says the sisters even tried to venture into an ungroomed area but tara was too light to cut through the two feet of powder and the instructor had to pull her down the slope with his pole the same factors that make heli skiing thrilling the wide open terrain and endless deep snow are also what gives it an undercurrent of danger while scientists and heli ski operators are much better at forecasting avalanches than they used to be theres always some risk of a slide because the snow piles up so high canadian mountain holidays for instance has had two avalanches that killed a total of three people over the last years the company wrestled with whether to allow kids but walter bruns the company president says he believes that skiing at a traditional resort is just as dangerous "we thought about that long and hard " he says "we believe that we can operate with a level of safety that allows us to comfortably invite guests and their kids " it is also easier to veer off course on a mountain in the middle of nowhere than on the bunny slopes at beaver creek julia stanley who has been heli skiing with her husband for a decade says twice at mike wiegele her guide skied beyond the helicopter pick up spot in one case they had to hike for minutes before they found the copter the other time her guide known as "big tim " spent about minutes cutting down willow trees with a inch serrated knife to create a landing zone for the helicopter "we made him buy us all drinks " says ms stanley mike wiegele who owns the resort says its common for guides to overshoot the helicopters because they get confused while skiing in and among the trees while some heli skiing resorts are located near big cities others require a second flight or even a five hour car trip accommodations range from simple local hotels to lavish cabins with spas and fine food many skiers book weeklong trips that include food lodging and a package of helicopter trips in a typical day guests ski until lunchtime often fly back to the lodge for lunch and then go back out in the afternoon by the end of the day theyll have skied six to runs many heli ski resorts will allow young kids to come if their parents vouch for their kids skiing abilities and sign a release heli ski operators say the sport is extremely safe guides analyze the probability of a snow slide by building a square column of snow and then hitting it with a shovel to see how easily it breaks every skier sits through an hour long lecture on avoiding avalanches stay as close to each others line down the hill as possible and using avalanche beacons which every person carries if a skier gets buried under the snow their beacons transmit signals that can be picked up by another beacon as mainstream ski resorts become more crowded there were a record million skier visits at u s resorts last year more skiers are looking to get away from the masses many of the heli ski resorts are clustered around british columbia and alaska particularly around valdez though the latter tend to have more extreme terrain in the lower operators run out of a number of states including colorado utah and wyoming alec mackinnon who lives in hingham mass first tried heli skiing when he was in sun valley idaho and had no trouble with the skiing but says he had some trouble with the avalanche beacon while the latest beacons show an arrow telling you from which direction the signal is coming the old ones only told you when you were getting closer to the signal in march alec now is heading to ruby mountain near elko nev for three days of heli skiing with his father d j who says he isnt worried "if somebody went down youve got four other people " he says
