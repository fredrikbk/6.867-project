pursuits books writers block modern not modernist edwin arlington robinson by scott donaldson columbia pages &# in president theodore roosevelt a voracious reader sent a fan letter to a little known poet whose work had caught his eye in closing the letter roosevelt asked "will you permit me to ask what you are doing and how you are getting along " as it happened edwin arlington robinson was not getting along terribly well scribbling away in extreme poverty in boston he had recently returned from a stint working for cents an hour in new york on the citys great subway building project as an inspector he walked miles through dank tunnels every day checking laborers in and out of work and counting deliveries of building materials according to scott donaldsons sterling biography the two dollars a day that robinson made underground may have staved off starvation but the job had the poet complained to a friend "a paralyzing effect" on his mind roosevelt arranged a sinecure for robinson pushing pencils at the custom house in lower manhattan when william howard taft succeeded roosevelt however the job ended robinsons eventual salvation would come through the good graces of various patrons and through his rent free summertime stays at the macdowell colony in peterborough n h where he did most of his writing for nearly a quarter century robinson was a new englander born and bred unlike the transplanted robert frost who was a native of san francisco the maine landscape the source of the fortune that his father made in the lumber business informs much of robinsons writing as does his hometown of gardiner called "tilbury town" in the poems as mr donaldson explains "there were three basic tenets in gardiners creed a devout materialism a strict victorian morality and a puritan work ethic " the first robinson rejected the last two he accepted without question it took time roughly two decades for robinsons halting career to gather momentum beginning meekly with a self published collection of poems an "inconspicuous blue covered little pamphlet " in his description called "the torrent and the night before " in when he was like so many poets starting out robinson amassed a spectacular number of rejection slips "my poetry " he said "is rat poison to editors " poverty excessive drinking depression and the death of both of his parents compounded robinsons burdens unlucky in romance he lost the beautiful emma shepherd to his brother herman who married her and then proceeded to squander the robinson family wealth a bald declaration of love to rosalind richards a young woman from a prominent gardiner family went unreciprocated years later after he became famous robinson would do his own romantic dodging when the celebrated dancer isadora duncan pursued him at harvard where he enrolled as a special student robinson spent a good deal of his time in brothels finding them both alluring and cruel a lifelong bachelor he was taciturn aloof a self described "new england shellfish probably a clam " despite his crossed stars robinson seldom doubted his gift for verse in time his work attracted the attention of established writers such as the poet william vaughn moody and laura richards who assisted him on his rise to prominence in a span of six years during the s robinson won three pulitzer prizes only frost has surpassed him with four by the year of his death in he was considered not only a great american poet but also the first modern poet that this country had produced robinsons stock has fallen sharply since then this may have to do with his particular brand of modernity he was modern without being modernist radical without being technically experimental t s eliot declared him "negligible " as mr donaldson explains robinsons traditional prosody quickly began to look old fashioned he quipped that free verse had come "armed with the devils instructions to abolish civilization " but in his tumultuous portraits of ordinary people robinson swept away the cobwebs of the victorian era "genteel tradition " his red blooded character sketches such as "the clerks " "minever cheevy" and "ruben bright" make eliots portrait of j alfred prufrock indelible as it is seem a bit effete in one such sketch "richard cory " a chorus of townspeople describes the suicide of a polished and well to do man "so on we worked and waited for the light and went without the meat and cursed the bread and richard cory one calm summer night went home and put a bullet through his head " the poet yvor winters thought this a cheap surprise ending but mr donaldson rightly notes that the poem is as much about the envious complaining townspeople as it is about corys mysterious despair mr donaldson does equally well by robinsons "luke havergal " a haunting poem that the poet allen tate called "one of the great lyrics of modern times " the poems spectral speaker mr donaldson argues comes "out of the grave" to encourage havergal to join his departed lover in death "the leaves will whisper there for her and some like flying words will strike you as you fall but go and if you listen she will call " robinson consistently worked to understand human motivations in matters both mundane and extreme robinsons greatest poem "eros turannos " as the title suggests similarly treats the subject of ill fated love in this case an unhappy marriage reminiscent of emmas with his brother herman again a chorus of townspeople observes and comments but the couple does not heed "for they that with a god have striven not hearing much of what we say take what the god has given " the sad couple must accept their lot the chorus concludes "though like waves breaking it may be or like a changed familiar tree or like a stairway to the sea where down the blind are driven " robinsons long poems such as "tristram" and his final work "king jasper " while popular in their day have not aged as well as the short ones a fact reflected in mr donaldsons judiciously selected everymans library edition of the poems through the compression of his lyrics robinson achieves a novelistic density cramming entire life stories and an impressive range of human feeling into a tight space as one contemporary critic put it he is modern poetrys "biographer of souls " mr yezzi is executive editor of the new criterion
