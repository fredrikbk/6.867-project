pursuits leisure &amp arts the sounds of music want a concert seat with good acoustics so does the pianist acoustics are rarely discussed from the concert pianists point of view yet arguably it affects us the most an audience member unhappy with the sound in their part of the auditorium can change seats but we cannot therefore the position of the piano on stage is of utmost importance moving it only a foot in either direction can make an enormous difference in the sound and therefore in the performance as you are rehearsing on stage you wonder why you have spent so much time at home fine tuning the pedaling the dynamics and the tempos when they will all need altering in this new acoustical environment these last minute adjustments remain one of the concert pianists major challenges whatever sound we hear on stage governs our performance and one could almost say becomes our "co creator " if we find the sound to be on the dry side we will probably use more pedal to help add color i will even sometimes try to quicken the tempo ever so slightly to ensure that the music has its proper flow if the sound is too reverberant overly resonant and losing clarity the reverse would apply a different kind of problem presented itself with the building of lincoln centers avery fisher hall in the acousticians seemed to have been interested in a highly articulated clear brilliant treble sound while that might suit much contemporary music works of the classic romantic period of the th century require just the opposite a blending of the notes and the addition of a much needed bass sound which provides the warmth and sense of harmony so crucial to music unfortunately avery fisher which was redone several times still needs improvement there is talk now of yet another renovation the greatest concert halls we have symphony hall in boston carnegie hall in new york and the concertgebouw in amsterdam to name a few combine clarity and brilliance without sacrificing warmth it is interesting that all were built before prior to the availability of scientific instruments apparently the human ear was and for me still is the best instrument of all let me tell you just a few of my own adventures with musics most unpredictable partner acoustics in at a recording session at orchestra hall in chicago with fritz reiner conducting the chicago symphony orchestra i wasnt surprised when i did not hear enough piano sound during a brief rehearsal normally when i had experienced that at rehearsals for concerts there i was not worried since i knew that i would have my "real" piano back with a filled auditorium but in a recording session there is no public to change the acoustics so i quickly had to find a way to get the sound i needed i had seen some sheets of plywood backstage and knowing that wood was the best reflector of sound i asked the stagehand to bring me some one piece was close to perfect it was about inches wide roughly the distance between the keyboard and the lid an area which normally doesnt need any sound reflector when leaned against the left side of the piano near the keyboard it rose a foot above the instrument i sat down and played a few passages it worked it gave me the sound i needed i have never forgotten that piece of plywood it should have gotten credit on the recording when i was years old i played on an important radio program called "the magic key " a celebrated soprano named grace moore was on the same program during rehearsal i saw her putting a cupped hand behind her ear i remember thinking "wow what a strange lady whats she doing " later i realized that she did this to amplify the sound of her voice using her hand as a reflector not only can you hear your own voice better but the voices of others as well try this at a concert and youll have your own personal amplifier vladimir horowitz the great pianist with whom i studied told me how mystified he was when maurice ravel asked him to play a new piece "jeux deau" "the fountain" without using any pedals fortunately it went unheeded otherwise we would have heard a lot of "dry fountains" some years later when visiting ravels home outside paris i had the opportunity to play his piano and after only a few moments understood the puzzling "no pedal" request composers usually write for the conditions at hand in his case the piano was a bechstein grand and the room in which he wrote was small about by feet the sound was so excessively sonorous that no pedal was needed and indeed would have been detrimental so the acoustics in ravels room were the culprit responsible for the "dry fountain " in new york in the summer of i recorded moussorgskys "pictures at an exhibition " his major work for piano several days after finishing i went to the studio to listen to the different takes i happened to choose the ones for the final recording on a friday returning to the studio on monday i was shocked at what i heard everything sounded lifeless and heavy too slow i know we hear things differently on different days but this was too much i asked the crew if they had heard the difference to my relief they had they were as perplexed as i until one of the engineers cried out "i know what the problem is the air conditioner was turned off over the weekend and the speakers have been badly affected by the rooms heat and humidity " there was no point in listening any further until the air conditioner could dry everything out we enjoyed a purposefully long lunch before returning to the studio and to the tapes as if by magic the friday performances were back shortly afterward i was told that the air conditioners would have no more weekends off these are but a few examples of how capricious acoustics can be and when we realize that even fur coats can affect the sound in a hall you can see just how capricious so the next time you complain about the sound in a concert hall pity the poor performers before a recital we must position the piano based on the acoustics of an empty hall not a filled one hopefully we make the right choice no changing of seats for us mr janis a world renowned pianist has written the music for a coming documentary on the friendship between gary cooper and ernest hemingway he is currently working on completing his autobiography
