pursuits sports golf journal nirvana for golf gearheads the sports big show features clubs inventors and chewable tees orlando fla the annual pga merchandise show finishing up here saturday is one of those big unwieldy things like "american culture" or "the golf swing" that is impossible to fully comprehend an estimated people are attending this years show which spreads out over square feet at the orange county convention center and features exhibits from companies im sure that if you took all of something or other on display here club shafts brochures touting "revolutionary new design" and stacked them end to end they would stretch to the moon for golf geeks its a dream on wednesday at the demo day at a acre circular range a few miles west of town attendees could play with all the latest toys the main story this year as i wrote about a few weeks ago is drivers with unorthodox shapes almost every manufacturer is unveiling some bizarre design at the show adams golf calls its squarish new driver the insight bul for "big ugly and long " the retailers and pro shop owners i talked with said they thought golfers would adjust to the new shapes "if they can afford them that is " said tim evans a pro from deerfield beach fla most of the new crop will sell for at least &# but the club makers recognize that the cosmetics need improving alan hocknell the head of club design at callaway told me that his company consulted with bmw in crafting the stealthy contours of its new square headed ft i &# suggested retail back at the main exhibit hall the golf clubs provocatively displayed in the boudoir like mini worlds that the major companies construct for themselves are still the glamour products but other products apparel training aides travel services gadgets and memorabilia occupy more than half the acreage golf celebrities jim furyk paula creamer nancy lopez materialize from time to time to promote their sponsors wares sales reps stand outside the latest generation golf simulators like carnival sidemen inviting passersby to step inside and play a few holes at pebble beach exceptionally pretty young women some wearing not enough clothes offer free items you dont especially want but are happy to take like information about mint scented golf towels typical trade show stuff i suppose the merchandise show began in when club makers backed their cars into a circle at the pgas headquarters on the west coast of florida and took orders from northern pros who were wintering in the state the show isnt open to the general public only to club and teaching pros retailers and the media in recent years attendance has declined somewhat and some club makers notably ping and titleist no longer attend because the business model has changed these days new products are introduced year round and ordered online but according to joe steranka chief executive of the pga attendance is again on a slight upswing as the shows mission has evolved instead of focusing on direct sales manufacturers increasingly are there to educate retailers on the virtues of their products so that they in turn can sell them to you more persuasively so watch out the kickoff event at this years show focused on golfs global economic impact a study reckoned that golf in the u s though not currently booming is a &# billion industry counting golf travel and real estate related expenditures and the industry overseas is growing rapidly especially in asia to my mind the most intriguing exhibit at the show was the great wall of china a stark foot long barricade painted bright red emblazoned with the phrase "golf in china " and that was it apart from a few low tech poster boards touting the countrys new courses and three folding tables set up for conversation with some pretty stern looking chinese delegates the exhibit like everything you hear about china these days was vast in scale underdeveloped and from an economic point of view vaguely ominous like a lot of pga show veterans i find the back aisles to be the most alluring this is where mom and pop outfits rent foot by foot booths for more money than they can spare and cross their fingers that others will recognize the indispensability of their product i have a friend whose father in retirement invented the putter tuck towel which fits over your putterhead in a way that makes it easy to take with you to the green for years he showed it in orlando and did about as well with the towel as one could hope for he ended up getting national distribution but even so with profits of only about &# per unit it was never a business he could have lived on thus in walking these aisles the fascination is partially morbid you admire the creativity behind chewable mint flavored tees even as your heart breaks at the prospects of a business founded on chewable tees breaking even not that lightning doesnt sometimes strike my favorite small product this year was the strike n swipe a sticker that you attach to the face of a club when practicing to see where the ball makes impact the value added is that after each hit you can wipe it clean the inventor victor camaj is a restaurateur from michigan and was clearly thrilled about the response his invention was receiving at the pga show as with golf itself hope trumps grim experience every time email me at golfjournal wsj com
