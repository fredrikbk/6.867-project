pursuits books in hollywoods maw david mamet reports with venom on the state of the movie business bambi vs godzilla by david mamet pantheon pages &# in playwright david mamet wrote and directed the film "state and main " a satire about the effect of a hollywood production on a small town in vermont seen through the eyes of a writer new to the dehumanizing effects of the movie business mr mamets film lampooned producers airhead stars and corrupt politicians mr mamets "bambi vs godzilla" is partly a translation of "state and main" into an entertaining nonfiction diatribe in the movie the executive in charge of the production suggests rewarding an underling with an associate producer credit hearing this the wide eyed writer asks a co worker "whats an associate producer credit " the more experienced hand replies "its what you give your secretary instead of a raise " in "bambi vs godzilla " mr mamet indulges his contempt for producers more fully saying that a typical member of the species flourishes without possessing any discernible talent other than rapaciousness mr mamet claims that he has seen producers practice "theft fraud intimidation malversion with such regularity that its absence provokes not comment but wonder " this is one of the books milder passages of course mr mamet is not always on the attack though usually he is through a series of loosely connected essays he stops to explain for instance how to write a screenplay "almost any film can be improved by throwing out the first ten minutes " he explains as well why movie sequels proliferate "the motion picture megaliths having earned more money than they could have foreseen with the original begin eating their own entrails in a frenzy to earn all the rest " he describes what function movie critics serve theyre a "plague" whose real job is "to sell newspapers" and "defend the status quo " mr mamet has a long history in hollywood from writing screenplays for "the untouchables" and "the verdict" in the s to writing and directing films based on his plays but readers hoping to find mounds of gossip in "bambi vs godzilla" will be disappointed he does give a few examples of whiny stars and cruel producers but he prefers not to name names mr mamet would rather skewer hollywood itself as a sinkhole where standards of loyalty and common sense have disappeared consider his definition of tinsel towns version of the golden rule "feel free to treat everyone like scum for if they desire something from you theyll just have to put up with it and should they rise to wealth and power any past civility shown toward them will either be forgotten or remembered as some aberrant and contemptible display of weakness " mr mamet is equally bleak on the subject of the decline of film art and the triumph of the blockbuster mentality though mr mamet does not go into the sort of detail that edward jay epstein employed in his dissection of hollywood economics "the big picture" he does boil down the drive for bigger and more extravagant spectacles to one solid principle film executives he writes "have incentive to inflate costs as much as possible thus necessarily minimizing the number of films produced bets placed " in their warped thinking mr mamet writes the bigger the budget the safer their jobs "the exculpatory chant of the executive " he says is "how can i take the rap for the failure of this film when i got the most expensive stars and sets and director possible let me try again " if "the big picture" is econ at filmmaker university then "bambi vs godzilla" is psych a newer aspect of hollywoods psychology apparently involves portraying jews as villains or so mr mamet seems to say in a section of the book called "jews in show business " he focuses on the film adaptation of tom clancys "the sum of all fears" in particular this movie is a strange choice for a discussion of anti semitism the israelis in the story are not so much bad guys as careless bystanders the real villains are in fact neo nazis armed with a nuclear weapon it would have been more interesting to have mr mamets take on steven spielbergs "munich" or mel gibsons "the passion of the christ " even more peculiar are mr mamets musings on the success of jews in hollywood "let me see if i can offend several well meaning groups at once " he writes "i will address myself particularly to the racially punctilious and to the goodwilled but otherwise uninvolved champions of the developmentally challenged " after this self conscious preamble he asserts "i think it is not impossible that aspergers syndrome helped make the movies " symptoms of aspergers he says include "early precocity a great ability to maintain masses of information ignorance of or indifference to social norms high intelligence a preternatural ability to concentrate on the minutia of the task at hand " the syndrome "has its highest prevalence among ashkenazi jews and their descendants " he writes in other words "six hundred years of polish rabbis and one hundred of their genetic descendants american film directors " heres betting that mr mamet succeeds in offending several well meaning groups at once and possibly general readers made uneasy by discussions about jews and genetic propensities whatever one makes of doctor mamets diagnosis it is certainly an example of how unfettered his opinionizing can be in general the lack of caution in "bambi vs godzilla" is bracing "the true writer must write not the acceptable but the true " he says discussing the negative reaction to his play "oleanna " which involves a woman filing a false rape accusation he writes "i didnt realize that it was my job to be politically acceptable id always thought society employed me to be dramatic " given that a good portion of any mamet drama depends on the sort of profanity laced verbal pyrotechnics displayed in "glengarry glen ross" and "american buffalo " mr mamet is curiously dismissive of the spoken word in films describing the film shorts featuring laurel and hardy he writes "these to me are the perfection of essential moviemaking perfect simple plot no distracting jabber or dialogue as it is more generally known " he urges budding screenwriters not to worry so much about jabber as about other things such as aesthetic distance a condition that "allows the audience to suspend its judgment " he also urges writers to ask three simple questions as they compose their plots and screenplays "who wants what from whom what happens if they dont get it why now " mr mamet appears to doubt that hell ever get what he wants from hollywood this book filled with eccentric keen uncompromising insights is what happened as a result why now possibly because the movie business needs to hear it mr bunch is an assistant editor at the weekly standard in washington
