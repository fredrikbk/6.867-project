intel alters computer chip recipe change in materials seeks increased speed and power efficiency intel corp is on the verge of a significant change in the way it makes computer chips an advance in manufacturing technology that competitors are vowing to match the silicon valley company was to announce saturday that it will replace materials it has used for decades in its next production process which is scheduled to begin churning out chips during the second half of this year intel claims the change will bring big gains in chip speed while controlling power consumption continuing a pace of progress that has helped boost the capabilities of personal computers and other products but rivals arent conceding that intel has an advantage international business machines corp for example on saturday was to announce a similar shift in manufacturing technology by early texas instruments inc says it expects to make the change at roughly the same time since the s companies have raced to shrink the size of transistors the elements on chips that switch on and off or store data to carry out basic electronic functions making transistors smaller simultaneously increases their speed and data storage capacity while lowering manufacturing cost the most advanced chips in production now have transistors and other circuitry with dimensions of nanometers or billionths of a meter getting to the next technology generation which will shrink circuit dimensions to nanometers presents new obstacles at those microscopic sizes electrical current can begin to leak uncontrollably from transistors causing problems such as rapidly draining the batteries of laptop computers companies have long discussed the need to adopt new materials to head off the problem but exactly when they would make the difficult transition wasnt clear intel whose revenue makes it the worlds biggest chip maker is now disclosing that it will use two new materials for making transistors when its factories begin gearing up production of nanometer chips this year they will replace silicon dioxide and polycrystalline silicon materials derived from the widely found element silicon that is the basic ingredient in most chips the company is identifying one of the new materials as hafnium a silvery element sometimes used in the control rods in nuclear reactors intel said it is also adding two metals in making transistors but isnt disclosing what they are for competitive reasons mark bohr who holds the title senior intel fellow and helps lead manufacturing technology development said the new production process can squeeze twice the number of transistors into the same space that would allow chip designers to either make their products smaller sharply reducing manufacturing cost or boost the number of transistors per chip designers can use the manufacturing technology to make transistors operate more than faster or to sharply reduce one form of electrical current leakage he said the production process also causes a tenfold reduction in current leakage from another part of a transistor he added intel already has used the technology to make working prototypes of microprocessors that it might begin shipping by the end of the year "when word of that spread through the company you could just feel the excitement level " mr bohr said ibm is announcing plans to introduce similar materials to its nanometer production process which is being developed jointly with engineers from sony corp toshiba corp and advanced micro devices inc ibm expects chips based on the new materials to begin appearing in its computer systems during the first half of "we are coming out with something that is hugely aggressive " said bernie meyerson ibms chief technologist the ibm announcement could be important in the long running competition between intel and amd which fell more than a year behind intel in starting nanometer production amd has vowed to close that gap and the fact it can use the jointly developed technology could help its plans to introduce products using nanometer technology by mid texas instruments meanwhile already has chosen a hafnium based material to add to its nanometer process said a company spokesman it is also committed to adding the metal technology for transistor gates but hasnt settled on the material he said ti plans to offer sample chips on the nanometer process by the end of he said with volume production expected in mid
