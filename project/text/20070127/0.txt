i know who my comrades are out of china this week came two telling news items one is that internet users hit million putting them on track to surpass their u s counterparts in a couple of years the other is president hu jintaos plea that officials further regulate the web and "actively and creatively nurture a healthy online culture " there you have it the chinese cat and mouse game this all raises an old unsettling question of whether the spread of the internet will actually help lead to chinas democratization sure the web has pried open doors to free speech and information on the mainland but if beijing is always just a few paces behind dispatching the censors to slam those doors shut then ultimately does the internet really matter of course it does optimists might argue just imagine what china would look like if its pragmatic development minded leaders had kept the internet out mainlanders would not have been able to sign online petitions read as many outside news reports write blogs and post their comments on "sensitive" topics foreign companies like google yahoo and microsoft may not have descended on the scene more generally think in terms of that milton friedman esque link between economic and political liberty with forces like the internet ushering in development and commercial opportunities can political freedom really be that far behind some of those optimists may have underestimated beijing or at least its willingness to unleash tens of thousands of internet police on top of firewalls and the like to keep the web in check and while the entrance of foreign companies may ultimately play a positive role in increasing access to information more news is good news right in the short term they are paying a price google and microsoft have been widely criticized for censoring themselves in china yahoo for providing authorities with information that helped land a chinese journalist in jail my own optimism has been shaken at times from i wrote a series of journal columns about the chinese internet enthusiastically observing how mainlanders thwarted the censors to spread information and commentary about "forbidden" topics i also saw how quickly words and entire web sites could vanish from sight given these constraints will the internet really be an effective force in bringing freedom of speech and access to information to china the truth is maybe not at least for now the other truth is that these arent necessarily the freedoms in question the internet is setting into motion what could have a far more transformative effect on chinese society freedom of virtual assembly here in america freedom of assembly is easy to take for granted in china where large groups may be met with suspicion or worse it is not in thousands belonging to the religious sect falun gong unexpectedly gathered in beijing for a quiet protest they were neither rowdy nor violent in fact all they really did was assemble yet this inexplicable gathering of chinese from various parts of the country deeply unnerved beijing and was a catalyst for the harsh crackdown on the group this kind of surprise gathering especially from a group that beijing distrusts would still set off alarms today so it is no small event that in cyberspace scores of like minded chinese assemble by the day the internet both in china and elsewhere is a place for individuals to congregate with others that hold similar interests and convictions they exchange ideas information and links to other sites in some cases they even spring for action a chinese online petition in may have helped create the pressure needed to get doctor jiang yanyong released from jail and of course these gatherings yield more dubious outcomes as well just this month a chinese blog reportedly accused a starbucks in the forbidden city of trampling on chinese culture spurring an internet campaign with thousands of supporters and threatening the store with closure more important though is that for those chinese who long harbored suspicions that their views were out of sync with the communist party line the internet created a space to learn that they were not alone or as i remember one intrepid beijing based internet essayist explaining to me now i know who my comrades are in his online world there were vibrant discussions "opinion leaders " and various intellectual camps peering into this universe would even lead one to imagine the root formation of political parties some of these "netizens" have skillfully outwitted the censors by purposely miswriting terms or using proxy servers their words dance above the communist party line alluding to but failing to directly address hot button topics they have created a web in the true sense of the word even if an individual site is taken down another will just spring up in its place yet the fact remains any truly controversial piece of news or opinion would likely be too coded or too quickly deleted to reach the majority of chinese this all brings us back to the original question if words are written but nobody gets to read them will they make a difference beijings censorship of language is a serious obstacle to democratization but it would be a mistake to overemphasize this point in china the internet has already set into motion a core component of democratic consciousness i know who my comrades are those words can easily be deleted the realization behind them can not ms parker is an assistant editorial features editor at the wall street journal see related letter "letters to the editor u s
