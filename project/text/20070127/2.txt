a cop in every living room palo alto calif california assemblywoman sally lieber is going to introduce a bill to make it a misdemeanor to spank children who are four years of age or younger violators will be subject to a year in jail and or a &# fine personally im opposed to spanking my three children were raised and turned out to be good citizens without ever being spanked nor was i spanked when growing up although i received a number of well deserved swats from my mom when i was doing something dangerous but as a year veteran of policing who spent the last years of my career as police chief of kansas city mo and san jose calif i have great misgivings about putting cops in families living rooms to ensure that they are raising their children in accordance with my views or the rules set by the far away state legislature and if we have the police scrutinizing the family how long will it be before the legislature requires the cops to make sure that the children are fed government approved meals playing with "safe " politically correct toys and receiving proper pre school education i recently had the chance to chat with ms lieber on npr about her proposed legislation she is intelligent fluent and has excellent sound bites she defends her bill by saying that we need a law against child beating but california penal code section already prohibits child abuse beating etc and makes it a crime for doctors teachers and others in charge of children not to report suspected abuse to the government child protection agencies the police must also report and like cpas investigate the reports those convicted of child abuse are punished quite severely ms lieber justifies her proposal by saying at the very least it will provoke a "dialogue " it has the telegenic assemblywoman has appeared on national tv and comes across as bright and caring which doesnt harm her political future she deftly substitutes the word "beating" for the vaguer term "spanking " putting her opponents in the uncomfortable position of sounding indifferent to the terrible cases of child abuse that we often see on tv however even in a politically liberal state like california antispanking legislation has produced a backlash against government interference with the traditional right and duty of parents to decide how best to raise their children ms lieber also accurately remarks that decades ago the male dominated police and judiciary ranks needed to be prodded by womens advocates to arrest in domestic violence cases however assault and batteries were already crimes this new bill will create thousands of new crimes in california whose criminal justice agencies are already in a state of crisis police throughout the state are unable to fill their ranks at a time when they are saddled with preventing terrorism eliminating gang violence stopping an upswing in random shootings an increase in homicides preventing drug use putting an end to graffiti controlling traffic devoting an increasing share of resources to investigating complaints against officers and myriad other problems the courts are swamped by the volume of cases the supreme court has declared californias sentencing to be unconstitutional the california prison system has been placed under receivership by federal judges for overcrowding and prisoner abuse increases in californias criminal justice costs have been out of control for decades the states budget deficit which threatens solvency has to a large extent been the result of runaway criminal justice costs this could well worsen the crime picture in the golden state spanking legislation will also have unforeseen consequences as arnold schwarzenegger remarked "how do you enforce that " one cant expect children four and under to call to turn in their parents for spanking just as important is the impact that such legislation will have on families and the children it is intended to protect confused parents may fail to provide necessary discipline for children to keep them from running into traffic playing with matches falling into swimming pools or engaging in other hazardous activities dragging parents into courts putting them in jail or fining them may do far more harm to the child than an occasional swat on the rear end citing a brutal murder case occurring four years ago in which a stepfather repeatedly whipped his child with belts and finally brutally killed the innocent youngster as support for an antispanking law is actually a strong argument against the measure the police and other agencies should be focusing on this type case involving serious felonies instead of wasting scarce resources on investigating nebulous spankings if someday ms lieber and her husband david experience the joy of bringing up children they will also experience the constant concern that parents have for their offsprings safety it is a lot harder to believe that parents are fools or brutal criminals who must be controlled by unrealistic laws when you are a parent exercising your best judgment every day on how to keep your children safe mr mcnamara is a research fellow at the hoover institution at stanford
