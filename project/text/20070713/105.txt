medicine say the wide range of treatments used address broader causes like hormonal imbalances and stress treatment can mean spending time talking to patients about their physical and emotional problems examining their diet and exercise habits and doing blood tests to look for medical or environmental causes for depression such as lyme disease toxic chemicals or mold in los angeles naturopath holly lucille has seen more patients in the past two years whose chief complaint is mental health related while sara thyr a naturopath in manchester and concord n h has seen a rise margot longeneckers naturopathy practice in branford and wallingford conn now has half of its patients come for anxiety and depression compared with three years ago "half the time you feel like you have a psychiatric degree more than a chiropractic degree " says basking ridge n j chiropractor jerry szych whos seen a rise in patients seeking counseling services over the same period columbus ohio chiropractor ronald farabaugh says he has seen an increase of over the past three years in those cases melissa mannon a year old photographer in bedford n h saw psychologists for years about her depression and anxiety then she visited a naturopath for help with infertility and was diagnosed with an intolerance to different foods including gluten she changed her diet and within seven months she got pregnant and most of her anxiety and depression went away she says she still sees her naturopath if shes feeling down and to discuss whats happening in her life "she understands me " says ms mannon some say the extra time and intimacy of the treatments can encourage patients to open up naturopath mark sanders who has seen the number of patients coming for mental health rise threefold to about since he started his practice five years ago says patients tend to open up when he performs craniosacral therapy it is meant to ease stress and improve physical movement "ive had people tell me stuff they dont tell their therapist " he says stanford university medical school clinical professor of medicine kenneth pelletier says chiropractors and naturopaths arent adequately trained to recognize true psychopathology but dr pelletier believes most of these practitioners are ethical about remaining within the scope of their practice and refer patients to licensed mental health care practitioners when they think the diagnoses are severe thats what portland ore naturopath samantha brody has been doing as she increasingly sees patients with eating disorders anxiety and depression while the stigma of seeing a shrink may have declined in cities like new york and los angeles it is alive and well in portland and some patients wont follow up on her referrals still ms brody steers away from serious counseling "i dont dig into childhood stuff " she says cheryl higgins started seeing ms brody three years ago for acupuncture because her back hurt she was also driving her friends crazy by trying to use them as therapists and needed an outlet for her anxiety and depression "i spilled my guts to her at the first session " says the year old office manager her treatment chemical and amino acid supplements plus acupuncture three times a week ms higgins hesitated to follow ms brodys referral to a psychologist but eventually she did see one who recommended that her primary care doctor put her on an antidepressant she went on lexapro for nine months then went back to the naturopath to help her get off of it "it made me yawn all the time " she says while the research is limited some studies have shown promise in using alternative methods to treat mental illness a recent study at boston university school of medicine and mclean hospital in belmont mass showed a neurochemical response to the practice of yoga thats similar to neurochemical responses seen when people are treated with antidepressants even pharmaceutical companies are starting to look at ingredients that have traditionally been part of natural medicine last year novartis bought the u s rights to a drug called agomelatine a melatonin related agonist that is thought to influence mood in part through the sleep wake cycle of course alternative medicine has been used for mental health issues for years a study by ron kessler and david eisenberg at harvard medical school found that among those with anxiety and or depression more than half used alternative medicine therapies among those who sought the treatment of a licensed conventional provider two thirds also used alternative medicine during the prior year the perceived helpfulness of the alternative therapies was similar to the perceived helpfulness of conventional therapies some critics say the growing interest is in a sense a step backwards as people become frustrated with the shortcomings of new treatments they become more inclined to try age old therapies regardless of whether theyve been rigorously tested the treatment of depression is "a constant succession of hyped theories and overall pathetically little progress " says john horgan director of the center for science writings at the stevens institute of technology in hoboken n j now community clinics are using the approach the mental health center of greater manchester n h which combines traditional psychiatry with naturopathic treatments for seriously mentally ill patients received a two year grant last summer from the new york based ittleson foundation to promote the intermingling of naturopathy and psychiatry "its just a better way to approach the problem " says ronald parks an internist and psychiatrist in asheville n c who uses alternative methods and was just approached to create a community based model near his practice aliza sherman risdahl agrees she began experiencing uncontrollable rage irritation and anxiety after the birth of her daughter though the year old anchorage alaska consultant was already seeing a therapist she didnt want to go on antidepressants she turned to a naturopath who diagnosed her with overactive adrenal glands and suggested an amino acid to spray under her tongue now shes no longer throwing dirty plates from the dinner table up in the air screaming at her husband to "give me the baby you cant keep her from me " and running through the house slamming doors and cursing at him "i am so grateful " she says
