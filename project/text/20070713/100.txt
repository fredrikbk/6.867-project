weekend journal taste tis not simple to give gifts the moody graphics and pulsing soundtrack of karma tycoon convey the look of your typical video game absent however are the m s camouflage humvees and vampires that fill the screens of most of its competition karma tycoon is all about another type of thrill seeking youth philanthropy confused karma tycoon is a joint venture between the web based youth volunteerism organization do something and corporate partner jpmorgan chase their goal to teach middle and high school kids about "fiscal responsibility and social entrepreneurship " players are encouraged to support charitable causes such as community centers and senior citizen homes the greater the effect these initiatives have the more a players "karma" increases along the way players learn the mechanics of philanthropy from soliciting grant applications to dolling out loans and reviewing the success of their projects "we want to convert the time kids spend playing video games into time they spend learning how to help their communities through philanthropy " nancy lublin ceo of do something told me "karma tycoon is like a vitamin in a twinkee " the game is part of a recent general effort taking various forms to teach young people about charitable giving its not hard to see why such an effort is needed the nonprofit sector has witnessed phenomenal growth in the past years and it will be looking for even more philanthropy savvy workers and leaders as baby boomers not a few of them embarrassingly prosperous retire and funnel some of their money to charitable causes americans gave a record &# billion to charity last year according to the center on philanthropy at indiana university classes at more than universities expose students to the nonprofit world mostly through managerial training accounting and study of nonprofit policy classes at a smaller number of institutions try to examine philanthropy using a wider lens robert rycroft a professor at mary washington university in fredericksburg va teaches a philanthropy course "from the perspective of economics " but at other colleges he told me "they approach philanthropy from political science commerce sociology leadership studies this is a topic that embraces a lot of different fields " many of the new philanthropy courses are being offered thanks to grants from outside foundations at colgate university in hamilton n y a &# gift from the brennan family foundation established the upstate institute student philanthropy council a year long noncredit course in which students learn to run a nonprofit after studying the history of philanthropy and management strategies students solicit applications from local community groups this year proposals came in which students then judged according to criteria they designed themselves the selection process included on site visits and a formalized review process culminating in awards from the foundation given to four groups "this was our first year and so it was very risky " ellen kraly the program director said "but the students were not bleeding hearts they were serious and tried to stretch their dollars as far as they could " critics say that courses whose budgets come from outside grants or from university funds miss a critical component of any philanthropic enterprise fund raising according to leslie lenkowsky a professor of philanthropic studies at indiana university and the former head of president bushs corporation for national and community service "the best undergraduate courses engage students in raising money not just receiving it the key to a successful program is not simply acquiring managerial skills but a holistic sense of how philanthropy works " but a well rounded education should mean not only learning to bring in and give out money but also studying the philosophical foundations of charity james smith whose work at georgetown university has provided a model for newer courses at colgate and elsewhere said that he draws heavily on aristotle cicero and tocqueville in his courses on philanthropy "my objective is to show theres a long charitable tradition rooted in many traditions throughout history " american humanics a national alliance of colleges and nonprofits offers students a certificate of competency in nonprofit work if they fulfill course requirements in a range of fields including ethics the momentum behind these courses comes from a new generation of civic minded students eager to take volunteerism to the next level according to these professors and other philanthropy experts "volunteering is something your grandma did " mr lenkowsky explained by contrast when young people use language like "philanthropy" and "social entrepreneurship" these days they are trying to give their community outreach a greater sense of scope sophistication and seriousness nancy lublin of the volunteer organization do something notes that philanthropy plays a part in young peoples choice of heroes "kids in middle and high school idolize warren buffett but they have no idea what berkshire hathaway is " she remarked "they think hes cool because he gave away &# billion last year " the shift from the lemonade stand to the philanthropy desk may be emblematic of a generation known for its impatience and sense of entitlement but it also shows the groups admirable desire to address problems outside their local universe on one level todays youth philanthropy movement is intensely pragmatic its about adults equipping students with the tools to run nonprofits and effectively distribute charitable funds but on another level it points to a new sensitivity and shrewdness students have toward giving and its impact on their community as aristotle wrote in the "ethics" "to give away money is an easy matter in any mans power but to decide to whom to give it and how large and when and for what purpose and how is neither in every mans power nor an easy matter " thats where the video games come in mr sahner is a robert l bartley fellow at the journal this summer
