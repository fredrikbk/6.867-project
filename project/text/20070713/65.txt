politics &amp economics divisions harden over iraq bush democrats jockey for position ahead of key september debate washington the white house and congressional democrats stepped up their political battle over the iraq war with each side laying down markers designed to boost their chances of prevailing in a pivotal debate over iraq in september divisions hardened as the house voted to approve legislation that would require a withdrawal of u s troops to begin in the next days president bush promised to veto that or other timetable measures accusing lawmakers of trying to micromanage the war the jockeying came as the administration released a report that concluded the iraqi government had failed to meet the key political and security benchmarks mr bush had initially used to justify the recent "surge" of new u s forces into iraq including a new law governing distribution of iraqs vast oil resources mr bush seemed likely to prevail in the current dispute even though a rising number of republicans are seeking a change in direction in iraq only a handful of republicans broke ranks to vote for the democratic measure in the house and democrats face long odds of getting the vote supermajority needed to pass a similar measure in the senate in the coming days still both sides acknowledged that they were effectively jockeying for position now in advance of what will be a more significant debate over the future of the u s mission in iraq when congress votes on the military budget in september the two top u s officials in iraq gen david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker are set to give a formal report at that time on the progress of the administrations troop surge and lawmakers from both parties see it as a likely turning point in congressional support for the war democrats are working to win over republicans who have signaled that they may abandon their support for the presidents handling of iraq if the surge doesnt show clear progress by the fall senate majority leader harry reid d nev is pressing for withdrawal but if this proposal is blocked as expected in the days ahead he has agreed to allow votes later on a series of less restrictive bipartisan amendments crafted by republicans democrats believe these more moderate alternatives can be stepping stones to bigger changes in september one approach would be to narrow the mission of u s troops to remove units from some combat situations not iraq entirely another alternative endorses the iraq study group recommendations a third sets firm deadlines to develop plans to reduce the u s presence in iraq and devise alternative military postures that could still defend american interests in the mideast the white house meanwhile has been trying to persuade skittish lawmakers to hold off on breaking ranks with the administration until at least september speaking to reporters at the white house mr bush urged lawmakers to give the surge more time to work "i dont think congress ought to be running the war " he said "im certainly interested in their opinion but trying to run a war through resolution is a prescription for failure and we cant afford to fail " but in the house democrats passed a bill requiring a u s withdrawal from iraq and allowing the administration to maintain only a "limited" u s presence there after april the remaining forces could be used to protect u s diplomats train iraqi forces and battle islamic militants but would require the administration to spell out by jan what those missions would be and what personnel would be needed only four republicans joined democrats to support the house bill prompting house minority leader john boehner r ohio to issue a press release declaring "house republicans remained united on the iraq vote " still the new administration report seemed certain to complicate white house efforts to maintain congressional support for its handling of iraq in advance of the coming september debate the report painted a generally bleak picture of a country that remains plagued by sectarian violence and political instability despite the influx of tens of thousands of additional american military personnel in recent months the congressionally mandated report found that the iraqis had made "satisfactory" progress on eight benchmarks "not satisfactory" progress on eight others and "mixed" progress on the remaining two issues the report was more critical than those numbers suggest while it praised the iraqis for sending three brigades of soldiers to baghdad several of the other areas where the iraqis were said to make satisfactory progress concerned relatively unimportant issues such as the rights of minority political parties in iraqs parliament although the report credited iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki with some achievements it concluded that the iraqis had made little progress on the issues president bush laid out as his key goals for the troop increase when the plan was unveiled in january the report said iraqs efforts were "not satisfactory" in terms of passing a new law governing the division of iraqs considerable oil revenue changing its constitution to make it easier for former baath party officials to participate in public life and funding billions of dollars in new reconstruction projects other areas where baghdad had failed to make enough progress according to the report include implementation of legislation clearing the way for new local and provincial elections and mechanisms for ensuring that iraqs security forces dont improperly target the nations sunni minority
