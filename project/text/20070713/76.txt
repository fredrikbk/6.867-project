the mccain feingold effect john mccains campaign fell into disarray this week kicked off by the news it had raised a scant &# million so far mark these money woes down to any number of problems but dont entirely discount the mccain feingold effect lets stipulate that most of the good senators troubles stem from high profile policy disagreements hes had with his own base hes tweaked noses on global warming and slapped faces on immigration his admirable decision to stand strong on iraq has been undermined by his tendency to stand weak on national security issues such as interrogations and enemy combatants and economic conservatives just dont trust a guy who wont admit that cutting taxes is good yet while each of these issues has undoubtedly taken its financial toll mr mccain has labored under yet one more burden mccain feingold he was the prime author of that law which took direct aim at his own party and its activists making it harder for them to collect money register voters and voice opinions about candidates it left the very people so vital to a campaign in its early stages those who write checks knock on doors turn out for primaries furious with him talks with party officials and activists today suggest that hostility remains and has played into his money difficulties "for most conservatives campaign finance is conceptually pretty easy they saw it as targeting them " says bradley smith former chairman of the federal election commission now a professor of law at capital university and chairman of the center for competitive politics "ive been surprised at how angry people were and remain over that law " dont underestimate just how many americans he means huge and influential interest groups such as the national rifle association and the national right to life committee viewed mccain feingold as a direct threat to their missions both were among the first to sue over parts of the law including provisions barring ads to days before primaries and elections both also went out of their way to inform their memberships about mccain feingolds threats to free speech and activists ability to target politicians who support gun laws or abortion for years now the nra has bombarded its four million members with information and attacks on the law via its magazines emails direct mailing telephone calls and its satellite radio program "our members are more politically savvy more in tune and they understand the impact of mccain feingold more than your average interest group member " says andrew arulanandam director of public affairs at the nra which is another way of saying they arent always keen to open their wallets for mr mccain national right to life took campaign finance restrictions so seriously that it included mccain feingold as two of three key votes it used to score senate members in the third was a ban on abortions in military medical facilities it has reminded its many subscribers to its monthly newsletter of the laws problems david keene chairman of the american conservative union acu the nations oldest conservative lobby group goes so far as to say that he always thought "there was a ceiling on mccains support " largely because of mccain feingold that ceiling if it does exist isnt just on financial donors but on those in the party apparatus who might otherwise be out drumming up support the republican national committee membership as recently as this january passed a resolution condemning mccain feingold which could only be seen as a rebuke to one of the partys leading candidates for the presidential nomination "the rnc is interesting it is overwhelmingly negative toward him and that seems to be driven by campaign finance reform " says david norcross new jerseys republican national committeeman similarly talk to republican party officials at the state county and local level and among their biggest gripes is the difficulties they face in recruiting local candidates funding those candidates and registering voters to support those candidates all thanks to mccain feingold some leaders point to the lackluster support mr mccain has received from state delegates as an expression of this bitterness how much has this really made a difference to mr mccains bank account impossible to say maybe lots maybe only a few million dollars mccain campaigners are quick to point out their guy has a better record on gun rights and life questions than do his leading opponents they believe voters care more about that history than they do free speech limitations mccain fundraisers say this isnt an issue they hear about when they are ginning up money mr mccains opponents arent as sanguine former massachusetts gov mitt romney made repeal of mccain feingold a key policy statement way back in march rudy giuliani who once supported mccain feingold recently hailed the supreme court decision overturning part of that law as a "victory for free speech and personal liberty " publicly candidates present these views as a matter of principle but privately some staffers admit it also has to do with collecting money all eyes are meanwhile on fred thompson who was a supporter of campaign finance restrictions in mr keene of the acu says hes already been getting calls from activists asking about mr thompsons record in the senate and that hes been telling them that while the overall picture was good "it would be better if he hadnt been a chief water carrier for mccain feingold " to the extent the former tennessee senator has said anything hes walking back early comments suggest he may argue mccain feingold was an experiment he supported at the time but that simply hasnt panned out he noted in june that the days ad restrictions coincidentally the part of the law that most annoyed grassroots activists werent "working " whatever the effect mr mccain must surely be considering the irony of his current situation mitt romney has also burned through money quickly and in theory should be looking at a low bank balance but mr romney can write himself a check at any time one of the few things mccain feingold allows mr mccain might well have some billionaire supporters whod be only too happy to give him a big financial boost at this crucial time though they wont be allowed to thanks to finance restrictions the senator has family money though its not clear hed tap that to keep his bid running for now hes stuck raising it the hard way under a system that much of the gop hates
