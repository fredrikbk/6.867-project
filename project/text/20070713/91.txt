weekend journal drivers seat a hit makeover and a miss bigger and better thats where most automotive product planning starts and ends these days in a philosophy of escalation that supposedly insures each successive generation of vehicles trumps the last this doctrine goes largely unchallenged by consumers who tend to be more than happy to "trade in and trade up " as the saying goes occasionally however this warm embrace of planned obsolescence gives way to a more chilly reception "you did what to my car " this danger is particularly manifest when a car maker revamps an iconic design or a model that serves as a halo for a brand two such examples one done well and one that begs the question "why " recently crossed my driveway the new audi tt roadster and scion xb the tt was originally introduced for the model year and its brilliant styling immediately legitimized audi as a true sports car competitor once again to porsche and bmw the xb debuted as a and over just three model years this boxy compact wagon has become the quirky face of toyotas nascent youth brand both vehicles have now been thoroughly redesigned as early to market models neither was available as a and both are significantly larger faster and more feature laden than their predecessors and of course they both cost more going in youd think audi would have had a harder time with its chore especially considering how antithetical bigger and better is to the very essence of a sports car for all the potentially misplaced priority given to power and speed in this milieu there is no better display of pure engineering than a sports car whose designers have respected the fundamental rule that less is more yet the new tt roadster succeeds precisely because of its grander proportions stretched over five inches in length and three in width the car is flatter and sleeker and the rampant cuteness of the old tt has been entirely dispatched none too soon i might add as after seven years it was wearing a bit thin this in turn complements a more menacing visage with angled headlights flanking audis signature swallow it whole grille a longer wheelbase and more sophisticated rear suspension have helped improve the cars handling while luggage capacity has increased by making the tt roadster more usable as a primary vehicle but the best part of the cars growth is that by one measurement it has shrunk the horsepower l v powered tt roadster i tested weighs in at pounds including its standard all wheel drive system this is pounds less than the old model with the same engine a feat accomplished mostly by audis liberal use of aluminum in the tts body structure it boasts a tilt towards the lightweight alloy the end result is one that any sports car aficionado should be able to appreciate instrumented testing by road &amp track magazine shows that at seconds the new v powered tt roadster is more than a second faster in a mph sprint than the old model you will pay for that second however as the price has jumped more than &# to &# including destination charge while the relative merits of sports cars are easily calculated with a stopwatch evaluating the changes wrought in the xb is a more complicated and subjective task but consider if you will a few objective measures the little box has gained more than pounds in weight grown a foot in length and now has nearly a liter of additional engine displacement its liter four cylinders horsepower is a whopping more than the old xbs little liter motor could manage yet for all the "improvement" implied by this dramatic expansion in size the new xb has less headroom less front legroom and only more cargo capacity than the old xb the most significant upgrade to the xb and its an important one is that it has standard side impact air bags in the front and side curtain air bags both front and rear toyotas engineers could have figured out a way to add that safety equipment without completely redesigning everything else and they should have but instead theyve created an entirely new vehicle that doesnt do anything better than the old one did except accelerate a strange choice as up to now power and speed have had exactly nothing to do with the xb which looked slow and went slower that was fine because it caught on with hipsters and elders alike due to its low cost functionality and particularly its antistyling speaking of which the new xbs rounded off body lines and more aggressive front fascia are too cool by half the redesigned model has been on the market for just over two months so its too early to say whether people will warm to it indeed scion may sell more of them despite raising the xbs price by to &# someone has to pay for all that extra steel but i cant imagine the new model achieving the same cult following as the original from the engine it now shares with the toyota camry hows that for irony to a sub mile per gallon epa fuel economy rating the xb has become a lot more like everything else on the market and in doing so has lost its soul contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
