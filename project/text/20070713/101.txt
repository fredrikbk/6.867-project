weekend journal tastings a dinner table where wines meet their match to find great pairs develop your taste for the unexpected as soon as we get a chance dottie is going to prepare her famous roast duck and serve it with a riesling spatlese from germany this is quite radical for us we always pair this special dish with fine red burgundy or american pinot noir but when we returned from our annual trip to disney world a few weeks ago along with our suntans and eight pounds of hotel soaps we brought back something unusual a new wine food pairing idea just about every day we receive a letter from someone asking us what wine will go with a certain dish books have been written with extensive lists of "perfect" pairings but there are so many variables in each pairing the sauces the spices and personal taste among them that its impossible to know what will work best whats fun is trying more restaurants are showing the way its hard to believe now that the whole idea of a tasting menu was foreign in the u s not too long ago and the idea of pairing each dish of a tasting menu with a wine was even more obscure just a few years ago when we went into some of americas finest restaurants and asked the sommelier to pair each of our courses with a wine we were often met with quizzical looks now tasting menus with wine pairings are common not just at great restaurants like the french laundry and charlie trotters but even at many less formal local places and while not all of them are successful weve had some pairings that seemed more driven by what bottles happened to be open than by complementary tastes theyre always worth a try to see how the professionals try to make food and wine dance together we have been visiting disney world since and have seen its attention to wine soar that has leveled off in the past few years the wine lists are not nearly as dynamic as they once were and the prices on everyday wines continue to be outrageously high but victoria &amp alberts in the grand floridian resort &amp spa continues to be a great destination for a marriage of wine and food we made reservations six months in advance for the chefs table and by total accident happened to be there on fathers day which was a treat for john our wine pairing dinner there &# per person plus &# per person for the wine pairing is a good demonstration of how the experts try to pair things after we returned home we called the man in charge of victoria &amp alberts israel perez who handles the wine pairing personally to ask him about it "food comes first " said mr perez who has worked in disney world restaurants including the california grill and artist point for years "im not going to dictate to the chef scott hunnel what hes going to make whatever he wants to put on the menu he makes and i try to identify some of the main flavor profiles in the dish to make the pairings a little bit of wine pairing is from experience but sometimes a particular sauce comes into play so i may have to change my own mind " how does this play out heres our dinner and how mr perez chose the wines amuse bouche vegetable ratatouille ravioli hazelnut butternut squash cream lobster en crepe with vanilla aioli with heidsieck &amp co monopole "blue top" champagne from france "i normally like to start with champagne because it has a multitude of things it can go with and its an exciting way to start the meal " mr perez said buffalo tenderloin with braised fennel radishes and satsuma tangerine vinaigrette with twisted oak roussanne marsanne from california "the buffalo course had the smoky buffalo pieces then two sauces one made with tangerines that gave it a citrus influence and then the vinaigrette which added acidity to the dish then chunks of blood oranges my thinking was if im going to pair the buffalo by itself a syrah from the walla walla region of washington would be good but in this dish at the beginning of the meal i didnt want to go really intense so i found this wine from rhone varietals this wine has some citrus tones and a little bit of oakiness that pulls together the smoky flavors of the buffalo verdejo from spain has some of the citrus quality and some of the wines from campania in italy have some citrus qualities so there are different choices that could be made " copper river king salmon with bamboo rice blend and coconut broth with trimbach gewurztraminer from alsace "salmon by itself i might pair with a pinot noir but once you pair it with a sauce with coconut broth with an asian influence i knew it might overpower pinot so i thought with those asian influences a gewurztraminer would be good especially one from alsace because theres a little spice to it that goes along with the asian components of the dish " pondicherry peppered quail with a four grain pancake georgia peaches and corn with dr thanisch graacher himmelreich riesling spatlese from germany "the quail came with a pancake and with peaches that gave a little bit of sweetness to it and pondichery pepper so there was some spiciness i thought i wanted to try a riesling sometimes rieslings have that peachy component it also could have gone with a gewurztraminer which can go a little sweet its always a playful game with the chemistry of the food and the wine pinot noir comes to mind for many different selections if i have duck or even quail pinot comes to mind but i have to get to the sauce " new zealand elk with elephant garlic spaetzle and turnip kraut with navarro correas malbec from argentina "when i thought about elk i thought about malbec right away if you have something a little gamy malbec goes well with that component i wanted to brighten it up a little bit so i put the malbec to go with it then i tried the elk and it wasnt gamy at all it was tender and lovely but the wine still worked " pan roasted foie gras and fuji apple tart with mostarda di cremona with royal tokaji aszu puttonyos from hungary "sauternes is always the first choice with foie gras but the tokaji matches the intensity of the foie gras and the foie gras is made with apple and that requires something intense the tokaji has a nice layer of acidity so it balances it at the end so you have the rich robust sweet wine with a nice layer of acidity that pulled the dish together " japanese wagyu and australian kobe beef tenderloin with oxtail jus with chateau cantemerle from france "the kobe has some fat content so i went with a bordeaux i wanted a wine thats easily recognized by wine connoisseurs this is a fifth growth that goes all the way back to the eleven hundreds the wine is robust and had to be opened a couple of hours to be balanced " cheese with cockburns years old tawny porto "multiple things can go along with cheeses sometimes a nice pinot can go with the cheese some cheeses are nutty and can take sherry since there were three cheeses on the plate i thought a year old tawny would be a good balance with the intensity of the cheeses " so how did it all work beautifully were happy to say the champagne was a perfectly mouth watering beginning and the twisted oak though white was so big that it easily stood up to the buffalo the salmon gewurz pairing really didnt do much for us it was terrific salmon and we always like the trimbach but we didnt think they spoke to each other very intimately the malbec was indeed perfect with the elk and the beef course really did require a bordeaux though if we were home we probably would have broken out something older and even more special with such spectacular meat the clarity and structure of the bordeaux acted much like a delicious cleansing agent after a mouthful of luxuriously fatty beef the foie gras course was interesting as mr perez said foie gras and sauternes is one of those classic wine food pairings but weve never much liked them together the tokaji and foie gras however really was a match made in heaven with the somewhat dark rich earthy tokaji playing perfectly off the sweet earthy richness of the foie gras the best and most surprising pairing of the night was the spatlese with the quail this is the match that had us thinking about dotties duck we would have thought pinot noir would be perfect with the quail but in any case wouldnt have thought about a slightly sweet riesling in fact they seemed to have been made for each other with the sweet earthiness and great acidity of the wine pairing perfectly with the dark earthiness of the dish it really is worth the time and trouble to look for a nearby restaurant that offers wine food pairings some do this every night while some others have special events on a regular basis good wine stores often know about these its not just a delicious way to spend a night but also an opportunity to gather mouth watering wine food pairing ideas to try at home as for us were off to buy a duck you can contact us at wine wsj com
