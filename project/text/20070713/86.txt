were number one alas some good news on the tax cutting front last week lawmakers approved an percentage point reduction in the corporate income tax rate too bad the tax cutters are germans not americans theres a trend here at least developed nations have adopted reaganite corporate income tax rate cuts since the u s is conspicuously not one of them vietnam has recently announced it is cutting its corporate rate to from singapore has approved a corporate tax cut to from to compete with low tax hong kongs rate of and northern ireland is making a bid to slash its corporate tax rate to to keep pace with the same low rate in the prosperous republic of ireland even in france of all places new president nicolas sarkozy has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to from what do politicians in these countries understand that the u s congress doesnt perhaps theyve read "international competitiveness for dummies " in each of the countries that have cut corporate tax rates this year the motivation has been the same to boost the nations attractiveness as a location for international investment germanys overall rate will fall to by from remarkably at the start of this decade germanys corporate tax rate was all of which means that the u s now has the unflattering distinction of having the developed worlds highest corporate tax rate of federal plus a state average of according to the tax foundation while ronald reagan led the "wave of corporate income tax rate reduction" in the s the tax foundation says "the u s is lagging behind this time " foreign leaders are also learning another lesson lower corporate tax rates with fewer loopholes can lead to more not less tax revenue from business the nearby chart shows the laffer curve effect from business taxation tax receipts tend to fall below their optimum potential when corporate tax rates are so high that they lead to the creation of loopholes and the incentive to move income to countries with a lower tax rate ireland is the classic case of a nation on the "correct side" of this curve it has a corporate rate nearly the lowest in the world and yet collects of gdp in corporate revenues well above the international average the u s by contrast with its near rate has been averaging less than of gdp in corporate receipts kevin hassett an economist at the american enterprise institute who has studied the impact of corporate taxes says the u s "appears to be a nation on the wrong side of the laffer curve we could collect more revenues with a lower corporate tax rate " if only the tax writers in washington would heed this advice congress is moving in the reverse direction threatening to raise the tax rate on corporate dividends which is another tax on business income theres also movement in the senate to raise taxes on the foreign source income of u s companies the effect would be to raise the marginal tax rate for companies that base their corporate headquarters abroad but one reason those countries chose to move to the cayman islands and elsewhere is because of the high u s corporate tax rate the laffer curve analysis indicates that these corporate tax increases are likely to raise little if any additional revenue because companies will have a new incentive to move even more of their operations out of the reach of the irs for all the talk of "tax equity " this is also a recipe for further inequality by driving more capital offshore research from mr hassett and others has shown that high corporate tax rates reduce the rate of increase in manufacturing wages see our editorial "the wages of growth " dec for that matter most economists understand that corporations dont ultimately pay any taxes they merely serve as a collection agent passing along the cost of those taxes in some combination of lower returns for shareholders higher prices for customers or lower compensation for employees in other words americas high corporate tax rates are an indirect but still damaging tax on average american workers one immediate policy remedy would be to cut the u s federal corporate tax rate to the industrial nation average of thats probably too sensible for a congress gripped by a desire to soak the rich and punish business but a democrat who picked up the idea could turn the tax tables on republicans in meantime as the u s fails to act the rest of the world is looking more attractive all the time
