naked an independent shop that has worked with the company in the recent past to work on a new function at the company dubbed "communications planning " the task will help j&amp j broaden its marketing for a range of different media channels including the web as well as events and sports marketing this move will likely accelerate j&amp js shift of ad dollars out of traditional media into newer outlets according to people familiar with the matter the new planning task "really fills in a gap of strategic thinking that we werent getting before " says kimberly kadlec j&amp js chief media officer and world wide vice president overall j&amp js decision was welcome news for interpublic which for the past several years has been trying to recover from a spate of financial problems and client losses flowing from a big acquisition spree in the s while the company had enjoyed some account wins in the first half of this year it lately had suffered a streak of bad news losing some big accounts on the creative side of the business including a large piece of general motorss account and some creative duties for some major j&amp j brands "the results of this review demonstrate that our

one of interpublics biggest clients spending an estimated &# billion on media buying globally a year the account generated roughly &# million in revenue for interpublic a year according to people familiar with the matter about of its total revenue it will retain most of that the portion it is losing "represents as little as low to mid single digit millions of dollars in revenue " says john janedis a senior analyst at wachovia in a note to investors it isnt clear how much revenue interpublic will make on the j&amp j account in the future while j&amp j had cited its recent acquisition of pfizer consumer healthcare as the reason for putting its media accounts up for review one of the main reasons was to find cost efficiencies people familiar with the review say indeed during the review j&amp j told competing firms that the winner would have to "guarantee delivery of global media savings through media rate negotiations and leverage amounting to a minimum of of calendar year net media expenditures " according to a copy of j&amp j request for proposal which was viewed by the wall street journal still an interpublic spokesman says the new contract with j&amp j "represents revenue upside and will add to interpublics profitability " even so the significance of the business is greater than the revenue it directly generates losing big accounts can diminish a media buyers leverage in negotiating ad prices from television newspaper and magazine outlets as a result loss of j&amp js entire account would likely have led to more account departures say people familiar with interpublic "if you lose buying clout perception is you cant carry a big stick and get better prices " says russel wohlwerth a new business consultant at ark aai interpublic lost several big media accounts in including general motors mr roth has been working overtime trying to resuscitate interpublics big media buying operations seen as critical to the companys long term prospects until now he had limited success universal mccann had missed out on several new account pitches this year including office supply retailer staples observers say interpublics need to protect existing accounts made it harder for the company to focus on growth "they cant get in front of themselves and bring in new business if they are always dealing with crises " says mr wohlwerth
