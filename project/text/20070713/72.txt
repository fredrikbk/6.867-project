sick propaganda in michael moores "sicko " pharmaceutical companies are again demonized on the big screen its hardly the first time in "the constant gardener " a pharmaceutical company that also does pesticides makes an antibiotic that is highly effective against multidrug resistant tuberculosis when the antibiotic is found to have a fatal side effect the company buries victims in a mass grave outside of town and kills others who know of the problem in "the fugitive " a pharmaceutical company hires a one armed man to kill richard kimble when he finds out that its drug nearing fda approval causes fatal liver damage neither the screenwriters nor the public considered these two scenarios to be implausible in "sicko " mr moore shows how citizens in cuba pay pennies for medicines that cost hundreds of dollars in the united states and how companies make drugs like ambien to "dope up" citizens who now realize that the american dream is only a myth he shows buildings bearing the logos of pfizer merck and eli lilly faceless monolithic and impenetrable mr moore never interviews anyone from these companies "they already have their story out there " he has said "its called the nightly news " mr moores choice not to talk to anyone from pharmaceutical companies was a loss for his viewers during the past century the lifespan of americans increased by years and almost all of that increase was due to one class of medical products vaccines children today receive different vaccines by the time they are two years old although most people dont know it nine of those vaccines which save about eight million lives a year were made by one man and that man maurice hilleman spent much of his career at merck if he hadnt if hed stayed in academia he would never have been able to convert his dedication and brilliance into the products that save our lives when mr moore talked about better health it would have been nice to have seen hillemans image on the screen there is another image that mr moore could have included in a vaccine to prevent rotavirus was licensed by the food and drug administration rotavirus a disease of young children that causes vomiting high fever diarrhea and dehydration kills children in the developing world every day and causes a great deal of suffering in the developed world penny heaton of merck was the pharmaceutical company executive who headed the program at the end of a pre licensure study that took four years to complete included children and cost about &# million dr heaton called together people at her company as a co inventor of the vaccine i was present at this meeting she started with a series of slides "this is what the world looks like now " she said pointing to a map that contained hundreds of small black dots concentrated in asia africa and latin america "each of these dots represents deaths a year from rotavirus " then dr heaton showed a map without any black dots "now " she said pointing to the clean map "we have the technology in hand to eliminate deaths from this disease " then she wept she stood in front of people with her head down and her shoulders shaking this isnt an image that anyone has of a pharmaceutical executive the rotavirus vaccine is now available in mali ghana vietnam bangladesh and nicaragua mr moore could have framed the real problems with pharmaceutical companies by asking the right questions how can we eliminate marketing practices that unduly influence clinicians by providing unethical incentives does direct to consumer advertising mislead the public by creating the notion of magic medicines without side effects do we benefit from companies developing yet another hair loss or potency product while diseases with a much smaller market go ignored can the federal government become the sole purchaser of drugs without eliminating the profit that drives companies to make them and does society benefit from the tax that is included in the price of every drug because of massive litigation but mr moore yielded to the zeitgeist vilifying companies and their lobbyists in an easy populist act that failed to educate his viewers dr offit is chief of infectious diseases at the childrens hospital of philadelphia co inventor of a rotavirus vaccine and the author of the just published "vaccinated one mans quest to defeat the worlds deadliest diseases" smithsonian books
