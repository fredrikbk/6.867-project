on st croix senators feel heat over a pay increase mainlanders radio show stirs up political scene now critic is fcc focus st croix u s virgin islands roger w morgan is short a little pudgy and on a recent morning his workday uniform consisted of shorts sandals and a flower print shirt he doesnt look like a revolutionary but a group of virgin islands senators say hes that kind of threat a few months ago the year old mr morgan and listeners to his radio call in show "free speech " led an unsuccessful effort to recall four st croix senators after the senate voted itself a pay increase since then one senator has accused mr morgan of leading an attempt to overthrow the virgin islands government another suggested mr morgan is a member of the ku klux klan now the senators are asking the federal communications commission to block mr morgans proposed purchase of wyac fm the station that broadcasts his show mr morgan thinks the senators are using the fcc to punish him for letting citizens complain about civic matters a right mr morgan says is in short supply on this tiny caribbean island sen ronald e russell says thats not so he thinks mr morgan is irresponsible and lets callers run an unchecked smear campaign "he allows people to destroy and injure persons in the communitys reputation without any type of restrictions " says sen russell the fight between mr morgan and the senators has touched on lots of lofty issues like free speech political accountability and race relations on an island where most people are black and many newcomers including mr morgan are white and wealthy by comparison but the friction also illustrates what can happen when americans from the mainland known as "continentals" to the local crucians bring a more abrasive brand of political criticism to a place where politicians have a cozier relationship with their electorate the u s virgin islands which include st thomas st croix and st john are an unincorporated territory of about people st croix the largest of the three has about people its about miles long and miles wide senators here are everyday citizens as likely to be seen at the supermarket as on tv most everyone seems to know one of them there are senators in the virgin islands legislature which meets in st thomas seven from st croix so while crucians have plenty of criticisms about local politics they didnt customarily call senators "thieves" on the radio as they did during the recall attempt mr morgans show changed that from to noon each weekday morning callers to "free speech" gripe about everything from driving on the left side of the road to chatty bank tellers local politics and the characters in office are a frequent topic but because mr morgan and many of his callers are mainlanders identified by their lack of an island accent the nagging tone of "free speech" offends some listeners "people get on the radio and they want us to do everything they do in california and oklahoma and texas " says roy rodgers who owns a tug and barge company "weve got some problems like everybody got problems they compare our bad to their good they never compare our good to their bad " amid the controversy mr morgans station is prospering in may readers of the virgin islands daily news named wyac fm "best radio station" and mr morgan "best radio personality " on a recent afternoon mr morgan took his staff out for margaritas to celebrate the stations rising advertising revenue mr morgan born jerry lambert has always been an entertainer as a child he performed a roping routine while traveling the u s with his dad a rodeo announcer mr morgan got his first radio gig in junior high school and says he changed his name to get out from under his fathers shadow he has been on the radio and going by the name roger w morgan ever since for most of mr morgans year broadcasting career his shows have been about comedy and music listeners in omaha neb knew roger w morgan as the guy who makes prank calls ending each call by telling hapless answerers that theyd been "morganized " he hosted rock shows in san diego and san francisco and had a syndicated oldies show in omaha mr morgan discovered st croix on a family trip and liked it so much they decided to move there at first he continued airing rock on another station he began doing "free speech" in like any call in show "free speech" lives on the passions of its callers and mr morgan does his best to rile them up when the calls arent coming hell pose a question to listeners one morning recently he asked callers what makes a person a "true" virgin islander one caller suggested at least years of residency no issue has brought in more calls than act the law which was passed in a special session on dec raised the governors salary to &# from &# and the senators salaries to &# a year from &# the average income on st croix is &# according to a university of the virgin islands survey callers denounced the raises as excessive and the timing shady because the issue was raised at the end of the legislative session jim hoffman publisher of a monthly newspaper suggested a recall drive within two weeks about people had signed a petition to recall five virgin islands senators including three st croix senators who had voted for the raises and a fourth who didnt show up for the vote a little more than a week later sen russell and other senators targeted in the recall sent a letter to the fcc on senate stationery asking the commission to deny the transfer of wyac fm from its current owners to mr morgan "it appears that mr morgan is using the issue of a senatorial recall to destabilize the legislative branch of government " the letter says the fcc says it is reviewing the objection and declined further comment during the months long campaign senators were blasted on bumper stickers and labeled "caribbean pirates" on t shirts listeners called out sen juan figueroa serville a target of the recall for hiring his father as chief of staff the practice of hiring relatives is fairly common among st croix politicians sen figueroa serville swung back in march when he delivered a five minute statement in which he made multiple references to "roger w morgan and his ku klux klan cronies and puppets " he also framed his newly raised salary in racial terms "to them black people should not make money " while the war of words has gotten nasty mr morgan says hes more concerned about his legal expenses &# and counting sen russell who is a lawyer wont say how much he has spent for legal expenses but says hes using his own money the claims of racism have rung hollow to residents on the island around st croix its tough to find anyone white or black newcomer or native who wasnt opposed to the senators raises "it was ridiculous " says frances molloy who has lived on st croix since and owns a clothing store here about the racial charges "we dont have that kind of tension here so we dont need anyone to start it " whats going to happen when the spat is over actually sen russell thinks he and mr morgan will make up "its nothing personal " he says
