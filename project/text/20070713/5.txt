beijing olympics china newly fastidious spiffs up public restrooms beijing with the beijing olympic games a year away china is fast approaching a watershed more than two million visitors are expected to attend the event which chinas leaders have long envisioned as a showcase not just of its athletic prowess but also its cultural and economic advances thats why beijing is spending at least &# million to sanitize its image as a nation of dirty toilets the strategies range from high tech such as buying the latest in water saving devices for its public toilets to low tech such as hiring armies of inspectors and cleaners who live and sleep on the premises in addition to running test trials of some olympic events this summer authorities will also be testing the public facilities with stepped up checks and fines the upgrade is vital alongside its image as an emerging power china is struggling to overcome a global reputation as a purveyor of disease and poor quality or tainted products officials are determined to put such associations to rest when china displays a modernized beijing to millions of olympic viewers "i am totally convinced we will have a civilized olympics " beijing communist party chief liu qi told reporters during a recent discussion of campaigns to root out behavior such as spitting and cutting in line from roman to ottoman history has judged civilizations great by the quality of their arts their technology and their plumbing a key denominator of public health standards the romans get high marks their bathhouses had public latrines complete with marble seats over a channel of continuously running water chinese archaeological discoveries include a year old toilet with running water from a pipe in the ground but in recent times chinas plumbing has fallen behind jack sim head of the singapore based world toilet organization says public toilet conditions have an impact on tourism disease morbidity rates and productivity "ultimately toilets are a competitive edge of a nation " raising chinas commodes to first world status is a herculean task given the nations rapid progression from poverty just years ago many urban chinese were using chamberpots even now many residents of beijings old houses in historic hutong alleys depend on public toilets often public toilets dont have toilet paper soap to wash hands or paper towels still an expensive rarity in many homes many chinese toddlers still dont use diapers but are instead dressed in pants slashed open at the crotch a custom that encourages early potty training but also public urination meanwhile theres a simmering culture clash over which kind of toilet is best the porcelain throne is slowly unseating the squat toilet in private homes but is still relatively rare in chinas public facilities only about of beijing public toilets are seated toilets which is a chief complaint of many western visitors who complain that squat toilets are difficult to negotiate and often unclean yet many chinese consider squat toilets to be more hygienic since theres no skin contact imposing seated toilets isnt necessarily the solution some who prefer squat toilets simply perch on them leaving footmarks on the seat that said china has made great strides in its public toilets "if you go back five and years it was pretty horrific but the china today is a vastly different place " says richard ward asia pacific president for american standard companies inc the worlds largest seller of bathroom products with &# billion in annual sales revenue "the olympics " he says "will have the best toilets ever " mr ward says the stadiums that american standard supplies will have a mixture of squat and sit toilets "with a slight bias to squat " the company will supply the toilets for the national aquatic stadium or watercube as well as the national indoor stadium these toilets will flush using gallons of water instead of the standard gallons saving the equivalent of about four cans of soda per flush "while still doing an efficient job " mr ward says that could mean a lot in water starved beijing according to american standards estimates if all beijing households moved to this new technology the city could annually save enough water to fill olympic size pools american standards push is part of a massive attempt to modernize chinas plumbing the country now represents asias second largest market for bathroom ware after japan and is the fastest growing with to sales growth per year according to industry estimates sales of toilet paper are expected to grow to &# billion from to according to euromonitor though most of the olympics games are in beijing the plumbing renovation is happening in many places across china city officials in chongqing just opened a four story public porcelain palace complete with soothing music and more than toilets and urinals spread out over feet there are signs of rapid progress twenty years ago foreigners touring china toted umbrellas to public toilets to use as makeshift doors now private stalls grab bars for the handicapped diaper change tables are no longer rarities but chinas sheer numbers make it hard to keep its facilities clean beijing alone boasts odd public toilets the public one at tiananmen square located just east of mao zedongs portrait can see as many as visitors a day during peak holiday periods fifteen full time cleaners live on the premises to service the more than toilets for men and women including eight seated ones tiananmen square is in beijings dongcheng district which has more than doubled its public toilet cleaners to in two years now the ratio of cleaners to toilets is about to instead of to says dong xiaofeng dongchengs vice president of sanitation the district has also bought a fleet of brand new electric bicycles to speedily transport inspectors to trouble spots an electric bike could be a boon for inspectors like zhao maolin who daily travels a route of about miles on his battered green bicycle to check the work of the cleaners he oversees the rail thin mr zhao formerly worked in an electronics factory but switched jobs two years ago hoping for a less stressful position he said but since beijing authorities installed a toilet hotline for people to complain about unclean facilities or offer suggestions his aggravation has increased he says "why do you think i carry this with me all the time " he said one recent day waving a cellphone "every time it rings i have stress " chain smoking morosely he eyed toilet cleaner zhou qhuanhou as the worker swirled a grayish mop around mr zhou is pretty much on call hours as he lives in a small room wedged between the mens and womens restroom in a public facility about a mile from tiananmen square the room which he keeps comfortably furnished with a bunk bed sink and wooden larder is one of the perks of the job for some of beijings toilet cleaners mr zhou is paid &# monthly he said but rent is free as are electricity and water it all adds up aided by rent free housing on toilet premises husband and wife toilet cleaners chen kebao and li xiaoyun are even putting their daughter through graduate school sue feng contributed to this article
