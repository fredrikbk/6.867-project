can potter readers dodge the plot spoilers whether on the web a tv screen or the corner newsstand its a headline that could ruin a book lovers day "harry dies " or for that matter "harry lives " when the final installment of j k rowlings seven book harry potter saga is published july loyal fans who dont like their surprises spoiled may have only two choices speed reading or quarantine "this is the first thing everybody is going to want to know and i really hope that it wont be screamed from a tabloid " says melissa anelli owner of the leaky cauldron the leaky cauldron org a popular harry potter web site "if you care youll buy the book if you havent finished reading it by the time you see that headline youll be really mad " theres nothing new about trying to dodge information in the age of time shifting and the internet many sports fans with tivos observe personal "news blackouts" so they wont find out the score of a game until they watch it later they avoid tv radio and newspapers they open conversations with "dont tell me " in public they stand ready to put their fingers in their ears and sing to themselves if a conversation starts heading that way and such techniques can be effective at least for a short time this is different "harry potter and the deathly hallows" is a page book twelve million copies have been printed and they will go on sale a week from tonight at exactly a m in each u s time zone three hours later in los angeles than in new york the book will also go on sale at a m in the u k which is p m on americas east coast spoilers could theoretically post the ending on the internet before readers in the u s have even queued up at their local bookstore scholastic corp which holds the u s rights says it isnt worried "based on the people that ive talked to fans wont look " says kyle good a spokeswoman for scholastic "people want to read it on their own its about finding out how she wraps up all the questions that weve all been talking about " some media outlets will be discreet the leaky cauldron web site plans to host a live discussion page but it will be clearly marked "people are going to want to discuss whether they liked it whether it has a good ending if they are satisfied but there will be warnings galore so that we dont ruin it for anyone " says ms anelli she says she figures a month may be the right amount of time to wait before publicly discussing the ending "most of our audience will have read the book by then " she says at the associated press spokesman paul colford says "the ap will not be a spoiler " he says an ap reviewer did disclose that a major character died in book six "harry potter and the half blood prince " but notes that the news service didnt identify the character as hogwarts headmaster albus dumbledore until this month if the ending of "deathly hallows" is widely reported he says the ap will report on the development but he says the story will be written in such a way that the secret wont be revealed the major networks have traditionally been loath to give away the endings of the books and movies they feature on morning talk shows "we would never want to ruin the ending of a book that we know millions of americans are looking to read " says jeffrey schneider a senior vice president of abc news "that said if the ending of the book becomes a major story then we will obviously cover that but we wont set out to intentionally ruin the ending " megan kopf a spokeswoman for "today " says the show might "report that the ending is out there but we wouldnt reveal the ending on our air " whether harry lives or dies isnt the only issue that will need tying up in the seventh book a close second is the question of whether severus snape who killed dumbledore in "half blood prince" two years ago is really bad and because ms rowling has shown a willingness to kill off popular characters what awaits harrys closest friends hermione and ron or of course the evil lord voldemort a hacker has already claimed to have broken into a computer owned by bloomsbury publishing plc the british publisher of the potter series that person identified two leading characters who he said die in "deathly hallows" ms rowling has said at least two will die bloomsbury declined to comment at the time scholastic urged readers to be skeptical of any such claims the author herself on the web site jkrowling com signaled her disgust with anyone who would spoil the ending "i want the readers who have in many instances grown up with harry to embark on the last adventure they will share with him without knowing where they are going " she wrote "there will always be sad individuals who get their kicks from ruining other peoples fun " "other than building a bomb shelter or camping out invariably you run the risk of hearing about it " notes emerson spartz the founder of mugglenet com another popular potter web site he says he plans to read the book as quickly as possible perhaps in a single sitting although it may not be as pleasant as curling up in a hammock over a few summer afternoons readers in a hurry may be able to skim the book in as little as an hour and read it in five or six says richard feldman who owns learning techniques a speed reading company in merrick n y some fans have other strategies sarah raymond a senior at yale says she reread all six published harry potter novels in june to prepare for "deathly hallows " she has ordered the book from amazon com and expects to start reading as soon as it arrives "ill be devastated if i hear the ending before i finish " she says others may also be refreshing their memories in advance of the last installment earlier this week on its opening day the film version of the fifth book "harry potter and the order of the phoenix " from time warner inc s warner bros unit took in &# million that was the biggest single day gross ever for a movie on a wednesday topping "spider man " in according to box office tracker media by numbers from a business point of view retailers dont expect premature disclosure of the ending to hurt sales they believe fans will want to read the novel whether they know the ending or not "its not just about harry " says ann binkley a spokeswoman for borders group inc "i want to know is snape a friend or foe its about getting to the end not the ending itself " kathy setzer an ibm software designer who lives in austin texas says she would like both lord voldemort and harry to die in battle "that would be true to the series " she insists "the prevailing theme is one of sacrifice everyone harry has loved has died including dumbledore and the ultimate sacrifice would be sacrificing harry to kill lord voldemort " but ms setzer says what she really hopes is that shell be able to find out what happens to harry and voldemort on her own when she gets to the end of the book
