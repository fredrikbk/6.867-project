wrong prescription perhaps overstating his case pennsylvania governor ed rendell claimed that jesus moses and muhammad would back his plan for universal health care unfortunately he couldnt get the mortals in the state legislature to go along that confrontation plus a few others led to a budget standoff in harrisburg which ended earlier this week with a compromise though not without the political flourish of a government shutdown mr rendell wanted to muscle through as much new spending as possible but his most controversial proposals were kicked down to a legislative session sometime in the fall on health care this isnt a defeat so much as a deferral the governor got a few consolation prizes and now says hes focusing on an "incremental" approach democrats nationwide seem to be opting for the same strategy which hopes to avoid major political blowups while still achieving a systematic liberal overhaul piece by piece in january mr rendell unveiled an omnibus health care package called "prescription for pennsylvania" that he hoped to have in place by it aims to trim overall health expenditures as well as provide coverage to the or so who are uninsured mr rendell suggested a restrictive "pay or play" scheme in which businesses that didnt or couldnt afford to provide health insurance to their employees would get dinged with a payroll tax these revenues would be rolled into a state administered program for the uninsured to acquire the "universal" label mr rendell employed the by now familiar pincer movement of expanding enrollment in medicaid and schip pennsylvania recently received a go ahead from the federal administrators of the state childrens health insurance program schip for mr rendells "cover all kids" initiative which makes every child eligible for insurance subsidies regardless of family income schip was designed to target the working poor but has since ballooned to cover even affluent adults and democrats in washington are proposing another major expansion for programs like pennsylvanias but state republicans werent asleep at the switch first they held widely publicized hearings on the plans structural problems and punitive economic consequences to wit since about seven of uninsured pennsylvanians are employed the payroll tax would shift most of the costs of a universal program onto business and more than of the uninsured are self employed or work for small businesses so the potential &# billion per year that the plan would cost them drained away much of its democratic support republicans also pointed out that mr rendells plan did nothing to address such cost increasers as medical liability or mandated insurance benefits it would probably make the problem worse with regulations like guaranteed issue so wait until youre sick to buy insurance and premium price controls republicans offered an alternative consumer driven plan focusing on health savings accounts and a health care tax credit so the choice wasnt only mr rendell or the status quo now the governors plan is being sliced into at least separate pieces of legislation mr rendell says he can cut &# billion out of health spending first but this is likely fictional because the calculations are based on charge data not actual costs "if were ever going to have accessible health insurance for all americans " mr rendell recently noted "we have to begin containing costs if costs continue to spiral out of control there is no way the government can afford to pay for it " a purer expression of the liberal health care mentality would be hard to find mr rendell was re elected in with of the vote so the blockade of his plan is no small achievement beltway republicans ought to take note as the health care debate gears up as for the democrats a better way to attain "universal" coverage would be to stop meddling in the insurance market and thus making it more expensive for everyone
