politics &amp economics behind mccain advisers fall close aides departure points to broader woes for senators campaign washington for years john weaver has worked for one thing to make john mccain president as difficult as it was for the chief strategist to be a casualty of the senators shake up of his faltering campaign mr weaver felt worse for his year old daughter jordan for her like him the mccains had been family "i didnt get home in time to tell her before she saw the news on tv and she was crying " mr weaver a single father recalls of tuesdays events his association with the republican senator "was all shes known since she was a baby shes heartbroken but kids are resilient more than we are " the turmoil in the mccain campaign continued yesterday in iowa which holds the first presidential nominating contest top aides ed failor jr and karen slifka said they were quitting in solidarity with those whose resignations were accepted tuesday particularly former campaign manager terry nelson tomorrow the press communications team is planning to resign people familiar with the matter say also this weekend mr mccains second quarter financial report is expected to show a debt of about &# million including &# that mr nelson had withheld from a web company in which longtime mccain adviser lobbyist and campaign chief executive rick davis has a financial interest messrs nelson and weaver among others felt the contract smacked of inappropriate self dealing mr davis couldnt be reached to comment sen mccain has made mr davis his new campaign manager his initial proposal to promote mr davis monday led mr nelson and then mr weaver to resign tuesday followed by several others now the longstanding tensions between the two camps are erupting just as onetime front runner mr mccain is fighting to survive of all the departures none has the poignancy of mr weavers the year old texan belongs to a small distinctly american political class that includes george w bushs karl rove and bill clintons james carville advisers who hitch themselves to a politicians star and rise or fall with it he is widely viewed in political circles as the year old senators more emotional and self effacing alter ego his fall republicans say is a measure of the trouble mr mccain now finds himself in more broadly mr weavers rocky history with the republican party in recent years he went from republican to independent to democrat and back reflects mr mccains own continuing struggle among conservatives suspicious of his independent streak mr mccain accepted mr weavers and mr nelsons resignations a week after the two men had laid off staffers to hold down spending "i cried " mr weaver recalls of the dismissals but his boss remained furious over the campaigns heavy spending and anemic fund raising it has been hurt by mr mccains support for the war in iraq which is unpopular with independents and immigration reform which is unpopular with republicans monday he signaled he had effectively lost confidence in the two men and tuesday he accepted their resignations even so mr mccain told one associate that letting mr weaver go "was one of the toughest things ive ever done " the two have been through a lot together the high point was mr mccains near upset of president bush in the republican primaries the lows included the senators ultimate loss and both his and mr weavers subsequent life threatening illnesses while mr weaver endured two "blur" years of chemotherapy for leukemia from to he also went through a divorce and custody fight and was nearly broke he says mr mccain recovered from his own malignant facial melanoma checked on mr weavers medical care and flew him and daughter jordan to the mccain ranch in arizona for a respite for years after neither man expected mr mccain would have another shot at the partys nomination that was clear from mr weavers political wanderings the senator had emerged from his loss as the nations most popular politician admired especially among independents as a straight talking reformer who bridged the polarized parties but while the avowed ronald reagan theodore roosevelt republican only toyed with becoming an independent mr weaver made the switch embittered by what he saw as the shabby treatment of mr mccain by the pro bush republican establishment mr weaver became an independent in and then a democrat he advised congressional democrats and the trial lawyers lobby mr mccain said mr weaver had no choice having been effectively blackballed from republican work by the bush white house something that mr rove mr bushs political adviser and mr weavers ally turned rival in texas republican politics denies mr weaver was raised in tiny kermit texas when texas was said to have two parties liberal and conservative democrats both parents died when he was a teen mr weavers bigger influence he says was his maternal grandparents grandfather l j "ham" hamilton an indiana native was a rare republican in texas who shared magazines from the conservative national review to the leftist mother jones from grandmother mabel half native american mr weaver says he got his well known temper when enraged he says she would throw dishes at her husband who would "smile and walk off " years later mccain staffers would refer to "wow moments" for wrath of weaver ronald reagans election spurred texas shift to republicanism one of mr weavers first jobs was as an aide in the successful senate race of democrat turned republican phil gramm he and mr rove emerged as top party operatives in texas working and socializing together but they increasingly clashed and ultimately broke it was on sen gramms presidential campaign that mr weaver got to know mr mccain the following year he was part of a kitchen cabinet weighing mr mccains white house run mr rove was doing the same for then gov george bush their showdown came in early mr mccains point victory in the first primary in new hampshire was followed by mr bushs south carolina comeback the enmity lingers especially for mr weaver mccain supporters didnt buy the bush camps denials of complicity with a south carolina whisper campaign suggesting that mr mccain was treasonous as a vietnamese prisoner of war and had a child by a black prostitute as approached every major democrat considering a presidential bid contacted mr weaver about a top job after massachusetts sen john kerry had effectively won the nomination campaign manager mary beth cahill one day came to his home and found him with mr weaver the two were discussing a kerry mccain "unity ticket " kerry aides say mr weaver initiated the idea the aides say he says mr kerry did by all accounts mr kerry became obsessed with the prospect but his staff was opposed and so was mr mccain yet mr mccain "always left the door open a little " a kerry strategist says by august mr mccain was campaigning for mr bush their rapprochement was the result of their strategists own mr weaver knew detente was in his bosss interest just as mr bush needed mr mccains pull with independents in the election ahead mr mccain needed to persuade republicans of his loyalty given mr mccains age and many conservatives undying opposition some confidants thought he shouldnt run and he demurred but last year as mr mccain was in demand among republican candidates for campaign appearances and led in polls he authorized mr weaver to start building a campaign now for mr weaver at least its over "it all happened so fast " he says "it was like a car wreck "
