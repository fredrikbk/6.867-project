beauty fix behind loreals makeover in mumbai in india most beauty products sell for less than a dollar loreal sa is betting its future there on products costing three to times as much the french cosmetics giant has embarked on a strategy that sharply differs from that of its rivals having failed to turn a profit selling low priced shampoo in india it now hopes to capture the growing ranks of middle class indian women by luring them upscale in shops across the country loreals offerings include a &# garnier nutrisse hair dye a &# loreal paris face powder and a &# vichy sunscreen jaya sethi says shes willing to splurge the office assistant in new delhi recently bought two bottles of the garnier hair dye ms sethi used to buy cheaper dyes made of henna plant extract but says the foreign brand is "good quality" and "fun " racing to expand in a competitive global marketplace loreal is tapping into a powerful demographic force indias emerging middle class estimated at million people according to tata consultancy services in mumbai over the past decade foreign brands from tommy hilfiger jeans to absolut vodka have moved in to capture a slice of the market at the heart of the transformation in consumer spending is a cultural shift among indian women decades of poverty instilled a strong sense of price consciousness in women which was passed on from mothers to daughters but the generation that came of age during the market liberalization of the early s is more willing to splurge on luxuries from bottled water to lipstick and eating out consumer analysts say "for these people consumption is a way of life " says neelesh hundekari principal at at kearney inc a management consulting firm in mumbai working women in india spend more on cosmetics such as anti wrinkle cream and sunscreen than women who dont work according to a survey by roopa purushothaman chief strategist for the future group which owns indias largest retailer pantaloon retail india ltd thanks to a recent rise in foreign style salons and international shampoos and dyes hair care sales are expected to jump to &# billion in from &# million last year according to euromonitor a strong tradition of beauty already exists in india historically women emphasized the two most valued parts of the body for beauty with kohl made from soot around the eyes and mehendi or hand painting but loreal and other cosmetics companies such as hindustan and revlon are peddling more modern practices such as lip gloss and foundation loreals strategy stands out as particularly aggressive compared with its competitors most western cosmetics companies stock grocery stores in india with low priced basic shampoo and cold creams that compete with an array of local brands for example market leader hindustan unilever ltd the indian subsidiary of the anglo dutch consumer goods giant sells cent bottles of body lotion and cent shampoo its target audience includes the more than million people in india who live on less than &# a day in contrast one of loreals biggest sellers in india is its excellence creme hair color priced at &# a bottle teeing off its success at the high end of the market loreal recently accelerated its rollout of mass market products too including a &# hair dye and small packets of shampoo costing less than &# but many loreal products are still relatively pricey by indian standards "we dont do poor products for poor people " says alain evrard managing director for loreals africa orient and pacific zone loreals sales are still a fraction of hindustan unilevers whose personal products unit rung up &# million in sales last year from items including deodorants and toothpaste that loreal doesnt sell hindustan unilever declined to comment but loreal is growing in the company became profitable in india after years of losing money sales which have doubled every two years since jumped last year to &# million and are expected to hit &# million this year the companys target which it says comprises the million urban middle class men and women who make more than &# a month is on the rise and should increase to million in two years according to loreals own data yesterday loreal said first half group sales rose to &lt euro&gt billion or &# billion propelled in part by strong growth in emerging markets when it first entered india in loreals strategy was markedly different than it is today following the lead of hindustan unilever it launched with a product designed to appeal to the largest number of consumers possible a shampoo called garnier ultra doux executives at loreal say they thought that the combination of low price and natural ingredients would be a good match for the indian market where women use plants and herbs as part of their daily beauty routines to drive the price down even further than in europe loreal simplified the shampoos formula by eliminating some polymers the molecular compounds that make hair stronger or shinier but ultra doux was a failure from the start the shampoo offered no particular innovation compared with rival products from hindustan and cavin kare a local company loreal struggled to persuade owners of local shops to stock it it was an "absolute flop " says mr evrard who assumed oversight for loreal india several years later in before that the company was part owned by a local distributor mj group in accordance with laws in place at the time which forbade foreign companies from owning a majority stake in their indian operations mr evrard a longtime loreal executive who has worked for the company in latin america and denmark decided to change tack hindustan had the mass market stitched up mr evrard recalls thinking so the only way for loreal to survive was to position itself as upmarket by the mid s consumer attitudes in india were beginning to shift italian fashion brand benetton for example was expanding in india selling its colorful sweaters and denim to women who had previously worn only saris german luxury car maker mercedes had entered india in and already some mercedes sedans were cruising the pot holed streets of new delhi and mumbai a spike in households with cable television brought channels such as mtv and cnn into indian living rooms household appliance makers advertised washing machines and dishwashers on the new channels the number of working women had soared between and million women entered the indian work force according to the international labour organization for a total of more than million women employed as of this year the figure is million according to the ilo though millions more women also work in the informal economy especially in rural areas mr evrard says his first step was to understand what products would best resonate with middle class working women he spent months speaking with advertising executives and editors of fashion magazines including elle which had launched in india in he quizzed loreals local employees on their families consumer habits focusing on hair care he says the breakthrough came when some of these employees complained that they and their peers were getting gray hairs and they were still only in their twenties at the time western style do it yourself hair coloring kits barely existed in india women used henna and other ammonia based liquids and powders to cover their gray but these women said ammonia dried out their hair while henna faded quickly moreover hair dye was one of the few items hindustan did not make so in late mr evrard introduced loreal excellence creme into india excellence creme was one of the french companys most innovative and pricey mass market products in europe in cream form dye is considered more gentle on hair than liquid products in india it cost &# at the time or about the same as in france loreal set out to market it as a luxury purchase the company signed on diana hayden winner of the miss world contest in as loreals first indian advertising face "for me beauty starts with beautiful hair " ms hayden cooed in one television commercial two years later ms hayden attended the cannes film festival on behalf of loreal along with other top models such as claudia schiffer but excellence creme soon hit its first snag though years had passed since the garnier ultra doux flop many shopkeepers still had unsold inventory and refused to carry another loreal product mr evrard tapped a young indian recruit who was helping run the business in mumbai to court neighborhood shop owners over several months in dinesh dayal hosted conferences for shopkeepers showing them the difference between excellence cremes cream based dye and liquid or powder dyes from the local godrej and super vasmol brands mr dayal also devised incentives for shopkeepers who agreed to carry the product along with a crew of loreal staffers mr dayal traveled to stores in cities such as mumbai and kolkata with insect spray and a rag they offered to help shop owners clean spider webs out of the windows and install cardboard display cases of loreal products the idea was to make the neighborhood shop more like a european drugstore the shopkeepers "felt the freshness in our approach " says mr dayal who is now loreals chief operating officer in india in the first year shops agreed to carry the product and excellence creme is now widely stocked across indian cities to target more women loreal then launched its salon business it introduced a line of hair dyes in shades from blonde to black for use in salons it set up a program to train hairdressers to use the specific salon products by loreal was training some hairdressers a year last year it built its first ever international hairdressing academy in mumbai where students learn more advanced techniques for hair cutting coloring and straightening as well as basic hygiene rules "a generation back people werent so bothered with healthy hair " says aarti sarin a year old art gallery director in delhi who visits the hair salon of a five star hotel every week for a &# head oil massage and then tames her hair with a loreal antifrizz treatment "but were more out and about and we need to take care of it " loreal says creating a new high end niche in the indian hair care market helped restore its reputation that in turn has allowed the company to venture back into mass market territory that has always been dominated by hindustan over the past few years loreal has introduced some lower priced products that go head to head with local brands its &# color naturals dye which can be spread over three applications has since rolled it out in other emerging markets such as russia and the middle east its new &# shampoo garnier fructis"long &amp strong " is advertised across india via huge billboards the ad shows a woman tugging on her braid which is stretched across freeway overpasses and along the length of a bus archana jain a year old mother who shares a three room apartment in mumbai with eight other relatives still relies on home remedies for skin care such as a mix of cream turmeric and gram flour to moisturize her face but inspired in part by the ads she has started using fructis "long &amp strong" shampoo and conditioner to wash her waist length hair twice a week she hopes it will strengthen her hair which she complains is weak "it does good to my hair " says ms jain as sandalwood incense from the familys religious shrine wafted through the apartment "its used by everyone in the family " but loreals competitors are encroaching on its upscale territory three years ago hindustan also entered the premium segment with perfect radiance face cream at &# thats seven times the price of its main fair &amp lovely line hindustan also reaches deep into even the most remote rural areas where the bulk of indias population lives though loreals distribution muscle is growing it is limited to urban areas prakash jain a pharmacist at sarvodya medical pharmacy in mumbais worli district says he sells about boxes of loreals color naturals a month but he says the pricier stuff including loreals excellence creme moves more slowly "consumers have to think twice" about buying it he says
