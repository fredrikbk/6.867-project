mutual funds willing to risk subprime heat mortgage securities dont scare managers seeking big rewards the complex investments at the heart of the subprime mortgage meltdown are turning up in mutual funds chasing higher returns some mutual funds have invested in securities backed by subprime mortgages loans to homeowners with poor credit others have snapped up collateralized debt obligations or cdos a popular way of repackaging bundles of mortgages and other debt into securities sold based on varying levels of risk these investments can behave in unexpected ways and can be tough to value the recent surge in defaults among homeowners with high risk mortgages is highlighting these risks last month two bear stearns cos hedge funds that nearly collapsed were hurt by their cdo holdings a number of mutual funds hold very high rated slices of subprime mortgage securities some of the biggest holders include the &# million franklin strategic mortgage portfolio and &# million franklin total return fund the two funds hold about and of their assets respectively in securities tied to subprime mortgages the &# billion principal investors bond &amp mortgage securities fund and &# million schroder enhanced income fund each keep about of their portfolios in subprime mortgages other funds hold smaller amounts funds like the fidelity intermediate bond fund and fidelity total bond fund hold about of the classes of residential mortgage backed securities that standard &amp poors ratings services said this week could see their ratings slashed less than of such funds are in subprime related holdings overall mutual funds have also put money in a variety of cdos which combine different kinds of debt including mortgage backed bonds junk bonds and corporate loans a review of roughly bond money market and other mutual funds tracked by reuters emaxx indicates that they hold about &# billion in various types of cdos one fund with significant cdo holdings is the &# billion regions morgan keegan select high income fund as of the end of march it had of its assets in below investment grade or unrated cdos about half of which was in mortgage related securities several other regions morgan keegan funds also held big stakes in cdos some tied to mortgage securities fund managers holding subprime mortgages say they are comfortable with their holdings despite the turmoil in the market because they are mostly high quality and because many involve loans which were issued before when the underwriting standards were stronger a franklin spokeswoman said its funds holdings are primarily short term triple a quality securities which have "not had the kind of default problems that investors have been concerned about " the franklin total return fund is down for the three months ended july but up for the year the franklin strategic mortgage portfolio is down for three months but up for the year bill armstrong a manager of principal investors bond &amp mortgage securities fund says none of its holdings have been downgraded by the rating firms "were not looking to make any big changes to the portfolio " the fund is down for the three months ended july but up for the year for investors it can be tough to tell if a fund is holding these kinds of securities and in what amount subprime mortgages for instance are often referred to in a prospectus as "home equity loans" or "asset backed securities" and the individual securities go by names like argent securities trust w class m because of the way cdos are structured it is possible for funds to invest in less risky slices of the loan pools cdos are basically divided into various slices or "tranches " based on different credit qualities some funds have focused on highly rated cdos that are in areas besides residential mortgage backed securities where many of the subprime troubles are cropping up and keep very small amounts in the holdings often less than of total assets david harris a fixed income manager at schroder investment management says the funds are "not taking a lot of risk in lower rated securities " the schroder enhanced income fund is up for the three months and for the year some fund managers are even watching the market for potential buying opportunities the hartford income fund for instance has increased its subprime mortgage holdings from at the start of the year to about at the end of june manager bill davison says they use "rigorous in depth analysis" to find these opportunities the fund is down for three months but up for the year valuation of some holdings can get complicated mutual funds are required to price everything they own once a day thats easy for stocks you check the closing price but more exotic securities like cdos dont change hands as often making valuation tougher as a result funds must estimate the price using factors such as changing market conditions or credit quality most large fund firms have "robust" policies for how to make these valuations says garry moody a partner at deloitte &amp touche llp the securities and exchange commission typically limits the holding of so called "illiquid " or thinly traded securities to of a mutual funds total assets there is concern that the troubles in subprime mortgages could worsen if so that could start to hurt even the higher rated slices of cdos that appear to be unaffected jeffrey gundlach chief investment officer of tcw group an investment firm based in los angeles voiced such concerns at a morningstar conference in chicago last month calling subprime woes an "unmitigated disaster " bill gross money manager at pimco said in a july investment outlook report that as subprime losses mount some single a rated cdo tranches could "face the grim reaper " on wednesday moodys investors service announced that it put tranches of cdos backed primarily by residential mortgage backed securities on review for possible downgrade many mutual funds hold the cdos and other mortgage backed securities that are being considered for ratings downgrades funds like the regions morgan keegan select high income fund have taken a hit due to their cdo and other mortgage related holdings the fund was among the worst performing high yield mutual funds for the past one month three month and year to date periods so far this year it is down compared to the average gain for high yield funds according to fund researcher morningstar inc fund manager jim kelsoe says the funds "diversification into mortgage backed and asset backed securities has not performed as well" as other areas like corporate junk bonds he says the mortgage slump is "the most pronounced" he has seen in more than years of fund management experience the fund is up an average annual the past three years and the past five years beating many peers funds like the &# billion putnam income fund also held stakes in cdos as of an april semiannual report mostly focused on commercial mortgage backed securities the fund is up so far this year compared to an average for intermediate term bond fund peers many closed end funds also hold cdo stakes like the &# million first trust strategic high income iii fund
