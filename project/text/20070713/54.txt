obamas extra hurdle the barack obama phenomenon has just about everybody asking is america ready for a black president overlooked in the conversation however is the fact that americans have already weighed in on black leadership and they like it enough to vote for it more than of the nations population lives in metropolitan areas that have had a black mayor in the core central city or lived in states that have had a black governor most of the rest have learned from tv and newspapers what black officeholders have or more importantly have not done in office these experiences have calmed fears and given many previously skeptical white voters reason to support black candidates when the first black challengers ran in the s and the early s to try to take over positions held by whites they faced widespread fear among white voters and opposition campaigns that were only too happy to play on that anxiety the slogan in atlanta for example was "atlantas too young to die " meanwhile the white incumbent in los angeles simply asked "will your city be safe with this man " the result was record white mobilization and near unanimous white opposition to black candidates in the typical contest when a black candidate challenged to be the first black mayor of a big city turnout of all voters averaged almost an unheard of figure for local elections and all but of the white vote went to the white candidate since those days a lot has changed well over african americans have been elected to various offices around the country and the fears that many once felt were never realized in almost every case when a black candidate won there was little or no white flight little to no movement of blacks into white neighborhoods and certainly no wholesale redistribution of resources from the white to the black community the world under black leadership was strikingly similar to the world under white leadership many white voters realizing that black politicians had the power to hurt the white community but didnt re evaluated their views of black leadership and the broader black community all of this has brought remarkable change to the white electorate the same black challengers who faced near unanimous white opposition when they first ran almost always won re election and generally did so with much more white support than they first received today campaigns cannot and do not play on the same racial fears that they did in the s and early s those scare tactics are simply no longer credible the nation has seen too many black mayors congressmen and other elected officials to believe that black leadership will translate to anything like a black takeover an even stronger sign that fears have faded away is the fact that whites are no longer mobilized to action whenever a black candidate has a chance to be a historic first turnout in city elections in which blacks have won the mayoralty for the first time has dropped every decade to the point where turnout in these elections averages half the record turnout of the s and close to the national average for mayoral contests even more important instead of fearing black candidates white americans have started supporting black candidates whereas in the s no blacks were elected in big cities with majority white populations in the s more than half of all the african americans elected in big cities won in places where the electorate was a majority white what does all of this mean for barack obama the most recent la times national poll shows him running equally well among minority and white democratic voters but he is unlikely to get most of the white vote successful black challengers at least at the mayoral level typically win about a third of the white vote given that about a third of the white population sees itself as liberal and almost all of the black candidates running in these mayoral contests are liberal democrats that figure seems reasonable fortunately for mr obama winning the white vote is not a prerequisite to winning the democratic primaries or the presidency if history repeats itself the black vote will be united behind mr obama black democratic candidates and mr obama is increasingly seen as a black candidate by african american voters seeking to become a historic first at any level have typically won close to of the black vote that black vote coupled with some latino support and the growing willingness of white americans to support black leadership could certainly be enough to give him the election but even if mr obama loses it wont be because white america is afraid of a black president the nation has seen black leaders in action and most voters are no longer frightened mr hajnal professor of political science at the university of california san diego is the author of "changing white attitudes toward black political leadership" cambridge university press
