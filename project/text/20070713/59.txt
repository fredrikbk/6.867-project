pill push industry fights switch to generics for epilepsy big drug makers help patient groups lobby more attention to states in state legislatures across the country the epilepsy foundation has been campaigning for bills that would make it harder for pharmacists to switch patients to inexpensive generic epilepsy pills the effort is getting behind the scenes support from drug companies a sign of how the industry long a potent lobbying force in washington is increasingly looking to states to achieve its goals the foundation a nonprofit group supported by the drug industry says switching to generics could cause dangerous seizures the food and drug administration says it hasnt seen persuasive evidence for that and it believes each generic is equivalent to the brand name drug it copies four major brand name drugs used for epilepsy are expected to lose patent protection and face generic competition between next year and those four drugs generated &# billion in u s sales last year according to ims health meaning the state legislation could have a significant bottom line impact some of the &# billion figure reflects sales of the drugs for other ailments generic drugs are the centerpiece of efforts to tame growth in americas prescription drug bill which topped &# billion in when a doctor writes a prescription for a brand name drug pharmacists are usually permitted in most states to make an automatic switch to a generic judged equivalent by the fda the epilepsy legislation would carve out an exception to that rule with many of the bills requiring that doctors explicitly approve such a switch tennessee has passed a weaker version that requires doctor notification but not consent around other states have considered some form of restriction in the past year it isnt the only health issue where states have been the central battleground earlier this year merck &amp co drew fire for lobbying states to require that preteen girls receive its cervical cancer vaccine to attend school merck stopped its direct lobbying in february but a group of female state legislators who receive funding from the drug maker continue to push for the laws states often move faster than congress says jan faiks who runs state policy for the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america or phrma the drug industrys trade group state legislation can move "from idea to passage to governors signature in days sometimes faster than that " she says "so the action is in the states " campaign contributions to state candidates by pharmaceutical manufacturers and their employees rose to about &# million for from about &# million for according to the national institute on money in state politics drug makers spent more than &# million on state lobbying in and the last years for which figures are available according to the center for public integrity in state legislatures as in congress the drug industry often enlists nonprofit health and patient advocacy groups to advance its agenda in the epilepsy case the epilepsy foundations state affiliates rather than the companies are taking the most prominent part in the lobbying the foundation and its state affiliates receive funding from the epilepsy drug makers glaxosmithkline plc and ucb sa donated &# to &# each in fiscal to the national foundation according to its annual report abbott laboratories and a johnson &amp johnson unit each contributed &# to &# representatives of four drug companies sit on the foundations board as does phrma chief billy tauzin the foundation and its affiliates had about &# million in revenue in about &# million of which came from state and federal grants the foundation says its diverse funding base shields it from undue drug company influence and the industry executives on its board didnt participate in discussions of the drug switching issue foundation leaders note that the state bills would generally require doctor permission for several kinds of switches including when a patient goes from a generic to a brand "these are peoples lives that were talking about nothing about stock options and stock value and how this would affect companies bottom line that would be insulting to us to have discussions like that " says sindi rosales the head of a foundation affiliate in texas one of the states that weighed legislation this year she says pharmaceutical companies are "fabulous partners" and their help in several areas "has been amazingly tremendous " but the companies leave it to the foundation to call the shots for their part company executives describe their lobbying role as limited and say the bills were primarily an initiative of the foundation although they acknowledge in certain cases that company officials have gotten directly involved executives say the aim of these activities is to protect the health of patients "our issue is not selfish toward our individual product " says richard denness a vice president at belgium based ucb "its a real concern in the minds of prescribers all it takes in the scheme of things are one or two patients to have a tragic event " in the late s the national epilepsy foundation based in landover md raised concerns about anecdotal reports that some patients experienced seizures and side effects after switching epilepsy drugs some of the episodes involved patients who had been switched to a generic from a branded drug the foundation also worried about cases in which patients were switched from one generic version of a drug to another generic version of the same drug when the fda approves generics it requires manufacturers to show in human studies that their copycat pills deliver a similar amount of active ingredient to the bloodstream as the brand name original however the agency doesnt require exact equivalence that would be an impossible bar to clear because there is always a slight variation in the way people absorb drugs the foundation theorized that some generic pills had a meaningful difference from the brands this difference it postulated meant patients were getting more or less of the drug in their blood causing some of them to have seizures or side effects foundation officials floated the idea in a meeting with the fda the fdas response "show us the data " recalls sandy finucane who oversees state and federal policy for the foundation the agency unpersuaded by what it saw stood firm in its long held position that the difference was too small to have a tangible impact on patients coming up with the kind of evidence the fda sought would have required a major clinical trial to demonstrate that the seizures were a direct result of the switches ms finucane says the foundation thought it would be difficult to enroll patients for such a trial and the costs were prohibitive she says for years the foundation didnt push the matter beyond developing policy statements and encouraging patients and doctors to report problems to the fda in early the issue re emerged as legislation requiring doctor permission for switches was proposed in illinois thats the home state of abbott laboratories which makes depakote a leading epilepsy pill that is expected to face generic competition next year the bill passed but in watered down form an epilepsy foundation official in illinois says abbott helped fund lobbying for stronger provisions that were considered this year but didnt pass abbott said it supports some foundation initiatives but declined to give specifics in may the national epilepsy foundation convened a committee of medical experts to examine the question the committee found a lack of authoritative studies showing that such drug switches cause problems says its chairman steven schachter a harvard medical school neurologist nonetheless it recommended that doctors give explicit approval for switches citing anecdotal reports of seizures and noting that such attacks can be serious last fall the american academy of neurology issued a statement making a similar recommendation the academy says it receives funding from drug makers for educational programs but not for developing medical guidelines at a meeting last september the national foundation told its local affiliates that if they wanted to push for legislation regulating switches the foundation would provide model legislation and support ms finucane says it also told them to "maintain independence from any company thats going to be interested in this issue " she adds the plus affiliates operate largely autonomously the sponsor of a bill in georgia state rep charlice byrd says a ucb official was the first person to raise the epilepsy drug switching issue with her the belgian company makes the epilepsy drug keppra ms byrd says she was sympathetic because her late mother had epilepsy charlotte thompson who joined the foundations georgia affiliate as executive director last september says she became aware of the bill after hearing about it from ucb "when we realized rep byrd was introducing this and looked at it and studied what it was then we jumped on the bandwagon " ms thompson says six lobbyists for three companies joined a committee created by the epilepsy foundation to work on the legislative process she says ms byrd says several pharmaceutical company lobbyists offered their support abbott lobbyist guy mosier "was extremely helpful working with legislators to help them understand the importance and that this piece of legislation was strictly for patient protection " ms byrd says mr mosier declined to comment ms byrd introduced the bill in the georgia house in january of this year at a feb hearing of the houses health committee lasa joiner executive director of the georgia psychiatric physicians association testified in support ms joiner was at the time also a glaxo lobbyist which she didnt mention at the hearing in an interview she said she didnt raise her tie to glaxo because the company hadnt asked her to lobby for the bill two days later epilepsy patients and parents of patients visited lawmakers offices to ask them to support the bill the epilepsy foundations ms thompson says drug company lobbyists accompanied the visitors kimberly oviedo says her year old daughter had seizures last year after being switched to a generic version of the epilepsy drug zonegran she says she supported the bill because she wouldnt "want any other person to have to go through what weve been through with our kids " ms oviedo also has a son who suffers from epilepsy the bill passed the georgia house in a vote on feb but it stalled in the senate after groups representing pharmacists and generic drug makers mounted heftier opposition to it in that chamber pharmacies often earn bigger profit margins on generics than on branded drugs ms thompson says the foundation plans to meet with the georgia senate leadership this summer to try to gather its support for next year in texas two local epilepsy foundation affiliates decided to approach an abbott official after they resolved to push for a bill says ms rosales the head of one of the affiliates abbott and other drug makers helped fund the foundations texas lobbying she says ms rosales whose daughter used to have seizures says she felt deeply about the bill but worried about being perceived as a "mouthpiece for the pharmaceutical industry " she nonetheless hired santos alliances a firm that also represents phrma as her affiliates lobbyist ms rosales says its difficult to find a health care lobbyist with no drug maker clients frank santos head of the lobbying firm says phrma was "absolutely not involved" with the bill at a march hearing in the texas senate ron hartmann a lobbyist for a generic drug maker owned by novartis ag of switzerland testified against the bill he said he suspected the bill was "less focused on the citizens of texas than on protecting the market share of a few brand name drugs that are scheduled to go off patent in the next few years " state sen kyle janek the bills sponsor responded that mr hartmann had "impugned my motivations " and added that if mr hartmann would "abstain from doing that " then he would abstain from calling mr hartmann a "high priced shill " mr hartmann apologized in sen janek received about &# in campaign contributions from drug makers he says he sponsored the bill because it was in the best interests of patients the bill passed the state senate in april but failed to come up to a vote in the house after debate in that chambers health committee three of the committees members said in interviews later that they were skeptical of the bill because they thought it was being pushed by drug companies generic drug makers and pharmacists lobbied heavily against the bill meanwhile some doctors are pushing harder for a study that would settle the matter michel berg a neurologist who is chairman of an american epilepsy society task force examining the switching issue has opened discussions with the fda about what kind of trial would be necessary for now gary buehler the director of the fdas office of generic drugs says the agency is skeptical that the drug switches cause seizures "the only way you can somehow pin this down is to do a good study " says mr buehler
