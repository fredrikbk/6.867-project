duke must erase culture of intolerance and fear i am moved to respond to charles falks july letter decrying the silence by the duke administration in regard to the "group of " silence and time are a criminals friend and the duke administration by being silent is an accessory to the crime that this group of professors committed the sixth amendment demands a speedy trial for those accused thus the saying "justice delayed is justice denied " perhaps the duke administration with its feckless treatment of its tenured staff hopes that by being silent this will eventually blow over and duke can go back to teaching our children about justice habeus corpus and the terrible villains that would deny us our rights to these things and then maybe in another class teach about irony but until the members of this group of publicly apologize for their actions the moral authority of the entire faculty is questioned and they have no right to discuss with our children about the values that we hold dear and that brave men and women have died defending and it ought to be an apology as strong as the original message say a paid advertisement in a prominent newspaper with all of their signatures but it should not be just one of them breaking ranks and feeling a little guilty claiming to speak for all of them in a second sound bite i would never send my children to duke now that i can see that its faculty would gang up and deny its own students basic freedoms and rights that we cherish i would not donate money to duke or attend its basketball games since doing so supports this culture of intolerance and fear as long as the group of and the duke administration remain silent they have the moral equivalence of a dictatorship the original action of the group of was outrageous but their silence and that of the administration is even more so peter mcdougall san diego
