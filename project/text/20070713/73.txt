special needs mean special problems how must schools cope your article on restraints and autistic students "when discipline starts a fight " page one july brought back painful memories of my daughter who as a young teen was so violent that she drew the blood of her teachers nonetheless i was convinced that a restrictive environment was wrong and we fought bitterly to keep her in the school system the system relented and made an initial investment to allow her to succeed including an autism and behavior specialist an aide and important supports like visual schedules and alternative communications mechanisms after a year the additional staff was faded out people with autism are sentient intelligent human beings often trapped in a prison of silence and frustrating sensory realities without language how do they communicate their needs or tell you of their anguish what my daughter taught us is that all behavior is communication and all you have to do is listen abusive restraints are never the answer appropriate support is in fact more restrictive environments are ultimately more expensive to taxpayers rendering adequate training and support the more cost effective solution my daughter is now and she hasnt had a violent episode for over eight years she lives with a caregiver and works daily doing valuable community service she is a happy thriving human being with a meaningful life as dr martin luther king said "violence is the language of the unheard " leila mcdowell head herndon va while i cannot condone the treatment isabel received i can certainly understand the frustration of the teacher involved any student or teacher who has been in a class with a child as disruptive as isabel knows that the situation is intolerable all around one such child in a classroom has the capacity to hold the entire class and the teacher hostage when will the rights of the other students be given the same consideration as the rights of the disabled child if you are going to mainstream disabled children you must provide appropriate support however like most school funding this support is woefully inadequate when we address the root problems with education we will be much more equipped to deal with the special cases until then we seem doomed to the same destructive patterns that have prevailed since mainstreaming became an issue christine campbell high school teacher fort lauderdale fla special schools arent segregation but a place for those whose presence interferes with the learning of others robert o fisch minneapolis thank you for helping to expose the abusive ways special needs children are treated in some public schools the alarming rise of disabilities such as autism coupled with a shortage of experienced and trained teachers is creating an educational atmosphere where these students are tossed aside without even the basic dignity and rights afforded to patients in mental hospitals and criminals in our prison systems we have experienced this problem firsthand a childs rights shouldnt end at the front door of his school the child should be afforded the same protections under the law as hardened criminals hopefully exposing these stories will help make this happen paul and lisbeth ehrlich darien conn your article was heartbreaking the loefflers and their autistic daughter isabel have suffered the school district appears to have attempted to accommodate isabel although some of their methods are troubling as parents of a year old autistic son we have been very fortunate that our child has responded well to his school environment it has been a learning experience for us and the school district which thus far has done an excellent job of accommodating his special needs and placing him in an environment where he can learn we see that school curriculum is designed to educate the average child when a child has special needs the time effort and expense of education increase exponentially parents have to be very engaged with the district to ensure that everyone is in agreement on the teaching strategies however parents must at times concede that the public school setting may not be appropriate for their child even though laws mandate free and appropriate education for all tim hanson eden prairie minn
