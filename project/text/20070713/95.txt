weekend journal review television madison avenue revisited mad men" an old term for the fevered cadres who made madison avenue advertising run is the title now of a new amc series thursdays p m edt that is like its subject not modest in its ambition to embark on an effort to re create a time years in the past an attempt at once exuberant and scholarly as it works out here is no small trick nor is it a small achievement that creator matthew weiner a former writer for "the sopranos" and company have managed in this part opus one of the best written all around sparkling works to come along in many a summer season thats not to say its not without its flaws and false notes which dont detract much from the sparkle but they are there and there perhaps inevitably given this effort to re create the tone and color of the period the year but essentially the s and of the advertising world it produced the madison avenue of this series emerges as roughly the same corporate universe that has been portrayed in novel after novel film after film as the enemy of all that is human in this handy microcosm a generation of writers found a place to hang grievances about the false gods of capitalism the corporate man the list is long its not easy today to shake either the s or that old madison avenue free of all the fiction hung on them and it should be said that "mad men" doesnt try it is instead an updated version of that fiction which is to say theres very little of the old grimness in it or depictions of life draining heart attack giving cruelties of big business and all its cutthroat competition of the sort portrayed in rod serlings darkly powerful "patterns" which first appeared on kraft television theatre and went on to become a feature film or in sloan wilsons novel "the man in the grey flannel suit" "mad men" is infinitely more concerned with entertainment an effort at which it succeeds thanks mostly to its first rate cast disarming humor and period detail that humor appears as a kind of undercurrent in all the jabbing reminders we get about all that has changed since the series takes place in an era as the script maintains in one of the early episodes when it was possible to smack the face of the little boy next door as one dreadful adult male does to teach the child a lesson about behavior the boy had knocked over a glass while running around the house during a birthday party and it was possible to do this were shown without objection from the childs father standing by as the writers clearly understand everybody watching this scene knows what would happen today to someone who felt entitled to discipline a neighbors child with a slap in the face a less brutal scene about the food served at the party offers an especially mischievous moment in which the hostess rattles on about the food to be served to the children their menu includes peanut butter because she notes comfortably theyll all eat that the adults at that suburban birthday party also get to eat date nut bread and waldorf salad were told which may be going a bit far even for satire line after line the intended reminders of that past come none so sharp as those involving the humiliations visited on women women especially who have to work daily in the environment run by these madison avenue males most of them nonstop jokers on the make who see in every woman at the office every woman that is so unfortunate as to walk about the universe unmarried an opportunity to pounce in the society of "mad men " the women accorded protection are those who have won a husband in one cruelly convincing scene peggy a young office worker played by elizabeth moss who has had a fling with pete a spoiled jerk of an ad exec deftly portrayed by vincent kartheiser watches in pain the queenly status accorded the newly married petes bride when she visits the office even the leading man of this series the rare thoughtful not to mention haunted ad man don draper played by a heroically gorgeous jon hamm cant abide being contradicted by an important prospective customer and storms from the meeting because as he rages he is "not going to let a woman talk that way to me " the line has a ring of truth that is unmistakable it is however a ring decidedly thin in most of the other portraits of these ad men who joke mirthlessly about women and talk nonstop smartly cynical talk all day long even in the s in a madison avenue ad agency their gender notwithstanding men surely had a human exchange or two in this series as in all those aforementioned treatments of the s and madison avenue the writers have their eyes on a connected target the suburbs invariably portrayed as a swamp of uniformity loveless marriages where the executive boobs live and covet their neighbors wives while their own are busy elsewhere betty dons wife is for instance busy seeing a therapist this leads to one of the more sharply etched period scenes the ever silent therapist taking notes as the patient on the couch casts nervously about for some word from this silent figure which of course never comes she was brought up to think it impolite to talk about ones self she explains not to worry betty soon gets the hang of it her husband has the hang of the ad business but not his place in it though there are hints in the first episodes of some mysterious past none of it detracts from this characters defining identity hes a man with a quest an ad man who spends the most intimate moments with women not all of them with the one hes married to searching for an ad mans answer what does a woman want that is what does she want to buy what will appeal for all its ventures into social satire this is above all a story of career and ambition a focus in which "mad men" remains steadfast one good reason among several for its compelling power
