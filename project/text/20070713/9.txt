broadcom options probe shifts to ex ceo a federal criminal investigation into stock options backdating at broadcom corp has taken an unusual turn probing allegations of drug usage and other excesses by the companys co founder and former chief executive henry t nicholas iii the allegations surfaced in a civil lawsuit filed earlier this year by kenji kato a former personal assistant and bodyguard to mr nicholas mr kato who claims he worked for mr nicholas on and off from to alleges in a case filed in los angeles superior court that he was forced to indulge in illegal narcotics with his boss whom he portrays as leading a raucous lifestyle that included spiking clients drinks and offering prostitutes to customers an attorney for mr nicholas strongly denies the allegations and says mr kato is a troubled former contract worker who fabricated the events to extort money from the admittedly high living technology executive mr nicholas resigned from broadcom four years ago the u s attorneys office in orange county calif which is leading the backdating probe has taken an interest in mr katos claims the federal bureau of investigation interviewed mr kato in april according to people close to the situation and has quizzed other former employees and associates of mr nicholas early this week several fbi agents showed up outside the gate of mr nicholass sprawling home in newport coast calif with subpoenas summoning several employees of the billionaire to answer questions before a grand jury they included a woman identified in mr katos lawsuit as a girlfriend of mr nicholass who allegedly supplied him with heroin and other drugs she denies the claims mr nicholass attorney says mr kato originally sought a &# million payment "when youre a billionaire youre hit up literally frequently " mr silverstein says "we dont pay extortion " prompted by the nicholas camp local authorities are conducting a separate criminal investigation into the alleged extortion plot mr katos lawyer joseph kar says there was no extortion "there was merely an attempt to reach a settlement which mr nicholass camp invited " he says mr kato is now seeking &# million in settlement money plus unspecified damages for his forced resignation due to what he alleges was a hostile workplace mr silverstein also questions the governments transformation of a securities case into an excavation of mr nicholass personal life "what does this have to do with options " mr silverstein says mr nicholas who was ceo when most of the disputed options were issued hasnt been charged in the federal probe and it is unclear how any supposed drug use would play into a securities fraud investigation a person familiar with the matter says there is no indication broadcom paid for any alleged drug purchases an aggressive legal theory being examined by prosecutors is whether broadcom failed to disclose to investors that mr nicholass purported drug use hindered his ability to be ceo the people close to the situation said the federal agents also are looking at whether mr nicholas and his companies illegally structured transactions to evade currency reporting requirements according to people familiar with the situation "were confident that at all times the companys public disclosures regarding dr nicholas were appropriate and complied fully with all legal requirements " said david siegel an outside counsel for broadcom who said mr nicholas played a "critical" role in building the company over his year tenure as ceo edward h frank broadcoms vice president of research and development disputes the notion that mr nicholas was incapacitated during his last years at broadcom "nick was on point until the day he had to leave " mr frank says adding that it would be "hard to imagine that someone who executed as well as nick had a substance abuse problem " broadcom an irvine calif chipmaker is one of the biggest companies caught up in the federal probe which is examining whether scores of companies improperly backdated stock option grants to enhance potential profits for executives and other employees broadcom has admitted to widespread backdating of its options and restated several years of results taking &# billion in charges against earnings it was the biggest restatement so far in the scandal a board led investigation concluded that mr nicholas bore "significant responsibility" for the manipulation mr nicholas didnt benefit personally from any of the problematic grants but he was one of two people on the committee that handed out employee options mr nicholas is still one of broadcoms largest shareholders through a trust he and his wife stacey control a stake currently valued at about &# billion mr nicholas previously has sold broadcom stock worth more than &# million in his suit mr kato claims he started to work as an independent contractor for mr nicholas in and helped arrange many aspects of the executives life including visits to rock concerts and sporting events mr kato alleges a descent into heavy drug use by his former boss at times he claims mr nicholas would stay up for days at a time fueled by multiple substances in later years mr nicholas was such a heavy drug user mr kato alleges in court filings that his behavior was often "erratic" and he was "regularly confused " mr kato also alleges the broadcom chief spiked the drinks of clients without their consent "i would see him put powdered ecstasy pills into the drinks of his customers " mr kato claims in a court declaration "other times when we were at tradeshows in las vegas it was normal for nick to request and send prostitutes to his customers to entertain them " mr kato states in the declaration he and his lawyer declined to name the broadcom customers who allegedly used prostitutes or who unknowingly ingested drugs mr silverstein says there were no prostitutes "there were girls who worked in the booths and entertained customers " he says mr silverstein described the drug spiking allegations as "ludicrous " saying no such things happened
