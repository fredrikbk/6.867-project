weekend journal the home front gardens with a buzz homeowners brave stings to attract beleaguered bees the lemonade incident here is the latest buzz in eco heroism bee gardens amid reports about the widespread decline of the honeybee population increasing numbers of homeowners are braving stings and sometimes alarming neighbors by turning their yards into bee friendly habitats some are shunning pesticides planting flowers that bees like and even creating nesting sites for the beleaguered insects european honeybees major crop pollinators that were imported to this country almost four centuries ago have been dying off in huge numbers from mysterious causes everything from parasitic mites to cell phones have been implicated in their decline now the garden industry is pushing homeowners to create bee gardens that will attract and nourish them as well as other indigenous species the latest campaigns emphasize insects over aesthetics most promote native plants which often have smaller and less showy blooms than cultivated hybrids but more of the nectar and pollen that attract honeybees suppliers are also pitching products that can provide shelter for some of the native species such as orchard and leaf cutter bees that experts say could take up the slack should their european cousins continue to disappear such efforts have a direct connection to americas dinner tables one third of the food eaten in this country is pollinated by insects according to the department of agriculture and the honeybee is responsible for of that pollination without which plants wont bear fruits seeds vegetables or nuts the honeybee is the countrys foremost crop pollinator says troy fore executive director of the american beekeeper federation but if native bee populations are robust mr fore says "we wont starve " after reading about the distressed honeybees janet allen decided to give up pesticides last summer and turn her square foot yard in syracuse n y into an insect habitat the retired software engineer filled her front yard with beds of colorful plants favored by honeybees such as milkweed penstemon and goldenrod she bought unusual varieties so neighbors wouldnt recognize them as roadside weeds she also put in half a dozen "bee boxes" that she bought online for about &# a piece the boxes attract some native species that unlike hive dwelling honeybees prefer to go it alone nesting in individual burrows in logs or holes in the soil her husband a lawyer built two more this spring from scratch using scrap lumber and elderberry bush stems the couples two adult children think this preoccupation with bees the yard now attracts dozens of the furry pollinators is "crazy " but ms allen considers it a higher calling "its part of our responsibility as parents to leave a living planet " while its unclear what if anything backyard bee gardens will be able to do to stop the decline of the honeybee theres no question that the insect is in trouble though periodic die offs have occurred before most recently in the s the current bee decline which started about five years ago took a turn for the worse last fall according to the apiary inspectors of america about a quarter of the million commercial hives have been lost since then no one tracks the number of bee gardens in the u s and they arent being promoted in big box stores like lowes and home depot but the home and garden firms that do sell bee related products report that sales are sweet smith &amp hawken in novato calif says sales are strong for bee plants that it markets online such as spanish lavender and an echinacea called "fatal attraction" a buddleia called "honeycomb" is sold out another major retailer dutch gardens a division of gardeners supply in burlington vt recently published a "pollinator primer" on its web site that explains the preferences of various types of bees with links to popular plants it sells such as "fireball" monarda and hardy gloxinia sales of such plants are up over last year the company says raintree nursery in morton wash says year over year sales of its "bee blocks" wooden blocks seeded with the young of mason bees that can be placed in flowerbeds are up and windowbox com a vernon calif retailer says sales of its &# "bird bee and butterfly garden" have doubled this year over last while sales of bee and wasp traps have dropped it takes a certain amount of nerve and a leap of faith for even the most ecologically committed gardeners to get over their fear of bees despite the fact that native species are largely nonaggressive and have mild stings honeybees also mild mannered do attack if theyre swatted or stepped on causing anything from a painful red bump to a deadly reaction in allergic individuals so it was with some trepidation that jennifer odonovan bought a bee garden from windowbox com earlier this spring her year old daughter megan had become fascinated with some docile honeybees shed seen at a nearby pond and her mother wanted to encourage her to help the environment when it came time to plant the flower seeds the mendon mass homemaker picked a tiny plot as far away from her childrens play set as she could now she and her daughter watch the dozen or so bees that have started to frequent the flowers but from a safe distance "i know bees are important " says ms odonovan "but i also know what they can do " so does abbey duke a catering company owner who recently created a bee garden in her burlington vt yard filled with flowering herbs interspersed with old logs into which she drilled holes for nests earlier this summer however she was a bit horrified when at a barbecue the host a fellow bee gardener accidentally drank one of the insects after it landed on his glass of lemonade and stung his tongue he spent the rest of the party moaning in pain and sucking on an ice cube still ms duke has no plans to give up her own backyard apiary which she considers important to the environment "im hard to scare " she says utah state university bee biologist jim cane says that while some bees have specialized food and nesting needs others are "broad floral generalists " not particularly fussy about what they eat or where they live bees can sustain themselves for a long time on the robust flowering weeds commonly found on small vacant city lots for example in fact many types of bees prefer the small single blossoms of weeds and wildflowers to the huge double blooms of hybrids such as tea roses or carnations which are bred to produce extra petals rather than nectar and pollen realizing this jan josifek a weaver has allowed invasive and gangly plants that she doesnt really like like fleabane goldenrod and bellflower to flourish in her three st paul minn flowerbeds the plants are full of bees all season but at a price she must give up space shed rather use for showier flowers and spends tedious hours "deadheading " or removing the wildflowers spent blossoms after the bees have fertilized them "if i didnt the plants would make millions of seeds and take over my yard " she says some entomologists are so convinced of the importance of creating backyard habitats that theyre planting bee gardens in their own yards noticing that the gardens in his neighborhood are mostly filled with hybrid flowers lansing mich entomologist rufus isaacs has planted native perennials and berries that attract hordes of bees as well as nervous neighbors "the bees are too busy eating to worry about humans as long as you watch and dont bother them " mr isaacs says tucson ariz entomologist justin o schmidt whose legendary "sting pain index" is derived from his observations of being personally stung by more than species and genera of venomous insects is similarly blase he recently added a black light to his yard to draw bees to plantings of milkweed desert broom and butterfly bush two weeks ago his year old son went out to look at the light and was stung on his bare foot by a honeybee "my son was squawking but i used it as a teachable moment " says mr schmidt who calmly told his son that if hed been wearing shoes he would have avoided the incident beekeepers have reported that entire colonies of honeybees an average commercial hive holds bees let loose in fields to help with crop pollination have failed to return to their nests and studies of stray dead bees found on the ground have shown them riddled with a combination of viruses bacteria and fungi the exact cause of the bee problem dubbed colony collapse disorder is a mystery says mr fore of the beekeeper federation various theories have been raised including overuse of pesticides mite infestation and even wireless or cellphone use the signals purportedly confuse the bees ability to return to the hives susan moser a morton wash organic farmer recently decided to turn her front lawn into a clover filled meadow to attract wild bees and she says she looks the other way when they drill holes into her front porch two decades ago she kept a few honeybee hives around but quit after a few years because it was too much trouble to keep the sticky boxes clean giving up a patch of lawn and allowing bees to live literally in her house is a lot easier and seems like a small sacrifice for the besieged creatures that pollinate her apple trees raspberry bushes and other plants "its stressful to be a bee " she says
