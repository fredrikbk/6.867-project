mr volatility and the swan market tumult brings the hedgie cum author out of his retirement mr volatility is back nassim nicholas taleb was last seen holstering his trading guns in after his hedge fund empirica capital llc posted several years of lackluster returns when the funds bets on a market swoon failed to pay off as stocks rose steadily now mr taleb has a new book "the black swan the impact of the highly improbable " a bestseller that follows his "fooled by randomness " published in which enjoys a cult like status in the hedge fund industry he also is helping to launch a hedge fund universa investments lp the santa monica calif firm started in january with a fund of about &# million in assets under management and according to people familiar with the firm is raising more than &# billion for a separate fund based on mr talebs ideas mr taleb believes most investors underestimate the likelihood of seeing a black swan which he defines as extreme highly disruptive events that send shockwaves through financial markets and that there are huge profits to be made in such conditions the title alludes to the belief in the west widely held until european explorers discovered the black swans that are native to australia that all swans are white to call something a black swan was to imply it didnt exist the launch of universa may have auspicious timing that will test mr talebs theories jitters about whether the widening subprime mortgage meltdown will rattle the financial system are spreading still the markets in the past few years have sailed through such white knuckle events as hurricane katrina and the &# billion meltdown of the amaranth advisors hedge fund yesterdays rally suggests investors may shrug off the latest wave of fear economists say low volatility reflects low global inflation coordinated central bank policies and the rise of lower cost labor markets that have smoothed the wrinkles in the worlds economic fabric they also say the proliferation of hedge funds and derivatives have given markets highly sensitive shock absorbers that damp volatility mr taleb wont be directly involved in day to day trading at universa instead he will be an adviser and will have a large stake in it mark spitznagel a former empirica trader will manage the funds daily activities primarily mr taleb will be enjoying the success of "the black swan " which has been on the wall street journal business bestseller list for more than two months the book marks the evolution from wall street trader to ivory tower philosopher long sought by mr taleb who sports a salt and pepper beard and favors dark turtleneck sweaters "nassim is philosopher trader " mr spitznagel says mr taleb was born in lebanon and attended the university of pennsylvanias wharton school in the early s before moving to new york to try his luck on wall street in he earned a doctorate in financial mathematics at the university of paris his trading career has been characterized by long periods of lackluster returns punctuated by sudden jackpots a hallmark of his unique investing approach empirica started in was designed to offer large investors typically other hedge funds protection from huge market declines in it had a return of about after fees as the dot com stock bubble burst the average hedge fund returned just that year according to hedge fund research inc the funds returns soon dwindled as a widely followed measure of market volatility the chicago board options exchanges implied volatility index or vix plunged to historic lows empirica posted losses in and in and in and it had low single digit gains two years when hedge funds posted average returns of and respectively it had about &# million under management when it returned most of its assets to investors despite the middling performance most investors in empirica didnt try to pull out mr taleb says "we certainly didnt want our money back " says peter forbes director at lynx investment advisory a washington d c investment firm with more than &# billion in assets mr taleb says it was the daily grind of trading in a low volatility market that motivated him to quit "i burned out " he says "if i go three or four years without a big bang in the market i start having battle fatigue " so he turned his attention to writing "the black swan " published in april by random house in it he argues that most investors dont properly understand the risks they are taking and overlook ways to survive a steep market decline many investors plan for rainy days he says but not for tornadoes in part that is because the use of common measures of risk on wall street trick investors into thinking the past is predictive he says in particular he cites reliance on the bell curve a chart plotting the distribution of data like stock prices or the heights of all people in a room in normal distribution the chart resembles a bell with rare events being plotted at the bottom edge of the bell his black swan events however fall so far on the outer edges of the bell that investors underestimate the odds that such events will occur thus bets on market rattling events can be made on the cheap his investing strategy is marked by trades that yield small losses over time but that can generate outsize returns if the market or individual stocks make sudden extreme moves it works in part like this consider a stock trading at &# a share mr taleb will buy an option from another hedge fund that gives him the ability to sell the fund that stock within the next six months for &# known as the "strike price " since such a drastic move is highly unlikely the option can be had cheaply for cents or so if the stock was to tumble to &# mr taleb sells the &# stock to the hedge fund for &# and pockets the difference if the stock doesnt even fall to &# the option expires worthless and his loss is modest to generate short term returns during times of low volatility he also sells options very close to the current price of a security such options are pricier since the odds that they will be cashed in are greater they also can be risky for the seller during times of moderate volatility when the underlying shares are more likely to punch through the strike price that is why the strategy works well during times of extremely high or low volatility but it can suffer when volatility is at moderate levels "i dont want rain i want droughts or floods " mr taleb says
