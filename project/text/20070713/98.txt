weekend journal taste de gustibus naval gazing a top gun fantasy comes true aboard the uss harry s truman an hour before dusk the air crew of the uss truman several hundred men and women of every rank and job description gathers at the front end of the deck to walk its foot length looking for tiny pieces of debris a stray piece of metal sucked into the intake of a fighter jet could cause catastrophic damage to the plane and the pilot and terrible damage to the ship "we dont think of this as a dangerous business " says rear adm bill gortney an f pilot who also commands the trumans battle group of cruisers destroyers and submarines "its just a terribly unforgiving one " on this particular evening however the rigors of navy life seem briefly to melt away from the foredeck i see a school of dolphins leaping from the water off to starboard whales are just breaking the surface the deck is nearly clear except for a detachment of seahawk helicopters that has returned from an anti submarine warfare exercise activity will resume at a frenetic pace later tonight as the carrier undergoes qualification exercises but for now the truman seems remarkably serene and oddly small a dot in the ocean tracing a southerly course miles off the virginia shore to spend some time on an aircraft carrier is to be disabused of more than a few "top gun" inspired fantasies the pilots are low key and self effacing the women in their lives so to speak are often their fellow pilots or in the case of f squadron leader sara joyner their commanding officer the sleek but unwieldy f tomcat that tom cruise pretended to fly and that was once the subject of my adolescent day dreaming has been scrapped to the immense relief of the entire profession of naval aviators and mechanics i arrived here this afternoon from norfolk naval station courtesy of one of the ships c greyhound transport planes the greyhound which looks as if it sprang from the womb of howard hughess spruce goose is pounds of flying metal that must set itself down on the pitching deck of a ship at knots and come to a complete stop in two seconds and or so feet our pilot made the "trap" on the first try but tonight adm gortney will watch from his seat on the bridge as freshly minted pilots "nuggets " in navy parlance miss their traps and "bolter" off the deck to try again as he does he recalls his own "night in the barrel" as a young pilot and his fighter jockey bravado softens perceptibly into fatherly concern for his men and women aloft in the darkness the view of the ship from the bridge is an inspiring one as is just about every other sight on the carrier above or below deck from a weapons hold below the waterline ordnance officer stephen folsom matter of factly explains the methods by which guided and bunker busting bombs each weighing pounds are maintained assembled and moved as needed to the planes above by my rough count the hold contains about bombs and there are no fewer than other such holds on the ship i find myself entertaining the idea of offering the same tour to mahmoud ahmadinejad it would serve him well as a lesson in humility but while jets and bombs make for terrific tourist attractions by far the most impressive aspect of the ship is the system that recruits plus volunteers few of them older than and teaches them to run the ship it takes years to make a fighter pilot and anywhere between seven to months sometimes longer to train enlistees "continuity of culture" is the greatest challenge facing the navy says herm shelanski the ships captain "every year a quarter of the crew is brand new you dont just pick leadership and skills off a tree you build it from the ground up " of the sailors i meet some are here to make a better life others a different life paige young joined the navy mainly "to get out of my town" of gillette wyo what surprises her most about navy life "the diversity of people " she says she now works flight ops from the bridge david andre an enlisted man in his early s holds a masters degree in international relations he joined for a taste of military life and now wants to apply for the officers course cynthia trammel had wanted to join the navy ever since her father took her to air shows of the blue angels shes responsible for an inconspicuous gatling gun at the ships stern that can fire mm tungsten rounds at a rate of a minute against incoming missiles "ive nicknamed her myrtle " ms trammel tells me "she is demanding " the navy operates carriers like the truman no other navy in the world comes close the chinese who would love to have one or more carriers of their own recently sent their top admiral for a tour of the truman adm gortney recalls that the chinese were mainly interested in two things the first was the ships arresting gear the heavy cables that trap landing planes the second was the way the navy recruits trains organizes and motivates its sailors no doubt the chinese will one day figure out the mechanics of landing planes at sea and of catapulting them off the deck i wonder if theyll ever get the human element right the men and women of the truman are here as a matter of their own free will in order to defend our collective right to live freely thats more than a matter of mechanics its a matter of spirit the true source of the trumans awesome power and of its beauty too mr stephens
