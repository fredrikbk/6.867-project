rio alcan deal pressures alcoa titan faces a crossroads after losing takeover bid seek new target or suitor trumped by a much higher and friendly bid alcoa inc rescinded its hostile tender offer for rival aluminum maker alcan inc raising speculation that it would seek other partners or become the target of a takeover itself alcoas stock price rose almost yesterday to &# in new york stock exchange composite trading contributing to a big rise in the dow jones industrial average and giving it a market capitalization of &# billion although alcoa and its chairman alain belda said the company plans to stand alone industry observers questioned that strategy given the rapid consolidation in the industry and the increasing importance of heft in the mining and metals sector "alcoa certainly looks like the fish flopping on the beach right now " said john anton a steel analyst at research firm global insight it also increases scrutiny on australias rio tinto plc which agreed to buy alcan for &# billion and new chief executive tom albanese the deal marks a departure from the companys traditionally conservative image and represents a bet that the four year global commodities boom has legs but some analysts and industry observers called the price and multiples rio tinto offered for alcan "stratospheric" and suggested alcoa was wise to back away from bidding any higher the deal ends a two year effort by alcoa to court its canadian rival and amounts to a major disappointment for mr belda when initial efforts to do a deal on a friendly basis failed alcoa made a hostile roughly &# billion cash and stock offer for alcan mr belda said in a statement that rios offer for alcan "strongly reinforces our view of the underlying value in the aluminum industry and its bright prospects for the future " mr belda said that at rios offering price level "we have more attractive options for delivering additional value to shareholders we will continue to deliver strong results make targeted growth investments trim underperforming businesses and further enhance returns to shareholders by resuming our share repurchase program " with few other acquisition targets in the aluminum space of such a size and scope alcoa is at a crossroads "they are stuck out there on their own " says john mothersole a metals analyst at global insight industry practice in washington d c "as an organization and as a company they do not fit into this big diversified model among the global players you wonder what is next for them " rios deal for alcan underscores the price competitors are willing to pay for producers of aluminum used world wide to make a range of things such as beverage cans and jetliners rios offer totals &# a share more than double the price alcans shares fetched at the beginning of the year also in big board trading alcan shares rose to &# related breakingviews column on page c one scenario proposed by industry analysts is that alcoa will hook up with australias bhp billiton ltd rios rival former alcoa chairman and chief executive paul oneill has acted as a special adviser and consultant for private equity firm blackstone group which some speculate could be a partner with bhp billiton for an alcoa buyout under that scenario bhp would keep the primary mining and metals divisions with blackstone taking the downstream noncore manufacturing assets such as packaging bhp declined to comment blackstone didnt return a call for comment another possible acquirer is brazils companhia vale do rio doce which is trying to diversify its predominantly iron ore portfolio with nickel and other metals mr belda spent much of his career managing alcoas assets in brazil cvrd officials said they had no comment standard and poors put its rating in rio on watch with negative implications rios chief executive mr albanese said the move to buy alcan underscores his belief that the commodity supercycle driven by china and expanded by india will continue to demand aluminum and bring profits for years to come "aluminum is an excellent business to be in the outlook is expected to be strong " he said noting china driving growth "if history is a guide well see demand from an increasingly urbanized india following a similar trajectory " alcan executives said the two companies have considered partnerships and mergers in past decades but always concluded they were better off on their own alcan chairman yves fortier said he politely declined a suggestion of a merger with rio before alcoa launched its hostile bid may alcan subsequently talked to other parties and warmed to a transaction with rio "its with a great deal of emotion i see alcan being overtaken by a foreign company i do have a lump in my throat that is the truth of the matter " said mr fortier "but the negotiations have come through and we are ending up with a marriage of reason " large western natural resource miners such as bhp billiton rio tinto xstrata plc and anglo american plc have continued to expand in the past four years as a commodity boom has lined their pockets with cash but even those companies are being challenged along with alcoa and alcan by mining and metal companies rising from emerging markets such as cvrd russian aluminum maker united co rusal and chinese aluminum maker chalco that has forced the western giants to expand even more and prowl for acquisitions executives at rusal which has ambitions to dethrone alcoa as the no aluminum company by output declined to comment on the activity in the aluminum industry rio and alcan hope to finalize the transaction in the fourth quarter of the year
