signs of hope for japans activists despite some investor defeats pressure remains on firms to return value two weeks ago some investors were mourning the "week of defeat" for activist shareholders in japan an unprecedented number of proposals to return money to investors were voted down at corporate annual meetings and a japanese court cleared a controversial takeover defense measure further hindering some holders in the view of analysts those developments would discourage investors from buying japanese stocks instead the stock market hit a seven year high this week the nikkei stock average ended at monday its highest close since may it has slipped a bit since closing down yesterday to investors looking for quick profits should take heed most analysts dont expect the index to shoot up anytime soon but they say there are good reasons to expect a steady rise so patience could pay off one reason many big japanese companies are relatively detached from the domestic economy where consumer spending is sluggish though gross domestic product the widest measure of goods and services is expected to rise this year much of this comes from big companies investing in plants and equipment exporters such as auto makers are reporting another year of record profits helped by a weak yen which makes japanese products more competitive in overseas markets and japans marine transport and trading companies are benefiting from continued strong growth in developing economies another thing the recent series of defeats for shareholder activists in japan are only the first of such battles analysts say activist shareholders main beef with japanese corporate management is that the executives sit on the cash earned by their listed companies rather than return enough money to investors as of june average return on equity a measure of how much profit a company generates with its assets was for japans market that compares with for the u s and in the united kingdom according to s&amp p citigroup world indices it calculated japans average dividend yield at that date as also less than in other major economies in response roughly shareholder resolutions were submitted during the countrys main week of stockholder general meetings according to nikko citigroup research that was about twice as many as last year most of the motions were seeking bigger dividend payouts and almost all were defeated separately last month steel partners japan strategic fund offshore lp a fund run by u s investors suffered a court defeat in its attempt to take over condiment maker bull dog sauce co steel partners sued bull dog alleging that the companys "poison pill" defense plan violated japanese law the takeover defense will dilute the funds holdings to less than from more than if used but the court said the defense was valid after other shareholders approved it during the past week u s private investment firm perry capital llc asked to buy part of nec corp s stake in its nec electronics corp unit some investors and analysts say that nec electronics whose board has only one member from outside nec could perform better if it was less dominated by its parent the semiconductor maker is in unprofitable businesses such as mobile phone components produced mainly for nec products but nec said it has no plans to sell any of its holding setting the stage for a possible showdown strategists say that these challenges are making japanese corporations increasingly conscious of the need to raise shareholder value in one recent example ono pharmaceutical co was challenged by a u s shareholder brandes investment partners to raise its dividend ono didnt do so but did produce a counter proposal to increase payouts to shareholders morgan stanley strategist naoki kamiyama says some smaller companies have started to take such moves autonomously in order to pre empt such requests from demanding shareholders "they have a sense of crisis now " he says "its not perfect" as a way to improve shareholder returns "but its clearly happening positively " another form of pressure comes from within the japanese business establishment which isnt seen as threatening in the way that foreign funds are japans pension fund association which represents corporate pension funds in june the pfa said it would vote against the re election of corporate board members if their company had posted a return on equity of less than for each of the past three years "recently corporate earnings have gotten better " says taku yamamoto the pfas chief fund manager "so if they dont pay higher dividends the money will just be kept in reserve inside the company " he says the move was part of a campaign to get better returns from corporations five years ago for example the pfa demanded that boards include at least one external director then a rarity in japan it has now become relatively common in the longer term the steady increase in foreign holdings of japanese companies will likely boost pressure to provide greater value to shareholders and that would be good news for investors in just of japanese shares by value were owned by foreigners now that is up to and patrick mohr a strategist at nikko citigroup says that in another year it will likely be or that he says means more of the kinds of questions that traditional japanese shareholders dont ask but foreigners do "the question arises whose cash is this on the balance sheet management thinks its theirs theyve built it up over years shareholders think that its theirs " mr mohr says
