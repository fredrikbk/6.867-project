gates aids trial failure stirs questions setback highlights rift over treatment versus prevention a &# million clinical trial funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation in africa showed that using diaphragms as a barrier to hiv failed to prevent infection in the latest in a growing list of disappointments in efforts to prevent aids the gates foundation has long given priority to funding efforts aimed at preventing the diseases spread rather than putting money into drug treatments for those already afflicted despite criticism from some in the field that money would be better spent on drugs the foundation argues that unless the diseases spread is slowed the tide of five million new infections a year will swamp the worlds treatment capacity but effective new prevention methods have eluded public health researchers in late january the field was stunned when a microbicide or virus blocking gel also backed by the gates foundation failed to work in a clinical trial "prevention research isnt a field for someone who wants a guaranteed slam dunk on the first try " said nicholas hellmann interim director hiv tb and reproductive health at the gates foundation "but well come up with new technologies that will work were going full steam ahead " the gates foundation has a &# million portfolio of prevention projects including providing access to proven tools such as condoms and funding research into new technologies such as vaccines and microbicides in the latest setback researchers found that volunteers using latex diaphragms along with condoms became infected about as often as those using condoms alone the annual rate of infection was about a year in the two year study of south african and zimbabwean women most of whom were married or in steady relationships the report by nancy padian leader of the international team of researchers on the study was published online in the journal lancet yesterday dr padian a professor of medicine at university of california san francisco has studied aids since the finding is most disappointing "for women who still cant negotiate condom use by men " dr padian said in an interview women urgently need methods of aids prevention they can control themselves commentators wrote in an opinion piece in the same issue of lancet in this first major randomized controlled trial of diaphragms as a preventative researchers had hoped the ortho all flex latex diaphragms used with lubricant would shield the cervix from hiv one problem was biological diaphragms leave the vagina exposed another was behavioral despite instructions to use dual protection the diaphragm users reported lower condom use by their partners of major randomized controlled trials to test different ways to prevent hiv transmission funded by a variety of sponsors studies showed no effect the report notes among recent trials only male circumcision and treating sexually transmitted infections seem to help prevent hiv infection using aids drugs during childbirth to prevent mother to baby transmission has also had promising results now condoms and abstinence programs are the main tools promoted for preventing hiv aids which affects nearly million people world wide until there is a vaccine which could be a decade away hopes are focused on increasing the practice of male circumcision in poor countries and on the continuing trial of gilead inc pills viread and truvada now being tested in africa asia the u s and latin america to see whether they can prevent hiv infection male circumcision has recently been shown to reduce risk to men by helping reduce the incidence of inflammations and lesions that increase vulnerability to the hiv virus among men in resource poor areas but circumcision faces cultural and religious barriers it also requires surgical sterility and weeks of post operative abstinence to avoid exacerbating risks of infection internationally health officials are still conferring on best practices for expanding opportunities for men at risk to become circumcised a potential prevention pill is tricky too due to concerns it might undermine other "safe sex" efforts scientists said separately in this weeks issue of the journal nature that the field of aids prevention cant afford more negative results "the microbicide field is drinking at the last chance saloon " john moore of the weill cornell medical college in new york said in an article in the issue addressing a dispute over the design of a new microbicide trial in south africa "if it has many more problems its finished " microbicides were the talk of an august aids conference in toronto where bill gates and bill clinton touted their promise but in january a gates funded trial of microbicide gel for women was pulled from study after an analysis found more women became infected while using it than a placebo it harked back to the failure years earlier of nonoxynol a spermicide that ended up increasing the risk of women contracting hiv because it inflamed cells of the reproductive tract accelerating infection other microbicide tests may yield results this year the negative results also raise broad questions about the design of prevention studies to be ethical to the participants trials must offer all volunteers condoms which have been shown shown effective in blocking hiv as well as the methods being tested but it is hard to tease out effects of the diaphragm or other tools from the effect of condoms finally prevention trials rely on sticking to a behavior change which is hard to enforce and test rates of condom and diaphragm usage couldnt be objectively confirmed by researchers who relied on statements of the volunteers themselves in seattle university of washington medical professor judith wasserheit said "i wouldnt characterize this as the last gasp in aids prevention " while not affiliated with the diaphragm study she serves as vice chair of the universitys new department of global health which is jointly funded by the gates foundation and washington state dr wasserheit said studies of new aids vaccines by merck &amp co and the national institutes of health are now starting to resuscitate some hope as have tests to see if treating herpes which involves lesions that increase vulnerability can help prevent aids infection and transmission even hope for diaphragms as a preventative isnt dead yet insists christopher elias president of path the seattle based non profit developing a diaphragm made of a lavender colored smooth silicone designed to be easy to use without requiring the fittings of traditional diaphragms "if you have one negative trial of an ulcer drug " dr elias reasons "you dont give up on ulcer drugs "
