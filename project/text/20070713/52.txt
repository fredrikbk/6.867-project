not recognizing someone you know can be painful i wish young duncan well with his "faceblindness" "mysteries of the faceblind could illuminate the brain " page one july i am legally blind as a result of service in vietnam and havent been able to see faces for years i ask people to please tell me who they are and i let them know that im not rude if i dont recognize them at first i think duncan will discover that people have a variety of abilities and he can assert his difficulty and then move on not letting people know i dont recognize their faces is much more frustrating than letting them know i would suggest to his parents to let him work it out with his peers it gets easier with time bruce rider grapevine texas
