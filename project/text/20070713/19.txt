dow again soars to record high despite unease fear of forgoing gains trumps bond worries more volatility expected the point surge that propelled the dow jones industrial average to an all time high its biggest one day gain in nearly four years continues a pattern of seemingly defiant bullishness by uneasy investors yesterdays buying spree like those that preceded it in turn generated more momentum by driving those with negative bets to reverse course to cut their losses all year the stock market has grappled with worrisome trends from concerns about the housing slump and energy costs hurting the economy to a february plunge in chinas stock market to more recent jitters when several banks balked at providing financing for huge takeover deals many money managers still expect the housing slump and mortgage market troubles to continue creating stock volatility this summer yet investors have shrugged off each bout of turmoil embracing positive signs and downplaying negative ones yesterday was no exception as a major deal rio tinto plcs planned purchase of canadian aluminum company alcan inc for about &# billion and better than expected retail sales figures set off an early rally as the day progressed some short term investors who had been betting on market declines unwound their bets buying stocks and adding to the markets strength it suggested investors continue to bet that the world economy is growing strongly enough to trump any problems along the way the dow industrials jumped points or to including points in the final hour of trading the biggest one day percent gain since october and the biggest point gain since october the blue chip average is up this year and has risen since july of last year in one day it broke through and levels it had never seen and now is knocking on the door of it beat its previous record of hit on june by more than points the standard &amp poors stock index also hit a record jumping or points to the nasdaq composite index heavy in technology stocks would have to nearly double to return to the record it hit in but it did hit a new six year high rising or points to the russell small stock index also hit a record rising to the days news calmed fears that bond market trouble could make it hard to finance corporate buyouts and while the chain store reports did show that gasoline prices and the housing slump have affected consumers shoppers didnt stay home from the mall as much as feared "all the recent issues surrounding subprime mortgages havent spilled over to consumer spending as shown by the chain store sales " said seth tobias of hedge fund circle t partners in new york "the consumer didnt wake up and say my god the mortgage securities market is imploding i cant go out shopping " optimists expect the gains to continue notwithstanding stocks volatility so far this year the dow industrials have posted gains or declines of or more on days seven of those since june the dow saw such days in all of last year bullish observers expect the market to keep rebounding due to the world economys mix of steady growth with low inflation and high employment although some think the years second half wont be as strong as the first but others are nervous about the gains which they believe have pushed risky investments such as developing country stocks and bonds to excessive levels there was an artificial aspect to yesterdays gain which was provoked in part by panic buying among fast money investors especially hedge funds they raced to unwind bearish investments once it became clear that the stock market was turning sharply higher the markets volume wasnt unusually high which would have been expected on a decisive day that signaled bigger gains to come these hedge fund investors had expected tuesdays selloff to continue and had thought consumer spending would be stifled more by the slowing economy they had sold stocks short notably those of retailers and financial companies borrowing the stocks and selling them in expectation that they would be able to buy them back more cheaply later when the market turned many such investors raced to unwind those bets and to do so they bought the stock back their purchases helped accelerate the stock gains retailers and financials were among the markets biggest winners including stocks such as american express co which had fallen on tuesday only to rebound yesterday other investors who had been holding money out of stocks in expectation of a further decline decided to jump in and buy so as not to be left behind "a lot of shorter term investors have been very cautious on the market and it got a bit too extreme " says steven goldman market strategist at brokerage firm weeden &amp co "there was a tremendous amount of shorting" of stocks bets that stock prices would fall traders point to short covering as a major reason for the rally consider intel corp a dow component for the past year roughly million shares of the microchip maker were sold short but that number began rising in april and hit million shares in mid june meaning more investors were betting the santa clara calif companys shares would fall intel shares jumped nearly yesterday and more than three million shares changed hands in the last two minutes of trading "you dont have moves like this in intel unless people are saying oh boy ive got to throw in the towel " a trader at a major mutual fund company said much of the short covering centered on retail stocks traders also said in recent months that hedge funds had been asking brokers to create customized baskets of stocks of retailers that they could short so they could make a bet that consumer spending would decline yesterday when strong retail sales numbers drove these shares higher many hedge funds covered their shorts indeed traders attributed much of the buying in the market to investors who either were being cautious and feared they were missing out on big gains or those who had been negative on the market to remedy the situation they bought or "went long" in stocks "the only guys who were getting more long today were the guys who were too short " a trader said investors have been struggling for weeks to figure out how much impact mortgage market troubles and rising bond yields would have on stock markets one fear was that lenders would pull back from riskier loans in general making it much more expensive for private investment funds to finance the multibillion dollar buyouts that have helped to support stock demand the fears worsened after tuesdays news that housing demand was continuing to erode and that bond rating agencies were cutting ratings on billions of dollars of low grade mortgage backed securities that made investors nervous and drove down the prices of stocks and even more so those of bonds and derivatives based on bonds in some markets traders feared a collapse was near but the markets held and yesterdays good news broke that fear the stock market also gained because even as investors worry about taking excessive risk they see the stock market as a relatively lower risk investment especially compared with the riskier parts of the bond market valuations are reasonable company balance sheets and earnings are solid and the global economy remains healthy "people want to see the glass as half full " says uri landesman a senior portfolio manager at ing investment management "this is a remarkable two day turnaround " mr landesman says he was heartened to see rio tinto take on a large acquisition even after the tremendous rally in commodities a sign that the mining company believes commodity demand can continue "if theyre willing to step up and spend that kind of coin at what normally would be considered the top of the market maybe its not the top of the market " bullish investors also pointed to weekly unemployment data out yesterday showing fewer people than expected filing new jobless claims "theres been only a gradual rate of slowdown in jobs if that " says bank of america economist peter kretzmer "fundamentally the consumer is not in far worse shape today than he or she was a year ago " but other wall street pros cautioned that yesterdays rally didnt necessarily signal that the stock market has forgotten about the bond market and high gasoline prices "we keep uncovering things finding out things that are wrong " says howard simons a strategist at bianco research in chicago
