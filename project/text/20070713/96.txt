weekend journal review theater summer camp xanadu helen hayes theatre w th st &# &# fables de la fontaine gerald w lynch theatre john jay college tenth ave &# &# closes sunday new york when drama critics with long memories get together to chew the fat they like to talk about the bad shows theyve seen not the run of the mill stinkers but the really really bad shows the ones so appalling that theyre tempted to slit their wrists at intermission in my experience most of these shows have been broadway musicals and prior to this week my list of contenders for the title of worst musical ive ever reviewed consisted of "in my life " "lestat " "lennon " "the times they are a changin" and "ring of fire " in that order then came "xanadu " whats so uniquely awful about this stage version of the flop that put an end to olivia newton johns hollywood career start with the fact that its an elephantine spoof of a quarter century old movie so terrible that few people saw it and fewer still remember it that strikes me as a pretty good working definition of pointlessness not to mention a near infallible recipe for boredom why bother making such elaborate fun of a forgotten film about a dopey freelance artist cheyenne jackson who is visited by a greek muse kerry butler who inspires him to open a roller disco pure spoofery cloys quickly even when its target is familiar and "xanadu" has nothing else to offer well not quite nothing the score consists of a string of mostly vapid but extremely well crafted tunes by john farrar and jeff lynne five of which hit the charts in and one of which "magic " is a first rate pop song which brings us to the second thing thats wrong with "xanadu" not only does douglas carter beanes flimsy book is a tissue of sniggeringly unfunny jokes about how silly the shows premise is but christopher ashley the director has staged the songs in a nudge nudge wink wink way that leaves you in no possible doubt of his contempt for them this gets old after about seconds but the show goes on for another hour and a half all of which i spent writhing impatiently in my seat somewhere along the way one of the characters in "xanadu" describes the onstage proceedings as "like childrens theater for year old gay people " thats putting it mildly "xanadu" is the gayest show to hit town since "the boys in the band " the trouble is that mr beane is the sort of gay playwright who deals exclusively in campy self mockery which is like serving a course dinner consisting solely of condiments with a great big dish of whipped cream for dessert if thats your kind of meal eat hearty the curtain went up an hour late on "fables de la fontaine " the first production of lincoln center festival a malfunctioning light board was to blame fortunately the show was more than worth the wait robert wilson whose slow motion surrealism put him on the avant garde map in the s has collaborated with the comedie francaise europes oldest theater company on a pantomime based french language version of of jean de la fontaines th century animal fables the result is a work of uncanny beauty and compulsion one of the most entrancing spectacles ever to be presented on a new york stage la fontaines fables are not unknown in this country marianne moore translated them to exquisite effect in but they have never been widely popular among english speaking readers in france by contrast they are universally known and loved not only by children but also by the adults for whom these worldly wise tales of human folly were originally written la fontaines barbed ironies have far more in common with la rochefoucauld than aesop and mr wilson is wholly in tune with their dark vision he has placed his gaily costumed actors in a bare postmodern box there to enact a sequence of laconic playlets whose bleak moral is that mens passions turn them into "slaves of themselves " nothing is sadder than the truth but even the saddest truths can be made palatable by being told with a smile and mr wilsons wonderful cast acts out these parables of disillusion with irresistible gusto aided by the witty costumes of moidele bickel and the brilliantly appropriate incidental music of michael galasso i cant imagine a more adorable poodle than francoise gillard or a slyer fox than laurent natrella but never does anyone least of all mr wilson himself settle for the too easy charm that is the curse of most such shows indeed he does without actors altogether in "the oak and the reed " in which an offstage narrator tells the tale of a haughty oak tree felled by a high wind mr wilson shows us only the slowly falling tree and a slender reed that bends in the breeze sketching the scene with the crisp economy of a japanese painter and leaving the rest to our imaginations i suspect that deceptively simple stage picture will be haunting my memory for a very long time to come mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
