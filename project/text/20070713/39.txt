loan slump may crimp buyout deals lackluster market is challenge for bankers pause that refreshes in a snag that is complicating the deal wave the market for risky bank loans which has stood strong even as other markets went through bouts of turmoil the past few years is hitting speed bumps prices of many corporate loans fell significantly over the past month meanwhile some new loan sales have been seeing lackluster demand from investors a potential challenge for the corporate buyout boom which many loans are helping to fund in addition to being a challenge to bankers the losses could be a surprise for small investors that own mutual funds specializing in bank loans as a conservative part of their portfolio returns on these so called leveraged loans fell to a month low in june according to standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data though the downturn isnt related to fundamental problems at companies that are responsible for the loans which are enjoying solid profits and low default rates it exemplifies the growing uncertainty in markets about the outlook "people always counted on the loan market being open when other markets were closed " says michael mcadams president of four corners capital management a fixed income manager in los angeles "but any market that tilts too much in one direction has to have a pullback this is the pause that refreshes and that helps things move forward again " yesterday loan prices recouped some of their recent losses as stocks rose and junk bonds rebounded but investors and bankers say concerns linger in a report to be released today fitch ratings says investor appetite for leveraged loans "is beginning to show signs of waning " and cites growing concerns over difficulties in other debt markets notably the u s mortgage market and the huge amount of debt fund raising being planned by companies it isnt clear if the loan market will be able to absorb more than &# billion in new issuance that is planned for the coming months over half of that will go toward funding buyouts such as cerberus capital managements purchase of a majority stake in daimlerchryslers chrysler group and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co s plan to buy first data corp last month several debt sales were postponed or banks were forced to finance deals from their own pockets because of turbulence in the market still many bankers say they expect to sell the large deals that are coming up the &# billion leveraged loan market is comprised of corporate loans whose credit ratings are below investment grade or "junk " they make up the bulk of lbo financings and are typically secured by hard assets of the companies that issue them which makes these loans safer than junk bonds which are often unsecured such loans used to be held almost exclusively by banks but are now often sold to investors much the same way that junk bonds are "you might call it a buyers strike " says daniel toscano head of loan syndication at deutsche bank in new york "but it is a market correction and not a credit downturn companies are still healthy " the ebb of this giant market whose main buyers include mutual funds insurance companies and managers of debt pools known as collateralized loan obligations is in some ways related to investor concerns over the troubles in the u s housing market unlike subprime borrowers most corporations arent having problems servicing their debt however as with mortgage underwriting standards corporate loan underwriting standards have deteriorated significantly over the past two years with banks selling investors loans with few or no covenants private equity firms are also pushing companies to take on what some investors see as excessive debt loads "weve had a lively discussion over contagion trying to figure out whats drawing these two effectively unrelated markets together " says john addeo a high yield fund manager at mfs investments "maybe its just an aversion to risk " last month the near collapse of two hedge funds managed by bear stearns rattled the corporate debt market the funds made big bets on subprime mortgage backed securities but also held some clos which were offered for sale as the hedge funds assets were being liquidated it isnt clear if the clos were actually sold but the prospect of a fire sale spooked some investors and made them reassess their appetite for riskier corporate debt also playing a role was an index that tracks prices in this market known as the lcdx it was launched in late may by a company called markit group since the bear funds problems came to light that index fell from to a low of on wednesday before rebounding to yesterday afternoon the fall in the index then translated into declines in the prices of many individual loans "i dont think anybody saw this particular impact coming " says thomas ewald portfolio manager on the aim floating rate fund though the markets are obscure to many the events are affecting individual investors mutual funds that invest in bank loans have in recent years gained favor as a conservative element in many investor portfolios bank loan funds hold &# billion in assets according to morningstar inc in the past month the average bank loan mutual fund is down according to morningstar data that may not seem like much but since late the average bank loan fund has posted gains in every month except one morningstar says "for the market to be off like this is surprising people " says joseph welsh a portfolio manager on the oppenheimer senior floating rate fund "its a big deal " the steady returns of leveraged loans and the consistent profits for managers of loan portfolios over the years led to sometimes indiscriminate buying that enabled issuers to come to market with loans that paid lower and lower interest rates and also had fewer protections for investors the dynamic might be changing first came a building list of low quality debt to be issued to finance highly leveraged corporate buyouts investors like pension funds hedge funds and insurance firms meanwhile began requiring higher yields before they would own riskier pieces of clos making it harder for clo managers to profit that caution has in turn made managers more conscious of the quality of loans they purchase some &# billion of clos were issued in the u s during the first half above last years pace but monthly issuance has slipped since february and is expected to slow in the second half according to s&amp p leveraged commentary &amp data s&amp p cuts subprimes fitch plans downgrades standard &amp poors lowered
