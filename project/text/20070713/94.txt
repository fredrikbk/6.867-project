weekend journal review film bleak brooding harry potter is short on nuance a perfunctory feel cheadle cant save dutiful talk to me with the publication of the seventh and final installment of the harry potter series on july somebodys hash will be settled at long last until then fans will have to settle for the appropriately bleak if fragmented and perfunctory movie version of book five with year old harry daniel radcliffe a wizard at odds with his world though he does manage to snag his first kiss this includes the staunchly conservative ministry of magic the wizards governing body which almost expels harry from hogwarts boarding school for a supposed infraction and the wizarding world rag "the daily prophet " which scoffs at harrys story of a recent encounter with evil lord voldemort ralph fiennes this also includes a sadistic new teacher imelda staunton whos got a bead on harry and myriad classmates who pooh pooh his belief that the dark forces are regaining strength even hogwarts headmaster albus dumbledore michael gambon harrys longtime protector and mentor has become mysteriously distant his boon companions hermione emma watson and ron rupert grint his fey new friend luna the wonderful evanna lynch and godfather sirius black gary oldman offer some succor still this is increasingly the portrait of a wizard as an alienated young man the movies palette almost limited to gray and black adds to the sense of unease and foreboding director david yates who is new to the potter franchise moves the story along briskly at the expense of texture and nuance in any case despite its title the movie belongs to ms staunton as the poisonous in pink dolores umbridge a fascistic functionary from the ministry of magic who becomes acting head of hogwarts and who likes children just exactly the way w c fields did fried talk to me watching "talk to me " its difficult not to wonder what its subject ralph waldo "petey" greene jr would make of the proceedings greene a former convict who became a hugely popular radio personality a community activist and a hero in the washington d c black community during the late s and early s was known for his endless insistence on "telling it like it is " this stance would require an admission that however well intentioned however sedulously it touches all the bio pic bases and honors certain basic bio pic tropes changing times and attitudes are signified by alterations in coiffures and in characters accumulation of facial hair "talk to me" rarely rises above the dutiful in all instances the lift is supplied by the wonderful don cheadle as petey dewey hughes chiwetel ejiofor the very strait laced program director at radio station wol am is visiting his brother in prison when he meets the intense importunate greene whos doing time for armed robbery and who boasts of his dj ing prowess as hell say later its the only job he can do without breaking the law dewey contemptuously carelessly tells greene to come and see him when hes out of the clink never dreaming greene will do exactly that when petey shows up "im here to work in this funky joint" hes summarily shown the door but confronted by a sharp drop in ratings for the morning drive time broadcast dewey convinces the dubious station head martin sheen in a thankless role to give petey a chance his first stint in the booth is almost his last his second brings out the police but the phone lines start lighting up like christmas trees and dewey becomes convinced that peteys fresh mouth is a breath of fresh air temperaments collide while nominally a snapshot of a fraught period in the countrys history just before and after the assassination of martin luther king jr "talk to me" is at bottom the story of the relationship between dewey and petey its a collision course given the vast differences in their temperaments and dreams but those differences however genuine are exploited to give the film a tension it wouldnt otherwise have for a movie that celebrates the power of speech "talk to me" is oddly tongue tied its dialogue equal parts uptight honky and jumping jive seems particularly in the early stretches to have been generated by a computer interview they may not be willing to cop to it but journalists know that an interview is as much as anything a seduction you show me yours ill show you mine that is to say ill pretend to show you mine but whos seducing who thats the signal concern of the diverting if ultimately inconsequential "interview " based on the film of the same name by dutch filmmaker theo van gogh who was murdered in by a muslim extremist steve buscemi directed and co wrote this adaptation which could just as easily be called "sex lies and videotape " he also plays pierre a political and war reporter who is none too pleased with his current assignment a profile of katya the ravishing sienna miller a blond starlet whose movies the latest is "killer body parts iv" hes never seen whose hit tv show hes never watched and whose i q you know hes thinking compares unfavorably with her bust measurement katya shows up an hour late at the designated meeting place a restaurant of the moment where buscemi as filmmaker wonderfully exposes a celebritys hollow efforts to establish "im just like you" bona fides the interview lets just say does not go well katyas amour propre is abraded by pierres lack of preparedness pierre makes no secret of his boredom and his desire to be gone taxi but katya indirectly responsible when pierre gets a bit dinged in a traffic accident invites him to her loft to dress the wound and redress the wrongs of their previous encounter "you can ask me anything anything at all " she says hmmmm over the course of the evening the two drink and talk engage in sexual sparring and lay bare what they claim to be their darkest secrets comic relief is provided by the dog bark ring tone of katyas cell phone both in its content and production values "interview" has the feel of an undergraduate project all intensity no never mind pierre is such a weasel katya is such a narcissist and the outcome seems so pre determined its hard to care whose belt gets the notch the adroit performances of buscemi and miller almost make it matter dvd tip a bespectacled year old daniel radcliffe learns the truth hes a great and powerful wizard in the movie that began it all the over reverent but richly detailed "harry potter and the sorcerers stone " joe morgenstern is on vacation
