kodaks new printer is a good start plus it cuts the cost of ink as part of its long rocky journey from film to digital photography kodak just introduced a line of home inkjet printers the company has decided to go after its rival hewlett packard which dominates consumer inkjet printing kodaks main weapon in this new war is cheaper ink traditionally h p and other makers have sold the printers for relatively little then made most or all of their money on the ink cartridges so kodak decided to reverse that business model its three new printers start at &# not sub &# bargain prices but its black ink cartridges cost just &# and the color ones which combine five color inks just &# and these are standard capacity cartridges not small or starter versions comparable h p cartridges vary in price but can easily cost double that or more kodak hopes consumers will be willing to spend more upfront for the printer to save later on the ink in a counter move h p announced tuesday that it will also be introducing new lower price cartridges but these new low end cartridges will work only on future printers and a few very recent models and they will hold less ink than todays standard plus they will still cost more than kodaks cartridges &# for black and &# for the combined color versions h p will also start selling larger capacity "value" cartridges for the new printers that will cost about twice as much as the low end ink but print up to triple the number of pages how good are kodaks new printers after all cheaper ink isnt really a bargain if the printer is lousy to find out ive been testing kodaks midrange model the easyshare which costs &# its an "all in one" machine that combines a printer with a flatbed copier and scanner i compared this new kodak with a roughly comparable all in one h p model the photosmart c this particular h p model costs &# more than the kodak because it includes some additional features but h p says that this printer has the same printing scanning and copying quality and speeds in the typical scenarios i tested as h ps c the direct competitor of the kodak which costs the same my conclusion was that the kodak easyshare is a pretty good printer with a good enough combination of quality speed and functionality to satisfy people attracted by the lower ink costs in my tests it was better than the h p at some things and worse at others one caveat i didnt try to verify kodaks claim that overall its printouts cost a lot less than h ps such claims depend on very specific sorts of test files produced and tested in labs h p disputes kodaks testing methodology and claims that kodaks printout costs are "about the same or only slightly lower than h ps " also the particular h p models with which the kodak printers most closely compare use a different ink system than most other h p home inkjet printers instead of using one combined color cartridge that can cost over &# they use five smaller separate ones that cost &# each i decided to avoid settling this technical dispute and to just judge the printers using home photos and text pages from microsoft office that i considered typical i used both printers at normal quality levels and didnt enable any special quality or speed settings i tested them with a windows xp computer though both printers also work with macs and with the new windows vista in general the h p was a little faster but not dramatically so and the h p has built in networking while the kodak doesnt the h p also has a better user interface in my opinion kodaks can be clumsy but the kodak has a cool scanning feature the h p lacks you can place three or four photos on its glass plate at once and the printer will separate them automatically into individual images and scan them as separate files as long as they arent aligned too crookedly to do this on the h p you must manually draw lines around each photo with the h p software when i compared plain paper printouts in black and white and color the printers were about equal in quality the h p was a tad faster but the kodak was plenty quick on photos i had a mixed result the x snapshots of family scenes came out better to my eye on the kodak they seemed sharper and brighter than the same files printed on the h p but i had just the opposite result when scanning several year old photos into the two machines the resulting files produced by the h p seemed sharper and brighter the kodak scans while warmer seemed fuzzier the worst feature of the kodak is the way it switches between its plain paper feed tray and its special separate tray for x snapshot size photo paper on the kodak you must manually push in and pull out the photo tray to switch between types of paper the h p handles this switch without any pushing or pulling overall however the kodak is a good enough first effort to get the company into the game email me at mossberg wsj com see video versions of my reviews at wsj com mossbergvideo by walter s mossberg
