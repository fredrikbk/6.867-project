existing products offered in new colors adds rachael mcfarland mintels u s cosmetic analyst to differentiate themselves cosmetic companies increasingly are offering free makeover sessions in retail stores to help women sort out the product choices to find out if such advice is useful or merely a sales pitch in disguise we tested the expertise of five makeup artists at lancome mac sephora shu uemura and bobbi brown in new york city with each we stressed the importance of an easy but fast beauty routine for a time pressed mom as well as a desire for a look that was natural and fresh for spring all came up with looks in half hour sessions that were easy to replicate still while we walked away with some cool products and learned a few tricks we suffered a nagging sense of buyers remorse in the next days light not all of the products were worth it with no appointment we waited a half hour for a makeup artist at beauty chain sephora and received a minute session the "five minute" routine she came up with was doable using products we were already comfortable with like foundation blush and mascara convinced by her pitch that products like cargo onebase concealer &# would save us time because it could double as a foundation we bought most everything that was used in the session too bad the i d s bare essentials powder &# and two powdered eye shadows &# each she recommended proved cumbersome to use and not travel worthy and as a result are gathering dust in our medicine cabinet at saks fifth avenue after being turned away by a mac makeup artist we were steered to a lancome representative who was available for walk in after listening to our hope for a fast and simple routine he assembled what he deemed were the essentials foundation cover up mascara blush two eye shadows and lipstick in between the compliments and banter the artist answered our questions and showed us tricks to cut down on mirror time like applying eye makeup first to avoid the need to redo cover up and foundation while we werent won over by the foundation and cover up the look was too heavy we were persuaded to buy after some reassurance the mauve lipstick &# and blush &# we should have followed our gut we ended up giving away the lipstick and blush to our baby sitter because it ultimately wasnt flattering we gave mac another try this time at the henri bendel store the mac artist asked what we used and what we wanted to achieve in a brisk professional manner she did our eyes in shimmery beige and a coppery taupe &# each before sponging on foundation and cover up she claimed it was easier this way to clean up eye makeup flakes but the lesson wasnt all about basics she showed us springs hot look for lips a strong red glossy mouth after we asked for it at the end of the half hour session she went over all the products again while the end result was polished it was surprisingly normal even staid still we stepped up to the cash register with a pink lipstick gloss lip balm and one eye shadow the place that best lived up to all our demands for a fast easy routine and a new look for spring was at a retail store of shu uemura a japanese brand founded by makeup artist shu uemura the makeup artist showed us the best time saving product weve seen a foundation with spf that doubles as a powder &# then she opened our eyes to the flattering power of light lavender eye shadow &# a midnight blue eye liner &# that could replace mascara and a shimmery nude lipstick &# she made a point to tout the benefits of each product but the final result made us feel like a new person persuading us to take out our credit card we felt even better about dropping &# when she filled our bags with lots of samples the next day the only regret we had was the eye liner weve lived without eye liner for most of our lives because it smears shu uemuras proved no different bobbi browns makeup counters at bloomingdales was bustling when we visited a makeup artist in the upstairs studio was between appointments so we were able to have a lesson without a reservation after stressing our need for a simple routine we were introduced to a tinted moisturizer a mascara that she said could only be removed by bobbi browns eye makeup remover solution &# and the pot rouge &# which could be used on lips and cheeks after lightly proclaiming the wow factor of each product our rep as all of bobbi browns makeup artists do filled out a client sheet that not only named each product used but also contained actual smudges of each item in an effort to close to the deal still it was easy to stay firm we only bought what she told us would not smudge write cranky wsj com
