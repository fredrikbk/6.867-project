the daily fix ill timed sarcastic gesture costs warriors against mavs online edition has the nbas crackdown on player griping gone too far baron davis the hero of the golden state warriors upset of the dallas mavericks in game of their first round western conference playoff series was thrown out of game near the end of the third quarter his crime sarcastic applause that irked ref bennett salvatore the warriors trailed by points at that point and without their star they went on to lose "the bothersome part about all this and its been a problem since the start of the season is the nbas almost paranoid reaction to controversy " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "all of a sudden players couldnt conspicuously gripe about calls without the risk of ejection at first there seemed to be a double standard star players being allowed to vent a little but now its miss manners time for everybody " mr jenkins adds "it cant be long before a dirty look sends you straight to the locker room " fort worth star telegram columnist gil lebreton says mr salvatore had burned dallas with his "fickle whistle" in last years nba finals when the miami heat benefited from several controversial salvatore calls "cant this guy referee an nba playoff game without interjecting himself into the outcome " mr lebreton asks of course even with mr davis on the court the warriors didnt look like they had much of a chance to extend their inexplicable winning streak over dallas to seven games for the most part the mavs were back to their usual defensive dominance but dallas morning news columnist kevin sherrington frets that dirk nowitzki has slipped from the dominant form that likely earned him the league mvp award "this team is going to need him in the days and weeks to come if indeed the mavs are going to get out of the first round " mr sherrington writes "you cant always count on the other teams best guy to blow his cool " nor can you always count on the other teams best guy to underperform as lebron james has done in both of the cleveland cavaliers games in their series against washington nonetheless the cavs are up after last nights victory over the undermanned wizards "washingtons five at one point was brendan haywood antonio daniels roger mason michael ruffin and darius songaila " mike wise writes in the washington post "never mind an nba playoff game its hard to win summer league runs with that lineup " meanwhile the denver nuggets continued to follow their script from their first round matchup against the san antonio spurs two years ago losing game by a score of to head home with the series tied at last time around the spurs went on to win the series in five with manu ginobili emerging as the star this year there have been few signs of vintage ginobili play "hes been just another guy hidden by tim duncan and carmelo anthony and allen iverson " buck harvey writes in the san antonio express news "ginobili was also just another argentine on wednesday with fab oberto leading the spurs in rebounding but there was a telling stretch that started late in the third quarter then the ginobili of appeared and when denver closed within four points in the final minute with both the spurs and the crowd nervous ginobili forced his way through a handful of nuggets just as he did two years ago if the spurs are to repeat what they did in denver in they will need that ginobili " for the buffalo sabres who surprisingly came within one game of the stanley cup finals last season the joy of hockey appeared missing in round one of the playoffs against the new york islanders installed this time as favorites with the best record in the east the sabres appeared tight to buffalo news columnist bucky gleason "the sabres purity was their most charming quality last season as they marched into the eastern conference finals " mr gleason writes "ill never forget the morning of game seven against carolina when paul gaustad was screaming at the television while cheering for the contestants in the national spelling bee the sabres were just a bunch of kids playing hockey oblivious to the pressurized world around them at some point their innocence was stolen they had become acutely aware of their potential " but that old joy appeared to have returned last night in their series opening victory last night against the new york rangers each win brings buffalo closer to its first ever major championship before the playoffs began si coms richard deitsch offered a poignant look at the heartbreak and hope that typifies buffalos legion of sports fans two years ago liverpool edged chelsea in a champions league semifinal and went on to win the european club competition with a stunning comeback against milan in last nights rematch of the two england clubs chelsea took the upper hand with a home win next week liverpool gets a chance to reverse that score at its home grounds much has been made of the personality contrast between the two managers ably summarized by simon barnes in the times of london "jose mourinho portuguese manager of chelsea is permanently preposterous rafael benitez spanish manager of liverpool is perpetually plausible " but mr barnes goes on to write that its all overstated "the managers made much of their differences in the build up to this match but in the end they both sent out their english hearted defence dominated sides and we set out to see if they would cancel each other out quite as effectively as they did two years ago when a single goal separated the sides over two legs at the same stage of the same competition " also next week ac milan gets manchester united at home after falling to the semifinals third english team on tuesday floyd landis suffered a setback in his quest to defend his name and the legitimacy of his tour de france victory last year as new test results suggested the presence of synthetic testosterone in a urine sample collected during the tour the problem is the tests were conducted by the same lab that mr landis says has repeatedly engaged in sloppy science "landis is a bad messenger and he may well be indefensible " sally jenkins writes in the washington post "its entirely possible that the man charging the doping system with corruption is guilty of it himself but that doesnt mean his message is without merit " alan ball a hero of englands last world cup victory in has died at age of an apparent heart attack "in our collective mind ball is forever locked in one moment " jim white writes in the daily telegraph "it is the july wembley stadium and the world cup final there he is in all our mental newsreels tearing down englands right wing hair aflame passion ablaze his determination so intense it seems to singe the turf at his feet " his link to that great moment was a source of glory and a burden "at the age of he was the baby of the team on the mountain top but for the years that followed the place would never again be accessible " james lawton writes in the independent "it made him rather like some dislocated war hero who finds when the drama is done that he has to live out the rest of his life on another plane of less heightened experience a prisoner of both time and old glory " yet mr ball did have a successful professional career including memorable stints with everton and arsenal this highlight reel of his arsenal goals on
