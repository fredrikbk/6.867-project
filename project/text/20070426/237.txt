unwanted suitor raises the stakes in fight for abn rbs led group makes &# billion proposal holders apply pressure a bidding battle has broken out in what will be the worlds largest banking takeover with four of europes biggest banks in a two way contest to acquire abn amro holding nv of the netherlands the battle which began just this week already involves some of the most aggressive deal making tactics seen in years yesterday abn which had agreed to be acquired by british bank barclays plc for &# billion in stock received an unwelcome &# billion takeover approach from a consortium led by royal bank of scotland group plc but to pull off a deal the rbs group would need to break up two existing takeover agreements abns pact to be sold to barclays and abns unusual side deal to sell its chicago based lasalle bank unit to bank of america corp for &# billion in cash the rbs group said its proposed offer which would be paid in cash and with rbs shares was conditioned on abn finding a way to keep lasalle bank which has become a flashpoint in the takeover battle despite these hurdles no one is counting out rbs with a market value of about &# billion it is bigger than barclays or abn which each have a value of around &# billion rbs also has a history of audacious deal making including its victory over rival bank of scotland in a takeover battle for national westminster one of britains biggest banks the rbs groups takeover proposal is valued at about more than abns deal with barclays and abns shareholders including hedge funds that bought shares once the bank disclosed it was for sale several weeks ago are starting to mobilize to try to force abn to seek the highest possible price late last night london time abn said it would provide the consortium with the same financial details of its operations as it had provided to barclays amid growing shareholder demands that it do so rbs chief executive fred goodwin said earlier in the day that if given such access he would be able to move quickly with a formal bid rbs declined to disclose how it would fund an offer abn chief executive rijkman groenink settled on a friendly takeover deal with barclays largely because it agreed to his insistence that the sprawling year old dutch bank not be broken up barclays promised to keep most of abn creating a european banking giant by contrast rbs and its two allies banco santander central hispano sa of spain and dutch belgian bank fortis nv want to dismantle abn piece by piece selling some units the trio dont want to other buyers in an effort to protect his friendly agreement with barclays mr groenink agreed to sell lasalle bank to bank of america at a price above abns own estimate of the units value that deal was structured to put a sought after asset out of reach to discourage hostile bidders like rbs last night abns mr groenink held a meeting by phone with the three ceos from the rbs led group but little progress was made in resolving the two sides differences according to people briefed on the conversation the chance to acquire lasalle bank is a key reason why rbs is interested in abn and it and many abn shareholders are crying foul at the unusually stringent contract abn and bank of america signed to ensure the lasalle deal goes through time is crucial because abns deal to sell lasalle becomes permanent after may in evaluating a takeover abn says it must as required under dutch corporate guidelines consider issues beyond getting the highest price for shareholders such as how its employees customers and other stakeholders are treated and the banks position in the netherlands that argument may have worked in the past in continental europe but today pressure from investors which increasingly include hedge funds and other high powered institutions are putting companies under greater pressure than ever for maximum returns the childrens investment fund management known as tci one of londons largest hedge funds and holder of just under of abns shares has called on the banks board to be open to a higher bid and has said that the lasalle deal should be scrapped on sunday abn debated internally until just hours before announcing the lasalle bank deal whether it had to allow shareholders a separate vote on the sale it ultimately decided no vote would be required people familiar with the matter said under the rbs groups plan to divvy up abns global businesses rbs which is based in edinburgh scotland would acquire lasalle bank and abns london based wholesale and investment banking division according to people familiar with the matter it hopes to merge lasalle bank into its own growing u s banking franchise the abn unit has retail locations and atms in chicago and its suburbs it also has commercial operations in states and cities across the u s the plan also calls for banco santander to acquire abns banco real in brazil and other latin american divisions in addition to banca antonveneta spa of italy and other italian assets fortis would assume the dutch banking franchise first however the rbs group would have to mount a successful challenge to the lasalle bank deal one option would be for the group to bid for lasalle first but make that bid conditional on acquiring the rest of abn such a strategy would require abns support however because its contract with bank of america says abn can accept a rival bid for lasalle if it is better for all abn shareholders rbs could argue that because it would be bidding for all of abn at a higher price than the barclays deal any bid for lasalle would be better for all abn shareholders even if the bid was lower than bank of americas late tuesday night under pressure from shareholders abn released the full contract of its lasalle agreement many lawyers bankers and hedge fund managers stayed up poring through the page document looking for loopholes that could allow abn to terminate the lasalle sale yesterday abn and bank of america executives said that the strict wording of their sales contract meant the deal couldnt be unwound "there is no way that we can see" to break it said abn management board member huibert boumeester in an interview bank of america chairman and chief executive kenneth d lewis told shareholders that his company was going full steam ahead with its plan to acquire lasalle mr lewis was encouraged when rbs didnt immediately file a court challenge to bank of americas contract an executive close to him said another executive added that mr lewis would be reluctant to raise his bid but also reluctant to lose the chicago bank abns mr groenink in a statement yesterday said the only way the consortium could get lasalle is by making two bids one for lasalle and another for the rest of the bank "everyone should realize that this is actually a very good structure for shareholders as it maximizes the price we get for lasalle as well as for the rest of the group " he said but shareholders didnt see it that way "you cannot create poison pills and at the same time tell people that you are open to other offers we always hope that a deal will be friendly but rbs has a good track record in integrating hostile acquisitions " said tom shrager a director at tweedy browne co which holds about in abn stock at toscafund asset management llp a london hedge fund that owns about of abn chairman george mathewson who preceded mr goodwin as ceo of rbs also wants abn to go with rbs "i think its a great deal for rbs and i think its a great deal for abn amro shareholders " he said yesterday at rbss annual meeting in edinburgh "im very supportive of the bid " another avenue for challenging the deal would be for shareholders to sue abn management and supervisory board in court claiming they didnt do their fiduciary duty in securing the best offer for shareholders activist hedge fund tci was preparing filings yesterday as of yesterday however no cases had been filed in the dutch enterprise court in amsterdam which presides over corporate disputes valerie bauerlein in charlotte n c contributed to this article
