posh retailers pile on perks for top customers hey big spenders luxury retailers are going to new lengths to secure your loyalty this week nordstrom inc rolled out a "tiered" rewards program giving shoppers a chance to earn perks such as free shipping specially packaged trips to places like san francisco and miami and access to "red carpet" events and store openings if they spend enough on their nordstrom card at the store in the past nordstrom rewarded them only with points toward less glamorous spending credits known as nordstrom notes rivals are ramping up their loyalty programs too last fall saks inc s saks fifth avenue introduced a saks world elite mastercard which lets shoppers earn points on dollars spent outside the store toward benefits such as free fur storage and dinner at the captains table on a luxury cruise line neiman marcus group inc s neiman marcus this year is offering its incircle rewards participants the chance to buy a limited edition lexus car with five million points its also testing a credit card that lets shoppers earn points on dollars spent outside neiman stores both stores aim to broaden the appeal of their programs for shoppers its easier to rack up points on a card that can be used anywhere than on a traditional store card the offers reflect a growing emphasis by luxury retailers on getting a "greater share of wallet" from their or top spenders rather than trying to attract new customers with department stores overall losing market share their goal is to increase the profits generated by their best customers at neiman marcus for instance the top customers each spend more than &# a year at the store while other shoppers spend an average of about &# a year there according to customer growth partners a consulting firm despite the glamorous perks these programs carry some downsides for shoppers in many programs including those of nordstrom and barneys new york a shoppers level of rewards is based on spending in a calendar year meaning you have to re qualify all over again in january also some loyalty programs let you redeem points only once a year generally the stores automatically convert points into gift cards or spending certificates and send them to customers at the end of the year although a few will send them more often than that if requested bloomingdales issues them monthly as earned the new rewards programs up the ante for such customers particularly at the highest spending levels nordstrom for instance has long used a single formula to dole out points for everyone shoppers got one point for every dollar spent outside of nordstrom on one of the retailers cards which include visa cards and two points for each dollar spent at a nordstrom store while it still offers points toward nordstrom notes the retailer hopes shoppers will see the extra rewards offered at higher tiers as an incentive to spend more in neimans incircle program which has different tiers and a top tier of five million points shoppers usually get one point for each dollar they spend but at the highest tiers the point earning formulas are more generous neiman tweaks the rewards which include trips cars and designer clothing every year to keep them fresh the "rewards issue" of the programs glossy entree magazine recently featured a model in a russian red fox stole from fur designer pologeorgis on its cover described as a &# value free to those who earn and redeem incircle points at the end of each year neiman sends reminders that spending more can help shoppers qualify for better benefits last year neiman which has long taken only its own card and american express cards at its stores expanded its loyalty program to include spending at sister store bergdorf goodman the programs can pay off for retailers at neiman marcus the more than shoppers in its in circle loyalty program spent &# billion last year accounting for almost half of its business "the firepower of these customers is incredible " says neiman ceo burt tansky both membership and average spending per participant are growing neiman says membership in the top two of bloomingdales three rewards tiers has grown by in the past months says frank berman vice president of marketing the stores strategy is "take care of your best people they are worth more than acquiring twenty new ones " he says robin hopkins of alexandria ala acknowledges spending a little more to move up to a higher tier in rewards programs the year old mother of two who works part time participates in a number of rewards programs including incircle from neiman marcus but she says "i am not a &# spender if i really wanted to get something in particular i would just buy it " rather than trying to earn it through a retailers reward program to get started at most retailers you have to apply for one of the stores credit cards which often have interest rates of or more an awful deal if youre not paying off the balance in full nordstrom is an exception in that it offers points for spending on nordstrom debit and check cards as well other things to keep in mind in some instances the so called rewards arent free but rather discounts on travel packages or other offers for instance bloomingdales offers a three day spa trip to its insiders at a cost of &# per person which it describes as a discount off the trips regular price nordstrom restructured its program following six months of focus group study and surveys its conclusion people are less interested in discounts and more interested in perks such as attending nordstrom grand opening celebrations being pampered during private shopping parties concierge services and free alterations and shipping still neiman saks and other retailers say gift cards remain the most popular reward redeemed barneys new york a unit of jones apparel group inc shuns trips merchandise and other fancy rewards and simply sends out gift cards based on point levels for retailers the programs can be costly to operate milton pedraza chief executive of the luxury institute a consulting firm questions whether in the long run they make more sense for the stores than the traditional perks such as personalized service for the best customers even so he says his wife participates in the neimans incircle program and notes that it "definitely makes her more loyal to neiman for online purchasing in particular " robin sidel
