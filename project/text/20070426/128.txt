lucky dow hits record why market strength and economic growth dont always line up the stock market has been a lousy barometer of the economy from the beginning of through the first quarter of economic growth averaged an impressive the dow jones industrial average rose just since then economic growth has slowed to a little more than yet the blue chip index has leapt ending yesterdays session at a record the first time it has closed above so is the stock market providing reassurance or is it out of touch economists differ david rosenberg chief north american economist at merrill lynch &amp co thinks the market is misleadingly optimistic he says there is a "disconnect between how the economy is doing and the way the equity market is doing " the u s economy has just completed four quarters of annualized growth below which he says has never happened in years without being followed by recession while he doesnt forecast one he puts the risks higher than generally realized but ed hyman chief economist at isi group a new york investment dealer says the market has it right just as in and the federal reserve has raised interest rates enough to slow the economy and bring inflation under control that reassures investors that even higher rates wont be needed later that could tip the economy into recession mr hyman expects economic growth to slow further to an annual rate of in the last nine months of this year and the fed to cut short term interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point the boost to stocks from lower rates should more than offset the drag from weaker growth and profits he says at present the stock market isnt responding to recent profit growth in fact profit growth has fallen sharply and the outlook is clouded by slowing u s productivity growth high fuel prices and the specter of protectionism that could interrupt the pace of globalization which has boosted u s companies profits from overseas rather the rally that began last summer has been principally driven by the feds decision to stop raising interest rates the stock market has long been regarded as a leading economic indicator though it sometimes sends the wrong signals it reflects the collective judgment of millions of investors on the prospects for corporate profits which are highly sensitive to economic fluctuations however other things also affect stocks interest rates the flow of money into and out of shares and investors appetite for risk that is why experts often disagree on how to interpret the market mr hyman of isi says the popular view that a strong stock market requires a strong economy is "just totally wrong " beginning in the early s he says the fed adopted the practice of raising rates ahead of anticipated inflation pressure often early in an expansion such "pre emptive" tightenings slowed growth but prevented an outbreak of higher inflation during the tightening phase stocks struggled to advance even though profits were usually growing as investors fretted the fed would go too far and tip the economy into recession once the central bank stopped raising rates investors concluded that with inflation under control a recession was unlikely and stocks took off again the fed didnt always succeed its tightenings were followed by recession in and in still mr hyman points to the united kingdom australia and canada which have grown without interruption since the early s as proof that long expansions are likely as long as inflation stays tame "it appears we are still in the tame inflation mode " he says merrills mr rosenberg in contrast says the s and s were the exception and sees no special factors that will extend the current expansion the way tax cuts and internet mania did in the two previous expansions the conference boards index of leading indicators has declined on a year to year basis for three consecutive months that is in spite of the rise in the stock market which is one of the indexs components mr rosenberg says every time it has done that in the past five decades a recession followed with one exception among the components of the index recently pointing to a risk of recession are capital goods orders building permits and the fact that short term interest rates are higher than long term rates there also are other signs that the economic expansion is showing its age one that former fed chairman alan greenspan has called attention to is profit margins on an economy wide basis they hit a record high in the third quarter of last year before narrowing slightly in the fourth period mr greenspans view is that the s and s expansions were helped both by a decline in long term interest rates as investors adjusted to a low inflation world and a surprise acceleration in productivity growth in the s driven by information technology neither factor is at work now but steven wieting an economist at citigroup inc says stocks have persistently lagged behind the growth in profits since the end of he figures investors are anticipating economic growth over the long term of just to that is below many economists estimates that the u s economy can grow at about a year on average over time "the market from a long term context isnt expecting a great deal out of the u s economy " he says see related article "wednesdays markets skeptics may shriek but earnings gains send stocks to a high" wsj april
