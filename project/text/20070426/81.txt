gifts to doctors are widespread free meals drugs are often accepted new survey finds a survey of more than physicians found that nearly all of them accepted free meals drugs or travel reimbursement from pharmaceutical or medical device manufacturers experts say the cozy ties between industry and the medical profession are troubling and that at least for now there is little that patients can do to uncover them unlike other professionals physicians arent bound by financial disclosure laws in most states "unfortunately as things stand its going to be up to doctors to clean up their act " said david rothman president of the institute on medicine as a profession a nonprofit ethical practices organization which funded the research which is published in todays new england journal of medicine the results showed that of the physicians who responded acknowledged they had accepted some form of gifts or money from the pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing firms more specifically reported they allowed company representatives to treat them to meals took free drug samples and accepted reimbursements for the costs of attending educational conferences hosted by drug companies which in some cases included travel food and lodging in addition received fees for consulting speaking engagements and enrolling patients in clinical trials and said they accepted tickets to cultural and sporting events the studys researchers refrained from drawing any conclusions about the ramifications of doctors ties to industry but in an interview david blumenthal a harvard medical school professor and the studys principal investigator said free gifts can lead doctors to prescribe brand name drugs when less expensive generic versions may be just as effective "we all know that gifts and gratuities create a subconscious sense of indebtedness " prof blumenthal said "and they improve the likelihood of a physician using that particular drug companys brand of medicine " the studys results come at a time when many in the medical profession are calling for stricter codes of conduct that would bar doctors from accepting even such things as free drug samples pens and flashlights from pharmaceutical companies yale university medical school and other schools have implemented recommendations that their physicians decline any type of gifts from drug companies and the american medical association strongly recommends that doctors not accept gifts worth more than &# numerous studies have been conducted in recent years examining physician industry relationships but most of them have focused on particular medical specialties or geographic regions the new study by a team of researchers from harvard university yale university and the university of melbourne is among the first to poll doctors across the u s questionnaires were sent to physicians in six specialties anesthesiology cardiology family practice general surgery internal medicine and pediatrics in late and the studys investigators noted that drug companies concentrated their marketing efforts on the medical specialties where doctors had the most influence in choosing which drugs to prescribe the researchers observed that cardiologists were more than twice as likely as family practitioners to accept consulting and other fees while family practitioners and doctors in small practices met more frequently with industry representatives than physicians in hospitals and clinics where decisions on which drugs to prescribe are more likely decided by administrators some physicians however question whether any broad conclusions can be made from such surveys "if a physician can be influenced into prescribing certain drugs just because he had pizza with a pharmaceutical guy then its the fault of his training and not the drug company " said thomas stossel a harvard university medical school professor who wasnt involved with the study
