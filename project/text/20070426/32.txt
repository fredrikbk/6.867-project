cable giant comcast tries to channel web tv comcast corp which has more subscribers than any other cable operator in the u s has joined in the fray over which web site is going to become the top destination for tv shows movies and other professionally produced videos google inc s youtube has for the time being won the battle to become the premier site for short amateur videos now a host of major internet players and others including amazon com inc time warner inc s aol division joost brightcove and apple inc are all maneuvering to claim dominant positions in the world of prime time shows and other premium entertainment content thats started to mushroom on the web comcast is hoping to play the same middleman role on the internet that it does on traditional tv buying programming from entertainment companies and packaging it for consumers earlier this month the philadelphia based giant announced plans to launch fancast com an ad supported free tv and entertainment site comcast has stuck deals to carry prime time content produced by cbs fox and nbc on fancast including shows like "survivor " "heroes" and "house " "being the place people go to for video content is what we have always done and it makes sense to provide content online as well " says brian roberts comcasts chief executive comcasts push into the web comes at a time when there is widespread speculation that video on the internet will pose a major threat to the cable industrys bread and butter tv business some programmers and movie studios already have begun to pipe high quality video directly over the internet to viewers televisions bypassing cable operators but comcasts move raises the possibility that cable operators may be able to benefit from the skyrocketing popularity of web video the company already has launched web sites that are boosting usage of other services for example ziddio com a user generated content site puts winners of amateur video contests on comcast video on demand comcast wades into the web tv battle with several advantages for starters the company is the countrys second largest provider of high speed internet hookups after at&amp t inc with over million customers it already has used that business to turn its portal comcast net into the st most visited domain on the web for u s users according to comscore media metrix but competing for viewers on the internet presents a different and in some ways more difficult set of challenges for comcast than wrestling with satellite and telephone operators over pay tv customers in its traditional business comcast usually is the only cable operator in an area giving it enormous leverage over programmers but on the web comcast will just be one of many sites carrying the same content full length nbc shows for example already are being carried on the networks own site itunes and will also be available on a new internet tv site that fox and nbc are creating "our customers have shown they dont all go to one place " says george kliavkoff chief digital officer of nbc universal and the interim chief executive of nbcs new venture with fox "there is incredible value in giving them as much choice as we possibly can " to play a dominant role in web tv comcast also will need to do more than simply accumulate the most mainstream content other sites have been focusing on amassing thousands of videos that appeal to ethnic groups hobbyists and other niche audiences competitors also are adding social networking and other features to their sites to distinguish them from traditional television comcast executives say they are developing such features but others say the cable operator has a lot of catching up to do "its not clear to me that comcast has the dna or the understanding to do something like that " says jeremy allaire the chief executive of brightcove comcast was one of the first cable operators to begin featuring web video on its broadband portal for four years it has been loading up comcast net with music videos movie trailers and other short content as a way of attracting and retaining high speed internet subscribers the move has been part of comcasts broader strategy code named "eureka " to combine its tv internet and telephone services lately comcast also has begun looking to extract revenue out of its web sites as well the company currently is choosing among google yahoo inc microsoft corp and aol for internet advertising and search services for comcast net and its other sites the deals are expected to generate &# million a year for the company starting in people familiar with the matter say some of the new ads will be inserted into videos comcasts move into web video is partly defensive like other producers and distributors of tv content it was horrified by the devastating impact of the internet on the music business company executives acknowledge what theyre trying to do is tricky create new places for consumers to view tv programming without hurting the value of their traditional cable business so far web tv doesnt seem to be cannibalizing traditional television networks like nbc and cbs say that making their prime time shows available on the internet is increasing the audience for their regular tv programming viewers are able to do things like keep up with a series by watching a missed episode on the web "we see online viewing as incremental not as a substitute " says amy banse president of comcast interactive media also comcast has little choice but to move into web video starting in when walt disney co s abc unit announced plans to make episodes of shows like "desperate housewives" available on itunes there has been a steady stream of top tv content onto the web today much of the prime time lineup offered by the major broadcast networks can be found on the web the day after the shows have aired comcast doesnt want to cede the central role it plays in traditional tv to some other player on the internet fancast is a key part of trying to retain that role comcast has designed fancast to be the leading source of content and information on the web about tv and the movies users interested in a particular actor for example will be able to find out all the movies and tv shows in which he has appeared and how to find them on the web or tv if the actor is in a recently released movie users will be able to buy tickets to a local theater through fandango com which comcast recently acquired eventually consumers would be able to purchase dvds and download movies through fancast as well the cable giant will use its broadband service to promote fancast in the parts of the country it serves which include of the top major metropolitan areas but it will have a harder time in other areas where names like yahoo and aol have much better name recognition comcast also is exploring whether to take a lead role in allowing customers to buy or rent a video on the web and watch it on their televisions the company has been upgrading its network modernizing equipment and increasing bandwidth available to broadband subscribers partly with an eye toward offering such services "comcast can hold itself out as a potential friend to the content owner by giving them a well lit place for offering video legally " says craig moffett a cable analyst at sanford c bernstein
