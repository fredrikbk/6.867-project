journal exchange the informed reader environment why climate engineering would be risky the wilson quarterly spring frustrated with the limits of public policy to tackle global warming some scientists say the time has come to engineer a way to control the weather the idea might seem appealing a science scholar says but it could have potentially harmful ramifications climate engineering has become a popular topic among a group of scientists skeptical of the potential of other environmental remedies from carbon taxes to alternative energy writes james r fleming a professor of science technology and society at colby college but the potential fixes being discussed reflect an overconfidence in technology mr fleming says as well as an ignorance of the history of failed efforts to control the weather one idea put forth by a physicist involved in climate control discussions would involve bombarding the arctic stratosphere with specially engineered particles to deflect the suns rays thereby lowering temperatures alternatively a fleet of crop dusting airplanes could deliver the particles by flying continuously around the arctic circle an astronomer suggested placing a huge fleet of mirrors in orbit to divert solar radiation some of these ideas says mr fleming are reminiscent of the optimism that framed the first attempts at climate control which date to the th century in the s scientists developed cloud seeding to produce rainfall a technique that was later adopted by the u s military during the vietnam war to hinder enemy troops movements the risk that modern climate controls would be similarly used for military purposes is one of the dangers of the latest batch of ideas says mr fleming whats more the climate system is so complex that it would be difficult to ever predict how such controls would affect nature and which countries mr fleming wonders could be trusted to equitably control weather in different parts of the world in the face of a potential climate crisis doing nothing or too little is "clearly wrong but so is doing too much "
