up for the e mail here it was roughly a year ago that ben bernankes early public comments as federal reserve chief triggered market volatility and doubts about the new chairman but his message was more consistent than critics acknowledged and months later his economic stewardship appears a lot sturdier as well which surely hasnt hurt the recently surging stock market events on both the growth and inflation side of the feds economic see saw have generally evolved toward the balance it has tried to engineer at a time when both slowing expansion and potential price rises have loomed as threats as the central banks own compilation of regional economic reports notes most fed districts reported "only modest or moderate expansions in economic activity since the previous report however two new york and minneapolis reported steady and firm growth respectively and dallas characterized growth as moderately strong " retail sales tourism and service sector activity especially for companies that serve businesses have been positive manufacturing activity has been slow but partly as a reflection of generally softening business conditions in two sectors that are already well known vehicles and real estate construction weakening residential mortgage activity has also taken a toll offsetting improvement in commercial and industrial lending while "activity in the energy and mining sectors has remained at high levels " the fed says tight labor market conditions continue to be a source of inflation worry with consumer prices generally remaining stable though manufacturing

also easing fears of an economic slowdown the commerce department yesterday reported that businesses were spending at a healthy pace on computers machinery and other equipment in march reversing two months of declines as the wall street journal notes in the minutes of their last meeting fed policy makers had noted growth in such capital expenditures had been sluggish and the reassurance on that front is probably welcome considering the patience mr bernanke and his colleagues have been showing with both growth and inflation it was on april of last year during testimony to congress that mr bernanke suggested the fed might take a pause in what was then an uninterrupted series of interest rate increases to great market jubilation but he warned inflation was still a big worry and it took the markets time to figure out he meant what he said on both issues by august when the fed began a pause that looks set to endure at least through the next few meetings policy makers were willing to bet moderating growth and especially a slowing housing market could help bring down long term inflation without further fiddling with the cost of borrowed money last week fed gov frederic mishkin expressed satisfaction that the feds raising of interest rates from june through june had helped produce the "transition to a more moderate and sustainable pace " even if "such a transition will no doubt be marked by some bumps in the road " and he predicted the most likely outcome in the coming quarters was "a continued moderate rate of economic expansion accompanied by some easing of pressures on resources " as the wall street journal notes economists differ over how much the economy is reflected by u s stock markets the dow jones industrial average for the first time closed above the mark

of "big negatives " interest rates dont seem to be a big source of worry also of note new york times the justice department has asked a federal appeals court to impose tighter restrictions on the
