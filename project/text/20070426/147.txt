overseas funds demand a bit of prudence years of solid performance may lead to overlooking possible troubles ahead a recent survey of wealthy american investors found that more than half believe u s markets are riskier than international markets thats a reversal of traditional thinking and a sign that investors may be taking potential problems in overseas markets too lightly given that foreign markets have been outpacing u s stocks for the past five years now isnt the time to get complacent analysts say overseas stocks remain volatile and investors cant afford to be caught making big bets perhaps inadvertently on what might turn out to be risky international holdings provided theyve been following the drumbeat of advice calling for diversity in a portfolio average investors will own at least one foreign fund in their individual retirement account or k that in itself is no cause for alarm says gregg wolper senior fund analyst at morningstar inc "its important to know that international funds in general should not be thought of as substantially risky investments " mr wolper says "the key is finding out what kind of international fund it is in the same way as you would a fund that invests in the u s " one quick way of assessing risk in an international mutual fund is to find out how much exposure it has to emerging markets with a broad international mutual fund likely to have an to stake "if you have an international fund that has an emerging market stake higher than thats unusually high and would add to risk because emerging markets are more likely to fall more sharply than the big developed markets are " he says similarly funds that have large small cap stakes also face additional volatility though that can sometimes pay off a couple of examples of what mr wolper considers the best performing overseas funds that have higher than average emerging market stakes are oakmark international fund and julius baer international equity i and ii sector allocation is something investors may not be heeding closely enough in their international funds says jeffrey kleintop chief market strategist at lpl financial services he says a fund that concentrates too heavily on the bric countries brazil russia india china could be presenting a fairly sizable risk for that investor given the sectors involved energy and materials make up of the market cap of those countries he says "youre making a pretty big bet on the continuation of the bull market for commodities thats a risk you may not be aware of " conversely mr kleintop says some international funds may be lacking in exposure to certain sectors "most international markets are more value oriented than those here in the u s for example looking at the europe australasia far east index that only has one third the weighting of technology we have in the standard &amp poors stock index half the weighting we have in health care we would consider those to be growth sectors from a style perspective " since he predicts those sectors are poised for a rebound "if you own an international value fund you may want to switch to an international growth fund " mr kleintop says the best time for investors to take on more risk is when they may be least inclined to do so "generally the international markets perform best when theyre coming out of a broad economic downturn " he says eric leve senior vice president of international equity research at bailard and co portfolio manager for the highmark international opportunities fund suggests investors take a look at their individual funds performance with respect to competitive rankings such as morgan stanley capital internationals eafe index or the msci all country world ex u s index a fund that varies too far from the median performance of the benchmark especially one that vacillates on either side is probably taking large bets that may pose too much risk for average retail investors he says
