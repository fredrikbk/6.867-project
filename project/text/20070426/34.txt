cancer and the candidates when former senator fred thompson announced this month that he has cancer the disclosure got a lot of attention not so much because mr thompson is a star of tvs "law &amp order " hes also thinking of running for the republican presidential nomination and so as he himself points out the state of his health has become our business mr thompson has indolent lymphoma a historically incurable but often symptom free and highly treatable form of cancer so based on his doctors advice he was able to predict that he is likely to live a normal life but thats not the only reason why just a couple of weeks after his health news we could read a news report about a possible thompson candidacy that didnt even mention cancer until relatively late in the story times have changed both for cancer prognoses and the way we look at the disease ask two other republican hopefuls john mccain and rudy giuliani both of whom have had cancer as have john kerry and a host of politicians around the country they along with people like lance armstrong are only the famous faces among millions of americans who have benefited from advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment the disease remains a cruel killer in too many cases what almost everybody now knows however is that it is not an automatic death sentence and increasingly can be subdued or managed perhaps this is why according to polls on the subject a majority of voters say they wouldnt consider a cancer diagnosis past or present an automatic disqualification for a candidate thats good news because it suggests that otherwise qualified men and women wont be denied an opportunity to provide and we to benefit from their leadership yet the new outlook on cancer also means that openness and honesty about a candidates health are more important than ever especially when it comes to the presidency citizens have a right to expect that the person they put at the helm of the most powerful nation on earth is mentally and physically fit to serve the concealment of candidate and then president john f kennedys debilitating addisons disease was as wrong then as it would be now we had a right to know how ill he was especially because the soviets as they planned to send missiles to cuba for instance certainly had an inkling in more recent times of fuller presidential disclosure bill clintons refusal to disclose his medical records was a revealing as it turned out insult to the people who elected him then there was democratic presidential hopeful paul tsongas who won the new hampshire primary in but misled voters into thinking that his cancer had not returned had he become president he would have died in office no one who has had a serious health problem can know for sure what will happen in the future yet precisely because americans are more and more willing to hope for the best candidates have a special responsibility to speak truthfully about their health by being open about his cancer fred thompson seems to be keeping up his end of a tentative deal with voters that says if you tell us whats going on we wont automatically assume youre not fit for office but the emerging bargain is still a fragile one anything less than candor from a candidate and it may be broken beyond repair
