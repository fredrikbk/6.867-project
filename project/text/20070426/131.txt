mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i followed the instructions you printed last week for alphabetizing the favorites in internet explorer but they didnt work for me i am using ie in windows xp on a dell computer a in ie it only works if you display your favorites list using the menu command not the icon q you often mention the macintosh as an alternative to windows why dont you recommend the linux operating system a i aim my columns at mainstream users doing typical tasks who have little or no technical knowledge no help from experts and no appetite for becoming techies these folks want the computer to do things for them they dont want to have to do much if any configuring of or maintaining of their computers they have no patience for geeky procedures for instance when they buy a peripheral device they expect to plug it in and find that it works often without even installing the cd from the box i dont believe linux is yet simple enough and automatic enough and nontechnical enough for these mainstream users so i dont recommend it i firmly believe that the macintosh does meet these criteria and so i consider it the only practical alternative to windows for mainstream nontechie users q my friend claims that dell has now decided to resume offering windows xp as an option on its consumer model computers instead of only offering variations of windows vista is this true a yes dell announced last week that it is bringing back xp as an option on a handful of its consumer laptops and desktops the models include the inspiron and and the dimension e and e a quick check of the dell web site shows at least one other consumer model available with windows xp the xps level
