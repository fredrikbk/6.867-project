second chance new way to extend fertility freeze tissue from ovaries surgery could expand choices for women but ethics are debated stored at subzero temperatures in a laboratory at st lukes hospital in st louis are eight tiny strips of tissue that were once part of amy johnsons ovaries ms johnson years old plans to keep the tissue frozen and transplant it back into her ovaries if she has a hard time getting pregnant in the future back inside her body the strips would produce relatively youthful eggs even if ms johnson is in her s or has reached menopause "i call it the backup plan " says ms johnson a part time business consultant in ann arbor mich she had postponed starting a family while her husband a professor sought tenure recently she became pregnant with her first child who was conceived without medical help but shes glad to have the tissue on hand in case she has trouble conceiving later for women who want to delay child rearing technology is presenting an intriguing option while the technique is still highly experimental evidence is rising that women who receive their own transplanted ovarian tissue can start ovulating again and get pregnant "this has the potential to be one of the largest breakthroughs for reproductive choice in women " says pamela madsen executive director of the american fertility association a patient advocacy organization "for women to be able to bank their tissue and then come back when they are ready in their lives to have their children is tremendous " so far most of the hundreds of women who have frozen their ovarian tissue did so for a medical reason typically they were about to get chemotherapy treatment for cancer that would leave them infertile a thornier question is whether the procedure is justified for healthy women who want to wait for pregnancy so they can advance their careers or find the right man david battaglia a fertility specialist at oregon health &amp science university in portland notes that the techniques safety and efficacy are unproven because only a handful of births have taken place using it "the ethical concerns are doing a surgery on a perfectly healthy woman " says dr battaglia who doesnt currently recommend it to patients for nonmedical reasons the surgery entails making a small incision below the navel to remove all or part of the ovary and women may experience significant discomfort for several days sherman silber ms johnsons surgeon in st louis is among the pioneers of the technique and believes it should be available broadly "patients have to be informed and know what their options are but if they make an informed decision who would deny them the right to preserve their fertility " he asks demand is rising doctors say although the procedure costs several thousand dollars laurel stadtmauer of the jones institute for reproductive medicine in norfolk va says her clinic has been getting "more and more" calls from career minded women asking about ovarian tissue freezing and similar ways to prolong fertility dr stadtmauer doesnt recommend tissue freezing for lifestyle reasons though she says shes open to offering it if patients want it because ovarian tissue transplantation may kick start ovulation even in a woman who has already gone through menopause the technique raises a further ethical quandary what should be the age limit for pregnancy before doing the procedure in older women "we have first to think about what we are going to accept and not accept " says isabelle demeestere whose group works on the technique at the free university of brussels a woman is born with roughly a million immature eggs in her ovaries each month beginning with puberty one will mature for ovulation but hundreds of the immature eggs will also die every month a woman in her teens has about immature eggs in her ovaries that dwindles to by age and about by cells surrounding the eggs contain the hormones that drive ovulation once they run out the hormones do too and a woman enters menopause as years go by the quality of the remaining eggs also declines making it harder to get pregnant with a healthy baby "the most heartbreaking thing is speaking to and year old women who find out that their ovarian reserve is low or nonexistent and that the only way they could have a child is through egg donation " says ms madsen of the patient advocacy organization the point of ovarian tissue freezing is to bypass this otherwise inescapable drop in the quantity and quality of eggs doctors remove the millimeter thick outer shell of the ovary which contains the immature eggs they divide the shell into strips and place the strips in a kind of antifreeze and then chill it to about minus degrees celsius in theory the immature eggs should retain their youth indefinitely when reimplanted in a woman the strips can recruit their own blood supply and start producing mature eggs in the s scottish researchers tested the procedure in sheep in one study they first removed the ovaries from eight animals and froze several slices of tissue from the ovaries a month later the tissue was thawed and four ovarian strips were transplanted back into each sheep during the following breeding season they all had regular ovulation cycles and one became pregnant with triplets scientists achieved similar success in mice and rabbits the first significant demonstration in humans came in a year old woman had had her ovaries removed due to medical conditions years earlier and strips of tissue from one of them were frozen and banked new york fertility researcher kutluk oktay transplanted that tissue back into the woman and reported that it began to function again since then doctors have reported two babies born with the technique one in belgium and one in israel some controversy surrounds the belgian case because its possible the fertilized egg came from an existing ovary not the transplanted ovarian tissue a third pregnancy yet to be reported in a medical journal is ongoing with a due date this summer it involves a woman who had banked ovarian tissue in before chemotherapy for hodgkins disease the woman has had tissue reimplanted twice first in after which she began to ovulate and got pregnant but miscarried and last year which resulted in another pregnancy "this procedure proves that its possible to restore fertility " says dr demeestere in brussels whose team did the transplant the success rate of the technique remains uncertain while hundreds of women have banked ovarian tissue most havent decided to thaw it yet leaving little way to judge the percentages "i think we need an awful lot more data out there to see whether it works or not " says dr battaglia of oregon health &amp science university dr silber who treated ms johnson and directs the infertility center of st louis at st lukes hospital believes the procedure has a good chance of working if women freeze tissue in their s or early s one basis for that judgment is his success in a related type of surgery ovarian tissue transplants between identical twins in this surgery a woman who has become infertile receives tissue from her fertile twin the difference with ms johnsons procedure is that the tissue neednt be frozen because it is quickly transferred from one twin to the other in dr silber and his colleagues reported in the new england journal of medicine a successful pregnancy and birth in a twin stephanie yarber had undergone menopause prematurely in her teens she received ovarian tissue from her identical twin sister at age not long thereafter she started to ovulate the eggs came from her sisters tissue and she got pregnant during her second menstrual cycle giving birth to a healthy baby girl since then dr silber has worked with other sets of twins in a report last month in the new england journal of medicine he wrote that in six additional cases women began to get their periods and ovulate within months of receiving ovarian tissue from their twins three of those six conceived and ms yarber got pregnant again a study by researchers at the university of valencia in spain suggests the odds of the transplanted tissue working are fairly good the study published last month in the journal human reproduction involved female volunteers who couldnt have children because they needed their uterus removed for medical reasons as part of the study the volunteers had both ovaries removed doctors took the shell of the left ovary containing immature eggs and transplanted it to where the right ovary had been after two years of the women were ovulating regularly although six of them needed several months to get back to normal dr silbers clinic is a rare example of a major u s clinic offering ovarian tissue freezing to healthy women who plan to get pregnant later in life doctors in the field say they dont know of anyone else doing that "what is the difference between losing your fertility from aging of your ovary or from cancer treatment either way you are losing your fertility and freezing either your eggs or your ovarian tissue can preserve that fertility " says dr silber a perpetually busy year old he works some to hours a week and travels constantly colleagues describe him as exceptionally skilled in stitching together some of the bodys smallest and thinnest structures in the s dr silber pioneered vasectomy reversals designing a technique to unblock a mans sperm duct which is about a hundredth of an inch thick earlier this year he transplanted a whole ovary from one woman to her infertile sister a challenging procedure because the vessels used to reattach the organ are extremely small theoretically a whole ovary transplant by ensuring an immediate blood supply could be superior to an ovarian tissue transplant but the surgery is so difficult that its unclear if it can ever become widely used some think that dr silber is going too far by offering ovarian tissue freezing to the general public "how can the patient be informed if you really dont know the true success rates " asks dr oktay the surgeon in new york he fears patients may have exaggerated expectations about their chances of getting pregnant in later years dr oktay heads a group at the american society for reproductive medicine that is updating guidelines for fertility preservation current guidelines at the society the main organization for fertility specialists recommend against ovarian tissue freezing for lifestyle reasons ms johnson a self described biology buff considers herself a well informed patient she says dr silber explained to her the pros and cons of the procedure one option that ms johnson and others in her position typically consider is freezing mature eggs this is different from freezing ovarian tissue which contains thousands of immature eggs but none that are ready to be fertilized by sperm the end result however is similar both procedures may enable women to take advantage of the fertility of their younger years when theyre older to boost their production of mature eggs women undergo rounds of hormone shots doctors then retrieve the eggs with a minimally invasive procedure and freeze them when the woman is ready to get pregnant sperm are introduced to the eggs through in vitro fertilization and the resulting embryo is implanted in the womb experience with egg freezing is growing and about babies world wide have been born with the technique says dr oktay initial pregnancy rates were low but dr oktay and others say the success rate is now up to thanks to improved freezing techniques dreading her bodys reaction to the hormone treatments ms johnson decided against egg freezing cost was also an issue she paid about &# for the ovarian banking procedure while egg freezing treatments can cost &# or more still her recovery from the surgery to remove her ovarian tissue wasnt easy and she says it took her a few weeks to feel like she was back to normal other challenges remain as many as half of the immature eggs in transplanted ovarian tissue die after it is reattached limiting the life of the transplant freezing and thawing the tissue may damage the eggs because they are sensitive to ice formation the biggest threat to egg survival is lack of blood flow to the tissue in the first day or two after surgery before new blood vessels grow into the transplant ms yarber began to run out of eggs three years after her first transplant from her twin sister last month she got a new transplant of ovarian tissue from her sister dr silber says centers around the world are trying to solve those problems one new freezing technique called vitrification is yielding encouraging results in blocking ice crystals from forming on eggs and destroying them perhaps the biggest obstacle to the techniques widespread adoption is a social one "weve had people in their late s and early s say they want to store their tissue but by then its too late " says roger gosden laboratory director at cornell universitys center for reproductive medicine and infertility "the technique needs to be taken up at a younger age and whether young women will be sufficiently concerned about fertility in their early s i dont know "
