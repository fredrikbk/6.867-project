juicy details ms brown says she set out to write a book that examined the princess in a media and social context while discussing the impact of celebrity culture "why diana was important why she continues to fascinate and what we should make of her years after her death " ms browns own celebrity will feed a major marketing blitz for the book it will be a july main selection of bertelsmanns book of the month club and an excerpt will appear in the july issue of vanity fair that hits newsstands in early june ms brown will appear on abcs "good morning america" june and "its a very strong lineup " says stephen rubin president of doubleday broadway publishing group of late ms brown a year old native of england who is now a u s citizen has been outside the media whirl she once dominated her magazine start up "talk" was canceled in she left her cnbc talk show in after her two year contract expired to work on the diana book and later suspended her weekly washington post column for the same reason to take on that project she canceled an earlier title "the icarus complex " about the fall from grace of rich overachievers such as martha stewart and enrons kenneth lay which she had agreed to write for random house americans have always had a soft spot for the royal family the nation that prides itself on its rejection of traditional aristocracy is also fascinated by it princess diana has been on the cover of people magazine times more than anyone else on the screen "the queen " about the royal familys handling of the days immediately following dianas death produced a healthy &# million in u s box office receipts according to exhibitor relations co and a best actress oscar for helen mirren americans relate to the cinderella story of a shy awkward girl who turned into a glamorous star "what makes it an ongoing saga is that her memory lives on through her husband and the actions of her two sons " says lorraine shanley a partner in market partners international inc an industry consulting company the recent breakup of prince william princess dianas older son and his former girlfriend kate middleton was splashed across magazines on both sides of the atlantic those affections have limits two major entries last year paul burrells "the way we were remembering diana" and sarah bradfords "diana " never caught fire "the diana books have been trending down from a

there is still enough interest in princess diana to create sustained sales "its a gamble for us " says vivien jennings owner of rainy day books in fairway kan "will there be new information and pictures people havent seen before and will there be so much news coverage that people wont have to read the book " ms jennings says she has ordered copies of "the diana chronicles" because those who are interested will want to buy the book immediately "we cant miss a sale " she says ms browns book doesnt have a photo spread elsewhere the book stall at chestnut court in winnetka ill has ordered only two copies based on weak sales of recent diana related titles "publicity could save the diana chronicles but there isnt a lot of enthusiasm in the heartland " says roberta rubin owner one potential bright sign a customer has already reserved a copy "somebody has gotten word so ill buy a few more " says ms rubin alison weir a writer of histories about the monarchy says there are two schools of thought regarding princess diana in england as time has passed some are more willing to see her flaws but for many others her life and death remain an emotional touchstone "were a world obsessed with youth and she never ages " says ms weir that she died as the mother of two young boys and during the midst of a romance gilds her as both tragic and heroic ms brown a longtime diana watcher who shared a meal with the princess only a few months before her death says she developed "a great affection for diana" during the course of writing her book ms brown describes a woman with an intellectual inferiority complex "she used to say im thick as a plank what she had was a huge emotional intelligence that people responded to " that princess dianas mother left the family for another man when diana was still quite young created a woman whose "neediness collided with a culture designed not to meet those needs it couldnt have been more cataclysmic " although doubleday has tried to keep the book under wraps the daily mail in london has published several stories so far about it one of which says "princess diana was a manipulative schemer who was ruthless in her pursuit of prince charles a bombshell book will claim the account of her extraordinary life to be published weeks before the tenth anniversary of her death paints the princess as spiteful media savvy and neurotic " the story attracted dismayed comments from some online readers but ms brown says "the book is an affectionate and multifaceted portrayal of diana " not a hatchet job the english press she says is "all about steering and generating conflict "
