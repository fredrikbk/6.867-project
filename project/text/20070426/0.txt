a capital idea that americas public capital markets have lost some of their allure is no longer much disputed eminences as unlikely as chuck schumer and eliot spitzer have taken to bemoaning the fact and calling for some sort of fix albeit without doing much tort reform to reduce jackpot justice in securities class action suits would certainly help so would easing the compliance costs and regulatory burden placed on publicly traded companies by sarbanes oxley regulation fd and the like the good news is that as usual private sector innovation is finding a way around these government obstacles through the rapid growth of something known as the rule a market first a little capital markets background most americans are familiar with the "public markets " which consist of the new york stock exchange the nasdaq and other stock markets these are open to investors of every stripe and are where the stocks of most of the worlds best known companies are traded nearly anyone can invest and these exchanges are comprehensively regulated by the securities and exchange commission less well understood is another more restricted market known after sec rule a that governs participation in it as on stock exchanges this market allows for the buying and selling of the stock of companies that offer their shares for sale but participation is strictly limited to be what is called a "qualified buyer" in this market you must be a financial institution with at least &# million in investable assets if you meet these criteria you are free to buy stocks of both u s and foreign companies that have never offered their shares to the investing public and heres the real beauty of it companies that issue stock under rule a can access americas deep pools of capital without submitting to public company accounting rules or to the tender mercies of sarbanes oxley in exchange however they must strictly limit the number of qualified u s investors in their company to total for u s based firms and for foreign based they are also barred from offering comparable securities for sale in the public market the a market is also for the most part nontransparent often illiquid and thus in some ways riskier but increasingly this is a trade that institutional investors and companies seeking capital are willing to make there are estimated to be about companies whose stocks trade in the a market and last year for perhaps the first time more capital was raised in the u s by issuing these so called unregistered securities than through ipos on all the major stock exchanges combined even more telling is that the large institutional investors eligible to buy these unregistered securities are more than happy to oblige there is no selling without buying and for the a market to overtake the giant stock exchanges institutional investors who control trillions of dollars in capital must see better opportunities outside the regulations built by congress and the sec in a sign of these times none other than nasdaq is now stepping in to bring some greater order liquidity and transparency to the rule a market any day now the sec is expected to propose giving the green light to a nasdaq project called portal portal aims to be a central clearing house for buyers and sellers of section a securities you will still need to be a "qualified institutional buyer" to purchase a securities and the companies whose stocks change hands on portal will still need to meet the limitations on numbers of investors to offer their stock there so portal will not bring unregistered securities to the masses at least not directly it is forbidden to do so because the entire u s regulatory system is designed to protect individual investors from such things what portal will do if it operates as intended is make the trading of rule a securities easier and less costly and this could in turn further increase their attractiveness to issuers and investors alike average investors will at least be able to participate indirectly via mutual and pension funds most of which meet the standards for "qualified institutional buyers " given the limitations on eligibility for rule a assets they will never replace our public markets but their growth is one more sign that investors far from valuing current regulation are seeking ways to avoid its costs and complications nasdaqs participation is especially notable given its stake as an established public exchange nasdaq seems to have concluded that there is a new market opportunity created by overregulation so it is following the money this leaves our politicians with two choices they can move to meddle with and diminish this second securities market which will only drive more business away from u s shores or they can address the overregulation that is hurting public markets and prompting both investors and companies to seek alternatives
