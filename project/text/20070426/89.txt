home equity stalls as housing market cools and rates rise owners grow wary of tapping lines of credit how banks are courting borrowers after years of piling debt on their homes americans are becoming more cautious about using them as a piggy bank a cooling housing market and higher interest rates have made homeowners more reluctant to tap the equity they may have built up in their residences the amount borrowers owe on their home equity lines of credit has slipped in the past six months to &# billion at the end of march the first such decline since according to new data from equifax inc and moodys economy com inc although that decline was partly offset by a pickup in fixed rate home equity loans total home equity borrowing rose just in the months through march well below the average annual growth rate of the past five years "people are feeling uncertain about the value of their home and are feeling tapped out " says doreen woo ho president of wells fargo &amp co s consumer credit group some homeowners have decided to "wait and see what happens to real estate " says david rupp bank of america corp s home equity executive "or they may view themselves as not needing to borrow " during the housing boom demand for home equity lines of credit climbed sharply as property values rose interest rates fell and lenders made it easy for borrowers to tap their equity for everything from home improvements to vacations borrowing against home equity freed up roughly &# billion in cash per year between and that was used to pay off other debts and for new spending according to a recent paper by former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and fed economist james kennedy now the slowdown in home equity borrowing is leading to weaker sales in some markets for autos building materials and electronics says mark zandi chief economist of economy com the slowdown has been particularly notable in parts of the country that are suffering most from housing and mortgage corrections including boston minneapolis miami las vegas and washington rising short term interest rates have driven rates on home equity lines of credit to an average of up from as little as in april according to hsh associates home equity lines carry a variable rate usually tied to the prime lending rate and give homeowners the right to borrow up to a certain amount either all at once or over time meanwhile rates on home equity loans which provide borrowers with a fixed rate and a lump sum have also increased but not as much as lines of credit home equity loans average up from since april hsh says as a result more borrowers have opted for the stability of a fixed rate home equity loan over the flexibility offered by a line of credit balances on fixed rate home loans climbed to &# billion in the months ended in march according to equifax and economy com also some borrowers who already have lines of credit are refinancing into a new fixed rate mortgage or fixing the rate on some or all of their credit line an increasingly common option says mitch ohlbaum a mortgage broker in los angeles rates on year fixed rate mortgages currently average hsh says felice soule a medical device saleswoman in los angeles cut the balance on her home equity line of credit to &# from about &# when she refinanced her &# million mortgage this week the rate on the home equity line had jumped by more than two percentage points to since she took out the credit line two years ago "by refinancing and rolling most of the home equity line into the first mortgage its saving me around &# a month " she says but keith gumbinger an hsh mortgage analyst says this strategy doesnt make sense for every borrower by doing a cash out refinance youre also extending the length of your mortgage which means your "total interest charges over time are likely to be higher" than they would be with a home equity line or loan he says and in some cases borrowers may face a prepayment penalty which can range from a few hundred dollars to of the loan amount if they close down their home equity line or loan in the first few years even at todays higher rates a home equity line or loan can be an attractive option rates are generally lower than for most other sources of financing and interest payments are typically tax deductible most borrowers who have owned their homes for several years still have plenty of equity they can tap "if you need the money to clear up some credit card debt its certainly worth the trade off " says david lesnick a financial planner in goodyear ariz but mr lesnick is also advising clients to proceed with caution "if its something that could wait let it wait " he says lenders are responding to slowing demand for home equity borrowing by boosting their marketing unveiling special offers and focusing on traditional uses of home equity such as home improvement and debt consolidation wells fargo this week rolled out a "home improvement program" that gives home equity customers discounts at retailers such as best buy brookstone and lampsplus com and access to a network of third party local contractors j p morgan chase &amp co is running its first cable television advertising campaign for home equity borrowing focusing on the products flexibility its also rolling out a training program designed to help bankers in chase branches do a better job of selling home equity products bank of america has launched a "green" home equity card program in which the bank will make a &# donation to environmental group conservation international on behalf of new home equity customers who use their equity line visa card for purchases of &# or more delinquencies on home equity lines of credit also have climbed to in the first quarter according to a separate study by equifax and economy com thats up from a year earlier and the highest level since early partly as a result lenders are tightening their standards that in turn is making it tougher for some borrowers to get so called piggyback mortgages which combine a mortgage with a home equity loan or line of credit and allow borrowers to finance more than of a homes value without paying mortgage insurance national city corp says that in the past days it has tightened its standards for home equity loans made to borrowers providing little if any documentation of their income or assets e kennedy carter jr a national city executive vice president says the bank saw applications for these loans jump as other lenders withdrew from the market when institutions who invest in mortgage backed securities lost their appetite for riskier loans citigroup inc s citibank this month also tightened its eligibility standards for home equity loans gibran nicholas a mortgage broker in ann arbor mich says one of his clients was hoping to tap the equity on his &# million home in an effort to make up for a sharp drop in his income but couldnt because he had been late on some payments "lenders are not looking to do financing for people with less than stellar credit " mr nicholas says corrections &amp amplifications the figures in a chart accompanying a personal journal article on thursday that showed the growth in home equity lending should have been labeled as hundreds of billions of dollars they were incorrectly labeled as billions of dollars wsj april
