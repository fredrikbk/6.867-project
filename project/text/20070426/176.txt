" as recently as last week mr kleinfeld still appeared to have enough support on the supervisory board to win a five year contract extension but the pendulum swung as a growing number of board members began to believe siemens needed new leadership to help it emerge from the scandals mr kleinfelds position had begun to grow tenuous in recent months as criminal probes of possible bribery at the year old company gained pace triggering several arrests no evidence has emerged that mr kleinfeld a year veteran was involved in any wrongdoing but critics contend senior executives did too little to prevent corruption that happened under their watch the departure announcement came less than a week after heinrich von pierer mr kleinfelds predecessor announced he would step down as head of the

longtime auditor last november flagged roughly &lt euro&gt million in suspicious payments to more than a dozen consultants in the sept fiscal year prosecutors suspect company officials set up sham consulting contracts to camouflage bribes to foreign officials to secure lucrative infrastructure contracts mr kleinfeld repeatedly has said that he has "zero tolerance" for corruption and that he was unaware of illegal activity if someone had asked last year whether the mounting allegations of criminal behavior "would be possible inside of siemens i would have clearly told you i wouldnt think so " he said in an interview recently in the wake of the november police raid mr kleinfeld vowed to turn siemens into a "role model" of ethical behavior over the next several years the company quickly
