insurance monolith threatened florida in response to your april editorial "floridas folly" like theodore roosevelt i believe an elected chief executive as a servant of the people must and should responsibly wield the power of office to further the common good and improve the lives of all citizens so it follows my response as floridas governor to our states insurance crisis places people before profits when i took office this january florida faced a daunting challenge either confront head on the monolithic insurance industry or stand by and watch her citizens and her economy buckle under the oppressive weight of a deepening crisis for many years prior to my inauguration insurance companies claimed the risks were too great and the rates simply too low in florida but during that same time those companies had been raising rates at unprecedented levels some by others by more than and shedding the higher risk and more abundant coastal properties indeed contrary to recent reports the plans of allstate nationwide and others to abandon florida policyholders were set in motion well prior to my arrival those policyholders landed in the state run citizens property insurance corporation which by last december ballooned to more than million policies and &# billion in exposure yet even while the private market risk profile improved at taxpayer expense private market rates and corresponding profits continued to soar in the past two years alone the insurance industry has banked more than &# billion in profits left unchecked the insurance industry would have set florida on a collision course with fiscal ruin moreover they would have deprived many floridians of the american dream of home ownership and the hope of a secure affordable quality of life recognizing the industry was unwilling to self police and that inaction was not an option i worked with floridas leaders in a bipartisan way to enact reforms that use governments fiscal and regulatory stimulus to induce a more competitive free market under the new law florida expanded its catastrophic fund to provide lower cost reinsurance to the insurance industry allowing them to lower the rates they charge to policyholders far from an abandonment of the free market this responsible solution both lowers rates and induces free market competition consumers get immediate reductions in premiums albeit differential reductions depending on the company and the property location and consumers get more choices once reinsurance savings are reflected in the rate structure citizens property insurance corporation was also reformed to address both the availability and affordability of insurance the citizens reforms will likewise result in lower rates and more competitive choices indeed floridians are already starting to see lower rates as well as new entrants to the market of course if the ill wind blows there will be costs nevertheless had responsible action not been taken florida would have been forced to bear both those costs along with the staggering costs of economic decline that would have come with inaction while i applaud and welcome the motivation of business to profit i will not abide profiteering on the backs of the people perhaps in time the insurance industry will return to competitive free market behavior without the need for government intervention or stimulus in the interim this responsible bipartisan approach to a crisis threatening both personal quality of life and continued economic expansion was and is the only right thing to do the "trust buster" would have done no less charlie crist governor state of florida tallahassee fla see related letters "letters to the editor florida courts disaster with central planning insurance program" wsj may
