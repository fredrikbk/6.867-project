blacksburgs silver lining in the wake of an event such as virginia tech our system moves heaven and earth to figure out what went wrong and how to make sure it doesnt happen again this of course is what we did after september and after the botched response to hurricane katrina heres whats really unnerving about this inevitable "process" in june the bremer report of the national commission on terrorism described virtually everything we needed to know about preparing for the kind of attack that occurred in september similarly and you can guess what youre about to read in the final report and findings of the safe school initiative conducted by the secret service and the department of education told us virtually everything we need to know to prevent a virginia tech the good news here is that we are not as stupid as we seem we have it within our power to assign smart people to look at a manifest public problem and offer sensible fixes to be sure not all commissions do still one must ask why do we refuse to take our own best advice after the blacksburg murders one of the first words uttered in awful memory was "columbine " well columbine was among the main reasons for the safe schools effort also springfield ore west paducah ky and jonesboro ark all sites of widely publicized school shootings in all the study investigated such attacks in schools from to most interesting the study was led by the secret service why the study doesnt quite put it this way but it was because the secret services main job in life is preventing the nuts from killing someone simply the studys goal was to try to figure out what is "knowable" before an attack one of the safe school reports most relevant findings for the purposes of stopping another virginia tech is that the school attacks werent typically carried out by severely ill unhinged psychotics like cho seung hui this is not to say they were happy campers the study interviewed perpetrators in depth though few of them would get off by reason of insanity they were all mentally very unhappy campers and what is more other people knew that and in nearly every case someone knew they were planning the attack "in nearly two thirds of the incidents more than one person had information about the attack before it occurred " among the reasons widely adduced for not doing something about chos violent proclivities are hipaa and ferpa the confidentiality laws for health records and college students records well theres no ferpa for high schools there is merely the weird cultural refusal to turn in bad actors to adult authority in one school attack so many students knew it was coming that were waiting on a mezzanine to watch one with a camera the enemy is us prior to the studied assaults some of the attackers behaved in ways that caused concern to school officials teachers parents the cops or other students "in one case the students english teacher became concerned about several poems and essays that " well you know the rest psychological flameouts were indeed present in virtually all the attacks depression prior suicidal attempts or thoughts a sense of loss feelings of being persecuted or in fact bullied a lot has been made of the police failure to apprehend cho for two hours fair enough but thats not typical in the safe schools incidents most of the attacks were stopped by administrator or teachers largely because half didnt last longer than minutes the cops stopped only of the attacks an argument for deputizing and arming someone in the schools in testimony this week to the senate homeland security committee the head of the association for all campus cops explained the "safety issues" that mainly keeps them distracted "at the top of the list are issues related to high risk drinking and the use and abuse of illegal and prescription drugs " after september we learned from the commission that the left hand of the cia didnt know what the right hand of the fbi was doing that they wouldnt talk to each other or under justice department rules couldnt talk to each other but before all that the bremer anti terror report in described "complex bureaucratic procedures" that hampered the cia and an fbi suffering from "bureaucratic and cultural obstacles my emphasis to obtaining terrorism information " cultural indeed over time we have accreted a culture in the united states of rules laws liability concerns and mindsets that adds up to no can do or attorney may i after the consensus that we had to do something sank quickly in the swamps of partisanship wiretapping and incarcerating terrorists became mainly a debate game for politicians and newspaper writers if there is a sliver of silver lining in the virginia tech aftermath it is that there seems to be a willingness to look hard at the status quo no matter what assumptions pre existed about rights privacy stigma coercion security or whether we can blame it on karl rove on tuesday for example the chronicle of higher education published a piece by a professor titled "why its ok to rat on other students " here as with the message screaming off the pages of the safe school report the exhortation is to do something no matter what the intimidations of the law or received wisdom what this means is that some college presidents and their lawyers rather than rolling over before those confidentiality laws should tell some aggrieved student who is refusing to take the medication prescribed for his psychosis so sue let a judge decide whether deaths warrant a reconsideration of these restrictions as well there is no hope unless a light goes off in the collective socket of our elected politicians which illumines just how much their oh so needed laws siphon time and energy out of the daily lives of institutional leaders who a long time ago had the common sense and personal authority to chuck out a cho seung hui at the homeland security committee hearing this week sen joe lieberman i remarked "we want to respect the privacy of the individual yet ultimately i think we have a greater responsibility to protect the safety of the community " sound sensible if embraced by our politics that notion would overturn years of jurisprudence and conventional wisdom that of late has turned deadly after blacksburg it could happen
