moving the market stock rally holds attention of treasury bond investors dollars woes stay largely ignored amid high yields treasury bond investors are keeping their attention firmly focused on the rallying stock market while the dollars woes it came close to matching its record low against the euro yesterday have caused barely a stir that wont change in the weeks ahead analysts say as long as u s stocks remain a barometer of global investor risk sentiment and the dollars decline stays orderly stocks will continue to trump the greenback for a treasurys market that has been miserably range bound so far this year a declining dollar should pressure treasury prices and raise yields for two reasons it can damp foreign demand for u s government bonds with overseas buyers fearing their returns will be erased by currency loss a weak currency also means higher import prices which fuels general inflation pressures pushing long term yields in particular higher whats more the dollar has been weak not just against europes single currency which has gained versus the greenback in the past year its also around multiyear lows against other currencies from the british pound to australias dollar and brazils real yet analysts say as long as the dollars decline avoids turning into a rout it is unlikely to affect bond yields in the near term "a decline of five to percent in the dollar in a short period of time could shake global confidence in dollar assets" and send yields higher said brian carlin global head of fixed income trading at j p morgan private bank "but if it happens in an orderly fashion the market has shown its resilience its ability to absorb" weakness there are several reasons why one is the good old explanation of heavy central bank purchases official buyers main aim is to find safe liquid assets to store their foreign exchange reserves in not to maximize profits in that sense they are "almost currency agnostic " mr carlin said also softening the impact of dollar weakness is that u s yields remain higher than most of their major counterparts the year treasury yield which ended yesterdays session at with the note down point at is still some percentage point higher than the year german bund and almost three percentage points above the year japanese government bond yield a weaker dollar also means treasurys are cheaper for foreigners to buy in local currency terms as long as the dollar drop is gradual investors can hedge the currency exposure and still make decent returns imported inflation for its part has so far remained contained though that may be changing stocks have been far more influential part of the reason is straightforward asset reallocation surging stock prices will often tempt investors away from bonds and into equities yet matthew moore economic strategist at banc of america securities said the tight link between stocks and treasury prices was also because in recent months u s "equities were more of an indicator of volatility" in global financial markets that is to say when u s stocks fell as they did at the end of february it was a sign of a global spike in risk aversion that sent investors into the king of safe haven assets treasurys when stocks turned up it was a signal for investors to start adding risk again across the board the result wasnt only a fresh surge in the dow jones industrial average but higher commodity prices and robust gains across emerging market assets treasurys paid the price with the federal reserve on hold since last summer and the economys direction still unclear treasurys have spent most of this year bogged down in fairly tight ranges that has made bouncy stock markets one of the few sources of much needed market volatility derivatives boom lifts moodys profit by the
