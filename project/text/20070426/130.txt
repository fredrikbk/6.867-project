depending on traffic international visitors get a crash course in the indian economy from the hundreds of bright billboards towering over this citys sprawling slums billboard after billboard sometimes overlapping pitch everything from unilever face cream to fidelity mutual funds to samsung televisions and the latest bollywood blockbuster "shakalaka boom boom " as the economy booms the billboard business is taking off climbing more than to billion rupees &# million in the last five years according to estimates by tam media research pvt ltd a mumbai based media company while that still represents less than of total indian annual advertising spending of billion rupees it is increasingly important for targeting urban indias burgeoning middle class who now commute by car and often find themselves stuck in traffic the explosion of interest in outdoor ads in india comes as marketers in other parts of the world including the u s are putting more money into the medium as a way to reach consumers who are better able to avoid ads in traditional media such as tv and radio new technology has also allowed advertisers to create more sophisticated outdoor displays that can even transmit information to mobile devices in advertisers put &# billion into u s outdoor advertising according to the outdoor advertising association of america up from &# billion in in india "business is awesome because the economy is growing " says yash gala managing director of zenith outdoors a billboard company that has expanded its stable of billboards to from just three years ago with its billboards in use of the time "weve never seen occupancy this high " he adds only four years ago its billboards werent in use about of the time that increase translates into rising profits for billboard companies and higher prices for billboard space while print and television ads take up more than of ad spending advertisers say billboards are better for targeting specific subgroups of consumers or particular neighborhoods targeted advertising is especially important in india where diverse consumer groups with different languages religions and income levels make it tough to build a brand across the country billboards are used to reach both ends of the spending spectrum the poor who dont have tvs and dont read newspapers and upwardly mobile consumers who typically spend hours stuck in city traffic in the back of chauffeur driven cars until recently because the government only allowed a handful of radio stations radio ads werent a good way to reach commuters while regulations have eased radio advertising is still only half the size of the billboard business "this is one medium that is at the take off stage " says siddhartha mukherjee a director at tam media referring to billboards "the usage of outdoor advertising has come to the forefront because of the complexity of the indian market " "in the u s you are driving so you look at the car in front of you here you are a often passenger with a driver so you are sitting in the back and looking around " says devita saraf chief executive officer at vu technologies a high end electronics retailer he says the company has had more response from billboards in good neighborhoods in mumbai than from newspaper ads "in newspapers you may want to reach only of the readers so it is wastage " government restrictions such as a ban on erecting billboards on old buildings have held back growth in the industry so billboard companies are trying innovative ways to increase their presence zenith outdoors for example has helped develop a mobile billboard truck that parks then hoists a billboard feet on a pole and rotates it to face passing traffic the company has trucks that it can move to the places where they will capture the most eyeballs near the train stations in the morning around shopping areas during the day and then in the suburbs at night "you can reach the whole city with one billboard " says mr gala to bring better billboards to rural india where most advertising is still hand painted on walls and fences mr galas company has developed a rugged vinyl they call the "wall tattoo" that can be glued onto rough surfaces including concrete bricks and wood slates with this new product advertisers can bring large ads with the photos of movie and cricket stars who endorse their products to the rural areas where more than half of indias billion populace lives the billboard boom could eventually be curtailed however the industry can expect increasing competition from radio stations with relaxed restrictions on broadcasting the number of stations is expected to soar to more than in the next year from about now still while television print and internet advertising are also growing an increasing number of advertisers are discovering outdoor advertising for the first time "hand painted hoardings used to be the norm because labor was cheap and billboard printing equipment imports were not allowed " says ashish bhasin a director of lintas india which is compiling a computer database to help advertisers choose from more than billboard spots across the country "we are now playing a very fast catch up game " brian steinberg in new york contributed to this article
