politics &amp economics obama narrows polling gap with clinton publics concerns over iraq conflict bolster position orangeburg s c sen barack obama has pulled close to sen hillary rodham clinton in the race for the democratic nomination according to a new wall street journal nbc news poll that suggests doubts about his electability are diminishing as all democratic presidential candidates gather here for their first televised debate tonight the poll shows mr obama trailing mrs clinton by to vice presidential nominee john edwards runs a solid third with last month mr obama lagged percentage points behind moreover the poll shows that rank and file democrats and democratic leaning voters dont perceive a wide gap between the two front runners in their ability to defeat the republican nominee in next years general election say mrs clinton has the "best chance " while say mr obama does the finding indicates that just as the first term illinois senators robust early fund raising has undercut one of mrs clintons presumed advantages his relative inexperience hasnt emerged as a major impediment in his competition with the former first lady who now represents new york in the senate mr obama "seems to be gathering momentum as the candidate of change " says neil newhouse the republican pollster who helps to conduct the journal nbc survey at a time when americans want a new direction on iraq and in washington generally adds his democratic counterpart peter hart "sen obama comes closest to matching what voters are looking for in the broad political environment " the telephone survey of american adults conducted april to carries a margin of error of plus or minus percentage points clinton campaign officials have in recent weeks downplayed the significance of surveys showing a tightening in the race against sen obama noting that several other major polls continue to show mrs clinton with a large and stable lead the backdrop for the democratic horse race fueling partisans hopes for recapturing the white house next year remains deep discontent with president bush and the iraq war mr bush has vowed to veto the war funding bill that democratic house and senate leaders are preparing to send him which would establish oct as the beginning of a withdrawal of u s forces but in the showdown between the white house and congressional democrats over establishing a timeline for a troop drawdown the poll shows most americans side with congress by a lopsided to supporting that judgment is widespread pessimism about the course of the conflict three months after mr bush announced a new policy to stabilize violence by sending more troops just see evidence of improvement say conditions in iraq have gotten worse while say they have stayed the same two thirds disapprove of the presidents handling of iraq his overall job approval rating remains at and though republicans criticized senate majority leader harry reid in recent days for suggesting that the war in iraq is "lost " the survey suggests the american public is reaching a similar conclusion a majority says victory in iraq is no longer possible say victory remains within reach desire for action on iraq dominates the publics agenda and dwarfs other issues in importance some of americans call iraq a top priority for mr bush double the proportions who point to health care illegal immigration terrorism or energy in nearly identical proportions they call iraq the top priority for presidential candidates as well that may be one factor driving mr obamas rise just two years after leaving the illinois state senate and taking a u s senate seat alone among major democratic contenders mr obama publicly opposed the iraq war before mr bush initiated it in early mrs clinton and mr edwards then a senator from north carolina voted in fall to authorize the republican president to oust iraqi leader saddam hussein by force mr edwards has called that vote a mistake and apologized mrs clinton has said she wouldnt vote the same way again with todays knowledge but has refused to apologize views on the war are shaping early opinion about next years general election as well at a time when three fourths of americans say they are following the race at least "somewhat closely " americans by to say they want democrats to win the white house next year in the matchup featuring the most vivid contrast on views on iraq mr obama leads republican sen john mccain of arizona a steadfast supporter of the war effort by to that is a reversal from december when mr mccain led by to so far the survey shows mr obama has managed the rare feat of becoming widely known without accumulating significant political baggage more than eight in americans now recognize his name up from six in last fall some express a favorable view of mr obama more than triple the who view him negatively by contrast house speaker nancy pelosi has enjoyed a similar rise in public familiarity but public assessments of the california democrat are split the survey suggests that one goal for mr obamas democratic rivals may be putting a few dents in his public image mrs clinton and other democrats will get a chance to do that in tonights debate here at south carolina state university mr edwards has also proved resilient his support among democrats rose to from last month before his wife elizabeth announced she is suffering from a recurrence of cancer mr edwards continues to lead polls in iowa which kicks off the selection of nomination delegates in precinct caucuses next january other democrats have so far failed to make a national impact sen joseph biden of delaware gov bill richardson of new mexico sen christopher dodd of connecticut ohio rep dennis kucinich and former sen mike gravel of alaska all receive support of or less in the survey yet the survey is bullish for the democratic party as a whole in addition the contours of public opinion suggest a continuing dilemma for republican candidates during the nomination process though mr bush remains popular with most rank and file republicans americans overall to say they want the next president to take a different approach from the incumbent the upper hand their party currently enjoys helps explain why of democrats say they are satisfied with their field of candidates just of republicans express satisfaction with their field are dissatisfied one reflection of that discontent is the solid initial showing by former sen fred thompson of tennessee who may join the republican field the survey shows mr thompson draws outpacing former gov mitt romney of massachusetts who was the leading republican fund raiser during the first quarter of former new york city mayor rudy giuliani leads the republican field with support but that is down from last month mr mccain runs second with down from in march
