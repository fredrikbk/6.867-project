within sight of the winery where mr thomas works but the owners have always maintained an air of mystery about the place and locals play along napa is very welcoming to the growing waves of wine tasting tourists but not when it comes to screaming eagle the napa valley conference and visitors bureau wont provide a street address the winery can afford the stealth only an elite few get to buy screaming eagles cabernet the people on the winerys exclusive mailing list who pay &# for a bottle they can resell on the open market for &# or more depending on the vintage new york yankees manager joe torre is on the list as are innumerable doctors and dentists says one of the winerys owners a waiting list to get onto the mailing list is now about names long the winerys founder jean phillips

his business partner charles banks a santa barbara calif money manager "its going to be every bit as private as its ever been " says mr banks when a reporter visited mr banks he refused to let her

made just cases of her first vintage wine critic robert parker awarded her release a nearly perfect rating and screaming eagle scored instant cult wine status ms phillips resorted to a common cult wine practice she sold only to people on a mailing list with a limit of three bottles a year the list was full by she closed the waiting list after thousands of people had signed up ever since wine lovers have been trying to worm their way onto the list a letter writer pleaded for a bottle as a gift for a doctor who had treated him for cancer another begged to replace a bottle that he had broken "a lot of them i think are scams " says ms phillips who keeps boxes of these "begging" letters in storage "the first you believe but after you get of those you dont believe them any more " those who have made it onto the list are often elated one grateful buyer sent ms phillips a photo of his baby in a bassinet next to a bottle of screaming eagle sending updates with photos of the growing child each year another enclosed the photo of a west point cadet cradling a bottle at his graduation people who havent made it have sometimes tried to find the winery to beg their way onto the list but napa valley locals including the cashier at the oakville grocery the gas station attendant at a nearby chevron and fellow winery owners arent willing to give directions there is a gate at the entrance but no sign indicating that visitors are welcome to screaming eagle a rutted road leads to a modest one story house and small stone winery surrounded by gnarly oak trees and vineyards because ms phillips lived on the property for many years she says she "didnt want to have strangers creeping around " occasionally trespassing wine tourists were able to find the place and wander up to the front door where ms phillips long kept a shovel to ward off rattlesnakes one of ms phillipss ploys to keep strangers from picnicking on her property was to warn them about the snakes "if you cant even get to the vineyard does it really exist " asks scott w lewis a silicon valley entrepreneur who paid to attend a &# a head tasting last year of screaming eagle wines put on by organizers that arent affiliated with the winery it took seven months for them to acquire all vintages of screaming eagle mostly from private collectors paying an average of &# a bottle at that same tasting which took place in carmel calif at the th anniversary of the masters of food &amp wine a group of top sommeliers and others were so eager for a sip or two that they stood behind the roped off area of the event once the official tasters had left the wannabes slipped past the rope and polished off the dregs last september a german speaking couple driving a rental car managed to find the unmarked turnoff and drive up the dusty road past the gate which is usually locked "it was like theyd found the promised land " recalls screaming eagles winemaker andy erickson who turned them away the new owners will keep making screaming eagle in small quantities or cases a year since buying the winery in march they have been flooded with more than faxed phoned and emailed requests from people hoping that the change of

pleas for the wine screaming eagles winemaker mr erickson says he has been hit up by every preschool group public school and local charity in the area hoping that hell donate a bottle or two for their
