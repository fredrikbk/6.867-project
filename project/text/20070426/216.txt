the sarbox monster the debate over whether the united states is losing its competitiveness in global capital markets and thus might consider reforms of the sarbanes oxley statute and other laws and regulations has settled into a handful of arguments one camp led with great skill by nyse group ceo john thain points out that of the largest global ipos in were not listed on u s exchanges a second group advocating doing nothing in response led not surprisingly by academics points out that the u s started losing its ipo share in the late s well before sarbanes oxley and that in any event we should welcome the growth increased transparency and deeper liquidity emerging around the world allies in this "stay the course" camp include sarbanes oxley defenders like former sec chairman arthur levitt who point out that with the dow at an all time high reverse lbo ipos reaching a top last year and the u s economy humming along with a unemployment rate the regulators in their genius must actually have increased the competitiveness of u s markets by "increasing investor confidence " both sides are missing a key point it is not only the share of u s ipos that has been dropping precipitously but particularly in the small cap emerging growth sector it is also the absolute number that has fallen off the cliff consider the following throughout the s not just during the bubble at the end of the decade there were an average of technology ipos per year in the u s for the last six years the average has been per year in total across all industry sectors venture backed ipos have dropped from an average of per year during the s to per year in the last six years this has serious long term implications for three decades venture capital backed startup companies have been the job creating engine of the u s economy according to a study by the consulting firm global insight released by the national venture capital association nvca last month firms backed by venture capital since today employ million americans and in generated sales of &# trillion thats right these companies employ over of the u s private sector work force and account for an astounding of gdp this is astounding when you consider that the &# billion invested by venture capitalists in represented only of gdp talk about bang for your buck these companies from apple intel cisco amgen fedex home depot and google to the up and coming mobile technology and lifesaving drug and device companies of today have generated far higher than average wage growth have accounted for a significant and growing proportion of u s civilian r&amp d and have spawned some of the most innovative products services and business models of our era today however we are killing that job creating engine with a combination of high transaction costs and tremendous friction that is hampering our capital markets particularly the nasdaq these problems are the unintended consequences of a bevy of regulations each of which seemed like a good idea at the time but in total have turned out to be a disaster the first was the decimalization of the nasdaq which ironically was promulgated by the nasd itself convinced as it was that its broker dealers were making too much on commissions next came the secs regulation full disclosure or "fd" for those in the trade followed closely by then new york attorney general eliot spitzers "global settlement " which separated investment banking from equity research and made certain that a research analysts pay could not be a function of his involvement in winning investment banking business for his wall street firm in combination these three steps wrung all the economics out of nasdaq market making and small cap sell side equity research and the result was predictable the top firms on wall street dropped more than of the companies for which they previously provided market making and wrote equity research today of the stocks trading on the nasdaq have one equity research analyst or fewer covering them and have none that giant sucking sound is the exodus of sell side research analysts leaving to provide proprietary research for hedge funds the granddaddy of them all has of course been sarbanes oxley at the time of passage the official estimate of the cost of compliance with its now infamous section was &# per company in reality even tiny companies with &# or &# million or less in revenues are incurring up to &# and &# million in incremental expense just to comply with the blizzard of paperwork and documentation required by even the accounting industry ironically the prime beneficiary of sarbanes oxleys high cost has estimated average compliance cost at just under &# million per company but in my experience this estimate is low not surprisingly the combination of the absolute abandonment of small cap research and market making by underwriting firms and radically higher costs for small cap issuing companies has substantially raised the bar for the size of company that can go public on todays nasdaq as recently as the average deal size of a nasdaq ipo was &# million and the average market capitalization was &# million ten years later the average ipo deal size was &# million and the average market cap was over &# million a size that only a much bigger company can sustain some of this is the inevitable byproduct of the spectacular crash of the late s technology bubble during which it was clear that some companies went public too early but consider this when intel went public in it offered &# million of stock and sported a market value of &# million ciscos ipo in raised only &# million at a price which yielded a post deal market cap at ipo of &# million e trades initial offering raised &# million in at a market value of just &# million the point is that these companies created the majority of their value and the jobs that came with that value after they were public today they sport market caps of &# billion &# billion and &# billion respectively and employ among them hundreds of thousands of people today none of these deals would be doable the offering and overall market value of the firms would be too small for most underwriters the more likely outcome is that they would be sold in fact again for the last six years running of all the exits from venture backed companies have been through m&amp a transactions instead of through the ipo market which accounted for well over half of the exits in the s this is the real competitiveness issue the evidence suggests that we are now killing our most promising companies our future "national champions " before their time studies performed by the venture capital faculty at the harvard business school professors josh lerner bill sahlman and felda hardymon suggest several things about the u s venture capital model their work shows that the majority of the big investment returns generated by the vc industry in the past three decades was contributed by a relatively small number of the best firms and that the substantial majority of the gains came from a relatively small number of big winners importantly the vast majority of the gains generated by those big winners came after they were public this will not happen in the future if our most promising companies are sold to larger entities just as they are showing revenue and customer traction and reaching maturity does anyone seriously believe cisco would have grown more if it had been acquired by digital equipment or that microsoft would have thrived inside ibm yet that is the bet we are implicitly making today no one will shed any tears over the fact that the death of the small cap ipo will mean lower returns for venture capitalists but here is how the food chain works by definition it will also mean less company creation less job growth and less innovation in the united states to be sure it is not only the condition of the capital markets that will determine the future competitiveness of the united states not to worry the startup economy is increasingly being affected by equally idiotic regulatory and legislative decisions on other fronts at a time of increased global competition for talented scientists and engineers our government has slapped a disastrously low limit on the number of h b visas it grants to talented people from other countries who want to study and stay here as this newspaper reported the visa cap for fiscal year was exhausted in a matter of hours on april when these slots were made available thats right high tech high growth employers have access to no more visas for their best foreign workers through sept the governments investment in basic r&amp d which has spawned innovation in areas from biomedical science to high performance computing to materials science is under relentless budgetary pressure mainly due to the unrestrained growth of entitlement spending and our k educational system remains on a path that will not produce enough math and science teachers math and science students or knowledge economy workers but the crisis in our small cap capital markets is the problem most addressable today fortunately sec chairman chris cox a venture capital lawyer before he became a congressman and now regulator seems attuned to the problem and is advocating some initial cost saving reforms specifically he has been championing the process whereby the sec and the public company accounting oversight board will issue guidance regarding the implementation of sarbanes oxley section the point is to clarify what is and is not material and what will bring some sanity to the process of outside auditors attesting to the adequacy of a companys financial controls as things stand today no one is objecting to the sarbox requirement that ceos and cfos sign statements verifying the truthfulness of the companys reported statements what is causing the outcry is a requirement that tiny companies provide shelf after shelf of process oriented paperwork at the cost of millions of dollars that no investor is even likely to read nasdaq has a role to play here too and surprisingly has been asleep at the switch "the stock market for the next years" is watching its main business of listing innovative companies evaporate the exchange should step forward in a much more forceful way than it has to date to offer a solution to the research and market making problem one simple idea why not make it a benefit of a nasdaq listing that an issuing company is guaranteed at least one piece of research nasdaq could contract with an independent party to write the research moodys morningstar or some such i dont think young companies would mind the modest increase in listing fees such a plan would ensure that any nasdaq company had at least one estimate of its future revenue and earnings published for the investing public for years venture capital and startups have been the goose that laid the golden egg for the u s economy the availability of risk capital has been one of the most important factors contributing to the strong u s economic performance in this period today we are unwittingly killing that goose this is the real competitiveness issue mr grady who runs the venture capital arm of the carlyle group has just completed his term as the chairman of the national venture capital association
