songs of the civil rights era mavis staples takes us there the bowery presents mavis staples apollo theater new york may ties were skinny pants were still primarily menswear and television pictures were black and white it was the early s and the evening news delivered stark disturbing images that focused on the same color scheme blacks being hosed and beaten and marching in growing numbers blacks and whites singing together pulling courage from the lyrics of songs like "we shall overcome" when there was no guarantee that would actually happen "those songs of the civil rights movement came from the church " says mavis staples whose voice held the lead position in the famed family group the staple singers and whose latest album "well never turn back " revisits many of those gospel based protest anthems its an exciting and vital recording that is easily one of the most consistent of her career with profound personal significance for the year old singer ms staples recalls touring the south in the early s and the role played by such songs as "eyes on the prize " "down in mississippi" and others on her new cd "they were spirituals and gospel songs that they put freedom lyrics to like that one song that was famous for the sit ins theyd be trying to put you in the paddy wagon and wed lock our arms together and" she breaks into song "we shall not we shall not be moved like a tree thats planted by the water we shall not be moved " to hear ms staples start singing in mid conversation even through a telephone from her native chicago is a familiar pleasure the signature huskiness of her voice and the distinctive breathy way she punctuates the rhythm instantly call to mind those joyful message songs the staple singers placed on the pop charts in the "ill take you there " "respect yourself " "heavy makes you happy" with its giddy sing along refrain "sha na boom boom yeah " they were uplifting memorable tunes that successfully updated the groups church spun harmonies for the soul era yielding eight top hits for the group originally formed by roebuck "pops" staples in with his son pervis and daughters cleotha yvonne and his youngest mavis "when we began in our little home in chicago i was years old still singing songs from kindergarten a turkey is a funny bird wobble wobble wobble and all he knows is one word gobble gobble gobble pops had been singing with an all male gospel group the trumpet jubilees but these guys wouldnt come to rehearsal one night he came home pulled out a little guitar called us into the living room and sat us on the floor in a circle he said ill just sing with my children the first song he taught us ill never forget will the circle be unbroken " the combination of pops stapless delta blues guitar riffs his velvet smooth tenor and the sweet harmonies of his children proved an instant hit with chicago congregations when perviss voice broke in mavis took over singing lead "for some reason i could reach the highs and the lows my voice was really heavy as a kid " says ms staples by the mid s with an accent on gospel songs that felt down home and were usually sung in slower tempos the popular staple singers sound was born "pops gave us the harmonies that he and his brothers and sisters sang down in mississippi where he was born we didnt know that it was country we just sang what he gave us and he would say take your time make it plain dont rush it because those up tempo songs seemed like they were fun but the slow tempos were serious and said we want you to take this in " five decades later ms staples is the only family member to have enjoyed an active solo career to the present day though less known than other gospel shaped singers of her generation shes considered an r&amp b diva on a par with aretha franklin patti labelle and gladys knight shes released eight solo albums and recorded with legends from a wide range of musical worlds from ray charles bob dylan and prince to marty stuart the band and her childhood idol gospel pioneer mahalia jackson ms staples has had a life rich with musical triumphs and social trials she tells a lengthy story of being chased by west memphis police after a racist encounter in spending the night in jail and spying the police chief attending the groups next memphis concert she speaks of meeting bob dylan when both were in their early s and the relationship that ensued "pops i want to marry mavis " she recalls him yelling across a crowded backstage room at a folk festival her fathers response "what are you telling me for tell mavis " the staple singers were among the first black groups to ignore lines of color and record socially conscious songs written by young whites like dylan "a hard rains gonna fall" and stephen stills "for what its worth" it was dylans songwriting in particular that profoundly influenced ms stapless father and "we began writing freedom songs like march up freedoms highway that was about the march from selma to montgomery alabama then we wrote long walk to d c about the march on washington and why am i treated so bad which we would sing before dr martin luther king jr would speak that was his favorite he would say now mavis youre going to sing my song tonight right " ms staples weaves a number of personal experiences into the "well never turn back" cd "reverend martin told us what needed to be done and if he can preach it we can sing it help to make the new day come " she sings on the song "my own eyes " over the closing vamp of "down in mississippi " she relates a childhood visit to see relatives and how too young to understand signs segregating public facilities she unwittingly "integrated a washeteria " "that just happened in the studio " says ms staples of her impromptu storytelling "doing the album took me back and it just felt right i follow my feeling but ry cooder and i we did sit down before and choose songs there was a plan " mr cooders role as producer for ms staples is surprising only in that had not happened until now he produced pop stapless grammy winning solo album "father father" in the producer and ms staples met for the first time at the awards gala mr cooders expressive slide guitar a contrasting voice to ms stapless contralto and his mandolin playing add texture and a deep roots feel to the album his deep love of the blues comes through in his choice of j b lenoirs "down in mississippi" as the albums opening track and his penchant for cross cultural matchups like his work with havanas buena vista social club led to a variety of musical support the rich harmonies of the zulu gospel choir ladysmith black mambazo actually open the album while the still active freedom singers originally formed in to support the civil rights struggle provided both an important historical connection and the albums grimmest track "we had just finished lunch at the studio and all of a sudden they started singing in the mississippi river and i could feel chills going over it was so eerie i asked them to explain it and its about when they were dragging the river for those three freedom fighters andrew goodman michael werner and james chaney they were pulling up other bodies they werent looking for so thats the counting part of the song one it could be your son two it could be me or you " on may and mr cooder drummer jim keltner and the freedom singers will join ms staples for a special concert at new yorks apollo theater as an exercise in looking back "well never turn back" could easily have slipped into gloom and despair songs that were once sung with optimistic determination according to ms staples now require a darker more realistic sensibility to acknowledge how little has changed since the civil rights era "today theres still a need to sing these songs because listen its still here racism is still here for the most part we let it be but then you see it in the news a policeman shooting a young black man times you see katrina putting people in a stadium with no water and my heart went out it took me back to those water hoses and the billy clubs " all great music somehow carries the same sense of emotional balance as life itself sadness and hope anger and love "well never turn back" is an excellent example of a great singer finally creating a fully realized statement time may judge differently but for now this album serves as mavis stapless magnum opus a musical autobiography that rocks and sways and delivers an ageless message mr kahn is the author of "the house that trane built the story of impulse records" w w norton
