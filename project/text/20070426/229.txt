unwanted suitor raises the stakes in fight for abn rbs led group makes &# billion proposal holders apply pressure a bidding battle has broken out in what will be the worlds largest banking takeover with four of europes largest banks in a two way contest to acquire abn amro holding nv of the netherlands the tussle began just this week but already has involved some of the most aggressive deal making tactics seen in years yesterday abn which had agreed to be acquired by british bank barclays plc for &# billion in stock received an unwelcome &# billion takeover approach from a consortium led by royal bank of scotland group plc but to pull off what would be the biggest banking deal ever rbs would need to break up two takeover agreements abns pact to be sold to barclays and abns unusual side deal to sell its lasalle bank unit in chicago to bank of america corp for &# billion in cash the rbs group said its proposed offer which would be paid in cash and with rbs shares was conditioned on abn finding a way to keep lasalle despite these hurdles no one is counting out rbs with a market value of about &# billion it is bigger than barclays or abn which both have a market value of around &# billion rbs also has a history of audacious deal making late last night london time abn said it would provide the consortium with the same financial details of its operations as it had provided to barclays amid growing shareholder demands that it do so rbs chief executive fred goodwin said earlier in the day that if given such access he would be able to move quickly with a formal bid rbs declined to disclose how it would fund an offer last night abn ceo rijkman groenink held a meeting by phone with the three ceos from the rbs led group which also includes banco santander central hispano sa of spain and dutch belgian bank fortis nv but they made little progress on the call according to people briefed on the conversation time is crucial because abns deal to sell lasalle becomes permanent after may the chance to acquire lasalle is a key reason why rbs is interested in abn abns shareholders increasingly hedge funds that bought shares once the bank disclosed it was for sale several weeks ago are starting to mobilize to try to force abn to seek the highest possible price the rbs groups takeover proposal is valued at about more than abns deal with barclays in considering a takeover abn like any dutch company must consider issues beyond getting the highest price for shareholders such as how its employees customers and other stakeholders are treated and the banks position in the netherlands the banks employees have taken a similar stance through their staff council which also opposes a complete breakup of abn that argument may have worked in the past in continental europe but today pressure from shareholders which increasingly include hedge funds and other high powered investors has never been greater to maximize their returns the childrens investment fund management known as tci one of londons largest hedge funds and holder of just under a stake in abn said the banks board should be open to a higher bid and that the lasalle deal should be scrapped abns mr groenink has said repeatedly that he doesnt want the sprawling year old bank broken up he sought the deal with barclays largely because barclays promised to keep abn intact to shield that friendly deal he agreed in a surprise move over just four days to sell abns lasalle bank to bank of america for a price about above abns own estimates abn on sunday debated internally until just hours before announcing the lasalle deal whether it had to allow shareholders a separate vote on the sale it ultimately decided no vote would be required people familiar with the matter said the rbs group by contrast intends to divvy up abns global businesses rbs which is based in edinburgh scotland would acquire lasalle and abns london based wholesale and investment banking division according to people familiar with the matter banco santander would acquire abns banco real in brazil and other latin american divisions in addition to banca antonveneta spa of italy and other italian assets fortis would assume the dutch banking franchise rbs hopes to merge lasalle into its own growing u s banking franchise lasalle has retail locations and atms in chicago and its suburbs it also has commercial operations in states and cities across the u s one option for the rbs group is to bid for lasalle first but make that bid conditional on acquiring the rest of abn such a strategy would require abns support however because its contract with bank of america says abn can accept a rival bid for lasalle if it is better for all abn shareholders rbs could argue that because it would be bidding for all of abn at a higher price than the barclays deal any bid for lasalle would be better for all abn shareholders even if the bid was lower than bank of americas yesterday abn and bank of america executives said their deal couldnt be unwound because of the strict wording of the sales contract signed by the two companies "there is no way that we can see" to break it said abn management board member huibert boumeester in an interview yesterday bank of america chairman and chief executive kenneth d lewis told shareholders that the company was going full steam ahead with its plan to acquire lasalle mr lewis was encouraged when rbs didnt immediately file a court challenge to bank of americas contract an executive close to him said another executive added that mr lewis would be reluctant to raise his bid but also reluctant to lose the chicago bank late tuesday night under pressure from shareholders abn released the full contract of its lasalle agreement many lawyers bankers and hedge fund managers stayed up poring through the page document looking for loopholes that could allow abn to terminate the sale of lasalle abns mr groenink in a statement yesterday said the only way the rival consortium could get lasalle is by making two bids one for lasalle and another for the rest of the bank "everyone should realize that this is actually a very good structure for shareholders as it maximizes the price we get for lasalle as well as for the rest of the group " he said but shareholders didnt see it that way "you cannot create poison pills and at the same time tell people that you are open to other offers we always hope that a deal will be friendly but rbs has a good track record in integrating hostile acquisitions " said tom shrager a director at tweedy browne co which holds about in abn stock at toscafund asset management llp a london hedge fund that owns about of abn chairman george mathewson who preceded mr goodwin as ceo of rbs also wants abn to go with rbs "i think its a great deal for rbs and i think its a great deal for abn amro shareholders " he said yesterday at rbss annual meeting in edinburgh "im very supportive of the bid " another tactic would be for shareholders to sue abn management and supervisory board in court claiming they didnt do their fiduciary duty in securing the best offer for shareholders activist hedge fund tci was preparing filings yesterday as of yesterday however no cases had been filed in the dutch enterprise court in amsterdam which presides over corporate disputes valerie bauerlein in charlotte n c contributed to
