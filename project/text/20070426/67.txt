first we need to find out who the rich people really are are the rich paying the majority of tax "the taxpaying minority" by ari fleischer editorial page april the latest data released by the irs is for filers of tax returns with adjusted gross incomes of &# or more representing filings paid of the total income tax filers with adjusted gross incomes agis of between &# and &# representing filings paid of the total income tax there is no way of knowing whether any of these people are rich or not rich because tax returns require only the reporting of one subset of wealth taxable income according to the spectrem group there are households in the u s with a net worth of greater than &# million excluding their primary residence these are the rich there are more than million households with agis of greater than &# of which are not rich in the income tax was responsible for just of the governments tax revenue social security taxes generated of the governments tax revenue since social security taxes are income limited the same million plus taxpayers in the &# to &# group who are shouldering the majority of the income tax burden are also shouldering most of the social security tax burden stephen r meyer lakewood colo as mr fleisher points out anyone making more than &# a year is among the top of earners who pay of all income taxes i have many friends in manhattan making much more money than that who struggle to make ends meet and who oppose tax cuts for "the rich " like the frog who doesnt realize hes being cooked they do not realize that they are "the rich " barry milliken new york ari fleischers comment "at the end of the day everyone in this country is in it together we have an obligation to help the neediest among us and the wealthy should pay more" is the essence of the flawed and irrational logic that got us a tax system where "one percent takes in less than of the countrys income but pays almost of the countrys income tax " this is the kind of collectivist thinking that redistributes wealth in a way that ends up harming the very people the politicians and ari fleischers of the world claim they are trying to help no individual has the "obligation" to help any other as humans we have the desire to help others it is our nature that makes us want to do so it makes us feel good and gives us a sense of purpose and meaning i look for ways to help others but not because i feel i have an "obligation" to do so i do it because i like to when the government takes over this role it performs it in a wasteful and harmful manner simply look at the standard of living of people throughout the world where there is a high level of freedom protection of civil rights and limited government control and regulation the "poor" have a better life than the "wealthy" in countries where the government controls nearly every aspect of a persons life and attempts to redistribute wealth it is morally wrong to take someones property to give it to another if i entered my neighbors house and under force took his television to give to a "needy" person i would be arrested and jailed when the government does the same thing through taxation we mistakenly think it is different and that it is justified greg camia atlanta yes the rich are paying more in taxes but their share of national income is rising exponentially as this trend continues tax percentages will shift predictably following a pattern that resembles mr fleischers carefully chosen statistics but nowhere does he discuss other more sinister injustices that result as more of our national wealth is shifted to the wealthy such as a diminishing middle class and the ballooning national debt talk about a redistribution of wealth instead mr fleischer simply whines about more rich people paying taxes in mr fleischers closing argument he suggests that a worker making &# a year who pays &# for medicare has a "better deal" than someone making &# million a year who pays &# he uses "cars" as a comparable commodity setting aside the dramatic differences in quality of medical care that rich people receive vs the poor lets compare something a little more basic and relevant such as housing a worker making &# a year might be able to afford &# a month for rent and still have enough to barely feed his family while living in squalid and desperate circumstances someone making &# million a year is very likely paying &# a month or more for housing has no trouble feeding his family sends his kids to the best private schools and anticipates a very comfortable retirement now tell me again mr fleischer who should be paying more for medicare stephen b jennings palo alto calif
