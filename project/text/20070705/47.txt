how maker of stents for kids ran afoul of fda hopkinton n y to doctors who treat babies with congenital heart defects allen tower is the go to guy for years mr towers little company numed inc has made and delivered cardiological devices within hours to treat infants and small children who could have died if their aortas hadnt been widened or their heart valves opened but a run in with the food and drug administration is making it more difficult for mr tower to deliver his custom made catheters and therapeutic balloons and stents even though the government hasnt questioned the safety of the companys devices doctors world wide are worried that the devices could become even harder to get if the criminal investigation conducted by the fda with federal prosecutors in delaware results in a large fine against numed or other steps that could hamper the companys ability to sell the devices if that happens many doctors and hospitals would have to treat their young patients with devices designed for adults physicians say those devices can be less safe than numeds meanwhile more than cardiologists and parents in the u s and countries from south africa to slovenia and sweden have signed a petition urging u s authorities to be lenient the petition says action against the company could cause "a devastating loss to patients should mr tower be relieved of his freedom or ability to continue his work " william e hellenbrand chief of pediatric cardiology at new york presbyterian hospital columbia calls mr tower "by far the best person in the world to supply devices for children with congenital defects you tell him what you need and in hours he gives you a prototype " the numed case offers a window into a crucial dilemma involving pediatric heart devices infants have tiny hearts and arteries in which adult devices are at best clumsy and at worst dangerous moreover heart deformities vary so much from child to child that its difficult to perform a large clinical trial to test pediatric devices the fda normally insists on large studies in which scores or hundreds of patients are randomly assigned to a new therapy and others receive standard care or a placebo partly as a result big companies have shied away from producing pediatric heart devices the fda says it has regulations that allow doctors to get unapproved pediatric devices if necessary but the agencys director of device evaluation ron yustein says "i dont feel comfortable saying whether the regulations work or not " many doctors say that in pediatric cardiology the rules dont work well these specialists say that because of the heightened fda scrutiny in the numed case u s doctors now often have to use adult devices in children or else direct families to europe to get treatment "the real problem is that the procedures dont go as well" when adult devices are used says james e lock the chief cardiologist at childrens hospital boston numed and a few other companies make the pediatric devices the fda has approved some for sale but not others some are used legally by doctors "off label " meaning for a use the fda hasnt specified some are adult devices used off label for children or theyre allowed by federal loopholes including the "custom device exemption " in which otherwise unapproved devices can be employed in individual cases of dire need the devices in the numed case are approved for sale in europe but not in the u s doctors and others familiar with the matter say numed ran afoul of the maze of intricate fda marketing regulations essentially mr tower failed to file proper documents with the fda in a number of cases in wilmington del before "i stretched it ill admit " he says in an interview the diminutive mr tower years old seems an improbable figure in a criminal case at feet inches he tells corny jokes he culls from the readers digest he grew up in this hamlet near the canadian border where he runs his &# million employee business in a former schoolhouse hes a high school graduate who played on the schools basketball team "i lied about my height " he says he went to college for a bit more than a year but didnt graduate a chance job at a new jersey chemical company years ago taught him how to make catheters occasionally turning to local butcher shops for research and gold jewelers for materials mr tower built his business by delivering devices fast to doctors in emergencies many doctors tell stories about mr tower going the extra mile michael tynans involves two special order balloons he needed in a week to open up a heart valve in a fetus in the mothers womb dr tynan now emeritus professor of pediatric cardiology at kings college london says mr tower called him back two hours after the order was placed "the first ones made " mr tower said "theyll both be on the plane tomorrow morning " "allen towers greatest asset is his biggest problem " says charles e mullins emeritus professor of pediatrics at baylor college of medicine "he doesnt know how to say no " mr towers troubles stem from events that occurred through in wilmington where his customers included cardiologists at the dupont hospital for children he delivered more than stents to two doctors there the devices in this instance were as is often the case with pediatric devices not approved by the fda for general sale but according to a hospital report to the fda a doctor sometimes termed the cases emergencies and numed supplied them as "custom devices " one family complained to the hospital that it hadnt given its consent for the use of unapproved devices ultimately three families filed lawsuits against the hospital the doctors and numed alleging that they werent told the device used in their children was unapproved and that their children had suffered physical injuries as a result the hospital eventually fired the two doctors and concluded in the report to the fda that doctors "did not comply with patient protection procedures " the doctors attorney didnt respond to calls seeking comment the fda appears to have concluded that doctors at the hospital were using such devices too often and so actual marketing was involved instead of exceptions for emergencies the fda has told mr tower he needed to file documents with the agency for specific approval each time a device was sold as a "custom device " according to people familiar with the inquiry mr tower concedes he may not have filed proper documents with the fda for each individual case in the delaware matter the devices in question range in cost from &# to &# each but people who know mr tower dont believe money was a key motivator "this didnt happen because allen tower wanted to make a fortune " says larry latson director of the congenital cardiac catheterization lab at the cleveland clinic "most of the time he forgets to charge thats the way he is " ziyad hijazi director of the congenital heart center at rush medical center in chicago says he now has to sew his own makeshift stents because fda enforcement has made it too cumbersome to get them expeditiously from numed the fda generally doesnt regulate the practice of medicine "now in an extreme emergency i cannot spend half an hour sewing a stent and i will have to send the child to open heart surgery " dr hijazi says to many like dr latson the numed case highlights the pitfalls of what he calls "terrible" fda rules he says families who can afford it now often go to europe to get therapy he even tells of a case where a child died of a ruptured aorta because a certain type of numed teflon covered metal stent couldnt be used because of the fdas scrutiny of the company "the fda wants more data yet there are few patients to acquire the data " dr latson says "the fdas system does not work well for fields like ours where there are small numbers of widely varying patients " mr tower and his company are negotiating with federal prosecutors over possible charges that he marketed unapproved stents used in children the investigation could lead to a multimillion dollar fine and limits on mr towers ability to do business the u s attorney could in theory ban the sale of some devices a possibility that concerns doctors most people familiar with the case say its unlikely that mr tower will be charged with a felony but that could change see related letter "letters to
