home &amp family cranky consumer shopping online for household basics we search for deals and convenience a leaky container these days if youre filling a prescription or buying shampoo you probably wont have to travel far the nations two leading pharmacy chains walgreens and cvs have more than stores spread collectively throughout the country big retailers like wal mart costco and supermarket chains have also long peddled prescriptions and personal care items so why would anyone need to buy toilet paper online try asking of that of those who shop for everything from toothpaste to razor blades on the web or to the merchants that cater to them the boom in buying essentials on the web is fueled by distinct types of consumers those in urban areas who travel by foot or public transportation like having bulky items shipped directly to their doors and those seeking specialty products an unusual shade of hair coloring a nearly extinct brand of mouthwash are often able to find such items more easily online bargain seekers are also in the online hunt still we were skeptical is it that hard running to the corner for a few necessities versus navigating web sites and then waiting for the ups guy to show up with your mouthwash and how much are you actually paying for the convenience to find answers we put together a list of five basic items razors batteries toothpaste laundry detergent and toilet paper and went on a web buying spree note prices and selection can vary from day to day to measure the experience against the bricks and mortar version we picked up the same items at our closest wal mart seeing how it would stack up our verdict if saving money is your goal going online is rarely the best bet but we cant deny the fact that well never lug our essentials home again even if it just means emptying the car trunk without fondly recalling the day the ups guy arrived with a big cardboard box nonetheless not every online retailer stocks every common product at planetrx com which has no connection to a now defunct company of the same name from the late s we couldnt find our preferred brand of toilet paper scott the retailer stocked another cottonelle and we couldnt find any laundry detergent we didnt come up with a perfect match in the toothpaste department either settling for a different version of our favorite brand arm &amp hammer a company spokesman says the site is looking to add more products because our order didnt hit the &# mark we werent eligible for free shipping meaning we had to fork over five bucks more that said the site is running a promotion offering off your first order and it offers a variety of health and beauty tips want to soothe your tired feet soak them in a basin of warm water and three tea bags the drugstore chains that have ventured online we shopped at walgreens com and cvs com have similar consumer advice features but unlike planetrx they fill prescriptions they also have a better selection of products at both walgreens and cvs we were able to match four of the five items with slight modifications walgreens didnt have our four pack of gillette razor cartridges but did sell the razor itself with starter cartridges cvs carried the scott toilet paper but in a quantity of rather than our preferred six and both retailers offered free shipping or discounts of one sort or another depending on the amount of your purchase at cvs we were able to take advantage of free shipping and a &# e coupon discount bringing our total cost lower than what we might have paid at the store but when our purchase from walgreens arrived we learned another lesson some products may not make the journey intact our bottle of tide detergent was leaking fortunately it was protected in a plastic bag and it took two calls to the company to sort out the matter we were finally issued a refund with ebay we had mixed results we couldnt find a seller who carried all the products we wanted so we ended up paying multiple shipping charges and in one case the fee was more than the product itself sure it seemed like we got a good deal on that arm &amp hammer toothpaste we paid &# in a best offer auction a price well below retail but not when we added &# for shipping but the right product yielded the right deal we got our gillette razors for &# apiece with free shipping they easily go for around &# apiece elsewhere shopping on ebay of course isnt for everyone when we searched for "toilet paper " we came upon an offer for a roll imprinted with an image of nascar driver kurt buschs vehicle "display it proudly with your kurt busch collection " said the seller at drugstore com we came closest to the mark the web site resembles a kind of amazon com for the drugstore shopper with an impressive assortment of products some in all that meant we could speed through our list the scott toilet paper for example was available in every conceivable style scented colored you name it and quantity and the site has a good introductory offer free shipping with a &# minimum plus customers are eligible to earn back in "drugstore com dollars" on each total order with the exception of prescriptions gift cards and a few other items that meant we could shop in our underwear ah the glories of e commerce and still save money right wrong when we went to wal mart we found a notable difference in pricing on almost every item the arm &amp hammer toothpaste was &# versus &# at drugstore com the eight pack of duracell aa batteries was &# versus &# at cvs the tide laundry detergent well you get the picture and despite the sheer size of a wal mart location we didnt find the store any more difficult to navigate than some of the web sites we shopped in fact it took us about a third of the time to make our way through wal mart minutes not including the drive to and from the store than it did to slog through all the buying options on ebay then again wal mart didnt carry nascar toilet paper write to cranky wsj com store web site drugstore com www drugstore com price not as competitive as wal mart but not out of line either offers for free shipping and a rebate in "drugstore com dollars" help keep costs in line selection enormous you can find almost any product in any size or style plus you can track down some hard to find items we found all five items on our list comments we found our preferred brand of toilet paper in the right quantity but could have purchased that toilet paper in a pack at wal mart for almost the same price the wide selection is what really sets this site apart store web site ebay www ebay com price some real deals can be had we found pricing well below wal mart on batteries and razor cartridges but other items didnt make as much sense such as a &# purchase of a tube of toothpaste once shipping was factored in selection varies greatly we had no problem with shaving supplies but no success with our preferred brand of toilet paper we did pick up some laundry detergent but had to purchase it in a quantity of four bottles comments wed shop here again but only for key items such as batteries and razor cartridges where the bargains are plentiful store web site cvs www cvs com price higher than drugstore com we paid cents more for the toothpaste and &# more for the batteries but we got free shipping and took advantage of an e coupon that saved us &# selection respectable the only item we couldnt find was the tide laundry detergent but at least it was listed as just being out of stock plus as with drugstore com and walgreens site handles prescriptions by mail comments we could still use our in store cvs extracare rebate program online but we live close to a cvs so why not just head there unless you want to take advantage of "online exclusives" store web site walgreens www walgreens com price comparable with cvs in fact the companies charged the same for the toothpaste &# and batteries &# but because our order was under &# we didnt qualify for free shipping selection again on par with cvs though we were a bit stumped as to why at the time they sold the gillette razor handle but not cartridges they now carry both comments the bottle of laundry detergent arrived leaking and it took two calls to get a refund there are many walgreens near us so this didnt help make us online converts store web site planetrx www planetrx com price not very good we paid more here for the razor cartridges &# for a four pack than anywhere else and we didnt hit the minimum &# purchase to qualify for free shipping selection limited the site didnt have a single offering of laundry detergent and only one brand of toilet paper no prescription service either comments we probably wouldnt shop here again unless we lived somewhere very remote
