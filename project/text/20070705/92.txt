the daily fix venus williams fires blasts at on court and off court foes online edition what would wimbledon and the williams sisters be without a little drama on wednesday venus williams erased maria sharapova then took aim at critics whod charged that her sister serena milked a leg injury in her monday match against daniela hantuchova as covered in tuesdays fix venus was back in action today but the fix will stay quiet about that to avoid spoilers and leave room for tomorrow mornings columnists "part of wimbledons appeal is its quirky relationship between the sublime and the ridiculous and venus williams was a champion on both counts wednesday " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "her play was sublime and she went to war with the ridiculous " venus said she was appalled at her sisters critics and mr jenkins backs her up "first off to suggest that serena was just kidding when she crashed to the turf her left leg frozen by a muscle spasm is beyond preposterous similarly insane is the idea that serena milked her treatment during that eight minute break or that she stretched the standards of comportment after receiving more extensive treatment during a rain delay and returning to play " hampered by a injured thumb that took away her backhand serena was then beaten by justine henin in the boston globe bud collins chronicles how venus has found her shot in time for a title run "her reformed forehand was magnificent as were numerous of the duels with sharapova killer exchanges that roused the full house gathering of and usually went to venus she was running brilliantly allowing the russian points on only her best shots sharapova who was against venus and beat her at key biscayne fla in march sighed i wasnt thinking shed play great but i wasnt surprised shes capable of it " on the mens side the lasting tale so far is the five days it took no ranked rafael nadal to beat the weather and no ranked robin soderling the two wont be exchanging christmas cards mr soderling expressed his annoyance with mr nadals on court tics by imitating them pumped his fist after a lucky shot instead of offering the usual apologetic wave and afterwards the two fell to complaining about each other nadal "i say hello to him seven times to his face he never answers " soderling "i think i had to wait for him like times every point i had to wait for him i think all players play faster than him " in usa today christine brennan joins the chorus of critics and players wondering why the two couldnt play sunday "if this were any other tournament they would have played sunday which except for a brief shower was a beautiful day but the crusty traditionalists who run the all england club unwisely defied the heavens and clung to their grand plan to give everyone sunday off even as they should have known that more storm clouds were brewing i find that a little incredible knowing what was coming next nadal said with an eye on the doppler radar that the lords of wimbledon must not yet recognize " mr nadals nemesis roger federer was back in action today for the first time since friday a layoff that led to this joking complaint from andy roddick "weve been stuck in a locker room for nine hours a day and hes been chilling out taking the double decker bus red thing tour maybe " tiger woods tees off this afternoon at congressional country club in bethesda md the start of his at&amp t national tournament for charity in the washington post thomas boswell urges sports fans to "play hooky call in sick blow up your plans this event with the best golfer who ever lived with five of the top six players in the world on one of the most magnificent courses in america may be this towns best sports value of my lifetime " sticking with the post sally jenkins reflects on tigers uncharacteristically open meet and greet with the media on tuesday "it was nice to finally meet tiger woods " she writes "maybe it was sleep deprivation or lingering euphoria from the birth of his first child or the exposing act of putting his name on a golf tournament that made him so forthcoming usually woods in conversation is an exercise in verbal gridlock but what he gave up yesterday while not exactly a session on oprahs couch was for him almost confessional he actually told us a few things about himself he made a joke he was someone we might like if we knew him better " but if youre thinking thats the start of a syrupy portrait think again "ultimately of course woods is nothing close to a regular guy if there was a major revelation in the news conference it was the striking and inescapable fact that woods had the icy sangfroid to play four days of championship golf with his pregnant wife in a hospital the weekend duffer might be incapable of hitting a shot under those circumstances but once woodss wife and her doctor assured him she wasnt in danger get the w she urged him woods maintained his concentration and he came within a stroke of winning tying for second " you might not think theres any connection between pitching and establishing a vineyard but tom seaver would disagree in the los angeles times ross newhan visits the hall of fame hurler on diamond mountain above the napa valley and finds him working hard and utterly content "seaver is experiencing the same creative vibes that he did on the mound " mr newhan writes adding "how often did a manager come to the mound with runners on base and the game on the line he recalled and ask him what pitch he intended to throw only to have seaver respond i made that decision yesterday " "in many ways what we are doing now in growing grapes is similar to what i did when pitching the organization the attention to detail between starts " seaver tells mr newhan "in many ways there is a sequential rhythm and analogous nature to the two seasons and im sure that was a large part of the attraction for me " its been said of young hitters in love with baseball that they live in the batting cage but with reggie willits of the los angeles angels its true as lee jenkins explains in the new york times mr willits and his wife amber decided to build a house on five acres in fort cobb okla and began by building the batting cage but they then realized they could save money from mr willits minor league salary by simply living in the cage "from the outside it looks like a warehouse feet long and feet wide " mr jenkins writes "but inside it has everything a baseball family would ever need a place to eat sleep and hit when houseguests open the front door they see a small bathroom and kitchen on the right and two sofas and a television set on the left the floors are covered with berber carpet the dining room table is adorned with a vase of flowers there are no closets toward the back the pitching machine the weight room and the master bedroom are clustered together when he wants to bat he pushes aside the sofas to form his personal playing field he steps inside the net suspended from the ceiling if amber is busy he hits off a tee " mr willits contributes a line that has to be considered a rather large understatement "i have an extremely supportive wife " tip of
