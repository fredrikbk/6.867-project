price tag expected to be close to euros or about &# for a basic model fiat didnt give an exact price range ahead of todays launch but fiat isnt bmw and the new steers europes fifth biggest car maker by volume away from the inexpensive small cars for which it is best known "im not a fan of introducing more low cost cars in europe " luca de meo chief executive of fiat group automobiles spa fiats auto unit said at a conference in prague last week "we did it for years and we went almost bankrupt " thanks to a revived vehicle line up fiats auto operations returned to profitability in after years of losses but to succeed with its it will have to convince customers that it is worth a bmw mini sized price despite being built on the same platform as fiats entry level panda mini model "i like the look of it " says alice giovannini a marketing executive in milan but price is still a factor she said "this is a fiat and it may not be the greatest quality car if its going to cost me euros i want everything in there air conditioning mp player all that stuff " fiat officials declined to comment for this article fiat is rolling out its entry in the market for hip upscale cars at a time when many of europes auto makers are seeking ways to bolster their lineup of models toyota motor corp and other asian auto makers are capturing an increasing share of the european market particularly for low

enough to do well in other markets " said mr whitwell fiat dominates the italian market making about one in every three new cars registered but some say fiat may find difficulty selling significant volumes of a premium priced mini in other markets "the crux of the discussion on the is price " says sanford c bernstein analyst stephen cheetham "will consumers think it is special enough to pay a premium versus all the other perfectly competent entry level cars on the market its possible in italy where the reserve of goodwill for fiat is strong but wed suspect its a lot tougher elsewhere " mr cheetham has a "sell" rating on fiat shares to contain production costs fiat is building the at a factory here near the czech border the company has been making cars in tychy since it made a deal with
