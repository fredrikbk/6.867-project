politics &amp economics giuliani support hints at shift emphasis on defense not social issues attracts some republicans des moines he is a pro choice thrice married new yorker so why is rudy giuliani the leading presidential candidate in a republican party long dominated by pro life family values voters in the south and west iowa state legislator mary lundby who calls herself a liberal republican offers one possibility "many republicans have questioned whether our entire party focus should be on social issues " says ms lundby who has signed onto mr giulianis iowa presidential campaign as a co chairwoman this year she is increasingly hearing from republicans whose greater interest is the economy or national defense she says "is it a groundswell no " she concedes "but we didnt get where we are in a day either " dont look for the party to make a sudden leap to the middle or to turn its back on its religious and social conservatives but mr giulianis lead in the polls and in the latest round of fund raising according to new reports tuesday may hint at the declining clout of those voters and their issues within the republican party and perhaps a shift back toward a more libertarian emphasis if so mr giulianis candidacy could be helping to redefine the republican party just as ronald reagans did in when pundits initially dismissed mr reagan as too conservative for his partys mainstream former iowa republican rep james leach now sees the party divided between "individual rights conservatives versus social issue conservatives this is an exceptionally interesting phenomenon " he adds he himself earned the enmity of the religious right in after he criticized it for attacking his opponent over gay rights and he lost his seat he hasnt endorsed any candidate yet in the race there are other reasons for mr giulianis lead of course the war in iraq and spending scandals in washington focus on mr giulianis perceived strengths fiscally conservative and hawkish on national security "different issues come to the forefront at different times those are his issues and those are the times " says jeff lamberti an iowa republican party official who has endorsed arizona sen john mccain it is also still early in the campaign cycle and mr giulianis nomination is far from assured he hasnt defied the religious right as much as he has skirted social issues that are important to them by promising for example to appoint "strict constructionist" judges a term often used as code for jurists who would favor curbs on abortion only of republican and republican leaning voters could identify him as the pro choice candidate in a recent pew research center poll even those who said abortion is "very important" to them werent aware of his stand that wont last long mr giulianis republican opponents all are running on pro life platforms the same week mr giuliani was in des moines recently kansas sen sam brownback was making his own swing through eastern iowa where he talked in passing about immigration a flat tax and cancer research but what his audience clearly wanted to hear about was mr brownbacks opposition to abortion an issue he compared to slavery as "a moral struggle " "we gotta get life right we got to get marriage right " he told a small but wildly cheering crowd mr giulianis campaign also has benefited from the lack of a prominent southern social conservative in the race although that would change with the expected entry of former tennessee sen fred thompson in the latest wall street journal nbc news poll mr giuliani leads the republican field but with only compared with for mr thompson quarterly fund raising reports released this week show mr giuliani also led in the three months ended june raising &# million for the nomination contest ahead of former massachusetts gov mitt romneys &# million and mr mccains &# million in the first quarter mr romney bested the former new york mayor on this front in iowa a des moines register poll of likely iowa caucus goers who tend by a wide margin to be conservative shows mr romney ahead of mr giuliani to but those same voters ranked terrorism and national security as their leading concerns above sixth place abortion mr giuliani regularly tells audiences that "keeping america on offense against terrorism" is his first concern a line that draws applause and refocuses attention on his national security stance but he is also now honing his message on the economy where his record is less well known in a speech in des moines recently he tackled such nitty gritty as government accounting methods "this is the way a president has to think " he told the rapt audience after explaining how he would save &# billion a year by trimming the federal work force he also disarmingly gives audiences permission to disagree with him on some issues a trait rarely evinced during his mayoral terms but still support his campaign "i dont agree with us on everything " he regularly adds that message appeals to republicans who fear a drubbing if the party focuses too narrowly on family values issues as it did in the past two presidential races "we need a more moderate party that concentrates on economic issues " said thomas brady a computer programmer and army reservist who attended a recent &# a head campaign breakfast for mr giuliani in wilmington del "nothing got me more angry" than the partys focus on social issues in and he added iowa state sen jeff angelo describes himself as a pro life evangelical but signed on to the giuliani campaign after concluding that the former mayor is the only republican who could beat new york sen hillary rodham clinton if she were to win the democratic nomination "the republican party is beginning to realize it cant win without coalitions " he says in any event mr giulianis policies are " in step with the party " he adds such pleas for flexibility arent necessarily going to play with the partys social right as mr giulianis views and record become more widely known rick scarborough a politically active texas evangelist says the christian right is dismayed by government spending and the bush administrations handling of the iraq war but because of what he calls mr giulianis "radical leftist" social stands "we will not rally around him " he adds in solidly republican southwestern iowa joni ernst the montgomery county auditor and a republican party activist who is backing mr romney said mr giulianis refusal to set a timetable for withdrawal from iraq "might sway some but abortion is a lot to overcome " but ms lundby the republican lawmaker sees mr giuliani piquing the interest of women urbanites and republican leaning independents who she says lost interest in the party because of its focus on social issues those voters are most concerned with pocketbook issues she says and many "think the party lost its way "
