common sense valero saves cents at the pump and makes sense in a portfolio smartmoney its a summer weekend youve packed the car youre off to a barbecue and your eyes are on the gas gauge at least thats where mine have been with gasoline prices well above &# a gallon ive been thinking about cutting some trips i once would have embarked on without a second thought still my costly trips to the gas station have had a silver lining especially since ive made a point to patronize valero energy whose outlets have sprouted all along route in new jersey not only does valero tend to undercut its competitors by a few cents a gallon but i own valero stock watching the dollars and cents spin by on the pump i at least have the satisfaction of knowing that some of that will be returning to my pocket in the form of dividends or higher prices for valero shares but with oil prices topping the &# a barrel level and again pushing toward records is it time to think about cashing in to me the answer is a qualified yes just as i bought oil stocks when crude dropped below &# a barrel i would ordinarily be taking profits now that its above &# but ive become more cautious recently and reluctant to sell any of my energy positions outright thats because i think oil prices will remain high although they did dip below &# a barrel last fall providing a good buying opportunity i expected them to fall much further and stay low for longer im convinced that continued strong economic growth in emerging markets has led to a sustained rise in demand with higher prices the result higher interest rates may put a brake on this growth but not stop it so ive revised my oil trading range expectations to &# to &# a barrel from &# to &# id be an aggressive buyer at &# or below and a seller at &# or above in the meantime i wouldnt be surprised to see a modest pullback from the &# level over the next few months with this in mind i sold some out of the money covered call options on my positions in the aforementioned valero as well as suncor energy a call is an option to buy a security at a specific price my favorite strategy is selling "covered" calls this means i own the stock but sell the right to buy those shares at a fixed price at some point in the future if the stock is at or above the price on that date i either sell the stock at the strike price or buy back the option depending on my outlook for the stock if it is below the strike price i do nothing and simply keep the proceeds of the call option sale my hope is that the valero and suncor calls will expire worthless which means ill keep the cash and the stocks waiting to sell them until oil hits &# a barrel if the plan works ill have more than defrayed the higher cost of gas james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsjcommon
