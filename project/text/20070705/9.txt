battle of the soaps brazilian minister takes on tv giant upstart network sets off salary wars actor raids romance amid drug gangs rio de janeiro edir macedo the leader of a huge evangelical protestant church knows firsthand the impact of the melodramas produced by tv globo south americas dominant broadcaster after all globo once ran a scathing miniseries called "decadencia " about an unscrupulous minister who was a barely fictionalized version of mr macedo himself now in a strange plot twist mr macedo is having his revenge against globo and in the process turning what had been one of the worlds least competitive tv markets on its ear mr macedo has invested tens of millions of dollars in an effort to transform a tiny religious oriented network he owns rede record into a frank imitator of globo over the past three years record has bought and expanded an old studio on acres of land just a few miles from globos massive production complex offering salaries far above the going rate record has hired hundreds of actors technicians and journalists most of whom had cut their teeth at globo media critic fernao pessoa ramos says record has undertaken an "explicit cloning project " copying everything from globos newsroom set to its three point lighting for telenovelas or soap operas record even tried to poach globos longtime studio announcer when he turned down a big raise record hired away a stand in globo announcer who sounds just like him globos face off with its look alike competitor represents an entertainment earthquake in brazil where globo customarily pulls in more than half of prime time viewers and about three quarters of ad spending now records emergence is bringing down the curtain on a tropical version of the old hollywood studio system in which globo dominated all aspects of the entertainment scene and dictated its will to artists "for the first time actors have real negotiating power and real options " says lavinia vlasak a former globo supporting actress who moved to record for her first starring telenovela role mr macedo years old whose church has gained notoriety for its penchants for exorcism and aggressive fund raising is an unlikely benefactor for brazils dramatic community universal church finances have been the subject of numerous brazilian criminal investigations and mr macedo was jailed for several days in on charges of fraud and "charlatanism" the case was later dropped but thanks to pressure from record globo has had to hand out lucrative long term contracts to scores of actors to keep them from jumping ship salaries of top line actors have risen by about over the past few years according to the actors union in sao paulo some cameramen have doubled their salaries by moving to record their union says record has provided a fresh start for underexploited globo talents like tiago santiago for more than two decades mr santiago labored at globo as an actor consigned to bit parts and then as a soap scriptwriter who had to swallow his pride while more senior authors often got the credit for his work "in brazilian tv you took what globo gave you and kept quiet " says mr santiago in mr santiago took a chance and accepted a job as a lead author at record his record telenovela "prova de amor " or "proof of love " a romance that had elements of crime and suspense was a surprise hit his &# a month salary at record is times what he received at globo with the possibility for bonuses for beating globo in the ratings record says it has invested about &# million over the past three years on talent and infrastructure though some analysts say the figure is much higher record is also making big bids for special events paying a record &# million for rights to transmit the winter olympics and the summer games in sao paulo brazils largest market record has about doubled its share of prime time viewers to over the past three years and surged into second place from the third position it had been stuck in for years overall record still trails globo by a wide margin but certain record programs such as its morning magazine show now give globo a run for its money a former worker in a state lottery mr macedo founded his universal church of the kingdom of god in it has attracted several million brazilian followers and spread to more than countries the churchs riveting services including ceremonies to exorcise demons and heal the sick have proven especially popular among the working classes another attraction is the churchs preaching that prayer can help worshipers achieve earthly treasure especially if they donate regularly to the church until its recent secular turn record was best known for the broadcast of a sermon by a universal church preacher during which he kicked a statue of a saint revered by brazils roman catholics triggering a huge uproar a few weeks prior to the kicking episode globo had run "decadencia " the miniseries about a sleazy luxury loving minister whose appearance and speech drew comparisons to mr macedos in addition globo whose controlling marinho family has historically been close to brazils catholic establishment has persistently run news stories casting a harsh light on universal church fund raising especially controversial has been the universal churchs emphasis on collecting tithes from members globo once ran a videotape leaked by an estranged associate of mr macedo showing the church leader exhorting ministers to make collections "you cant be shy " mr macedo said "ask ask ask " in globos view mr macedos current investments at record are highly suspect "where is that money coming from " asks octavio florisbal president of tv globo who says records ad revenues alone couldnt possibly pay for its expansion he suggests that authorities look into whether record is getting money from the universal church which could violate the churchs tax exempt status records president alexandre raposo says suggestions that record is being bankrolled by the universal church are false and evidence of prejudice against evangelicals he says records growth is easy to explain advertising revenue has more than doubled to around &# million since and mr macedo who also sells inspirational books and cds has reinvested the profits mr raposo says the church pays record to run religious programming after a m but thats all the money it gives the network globo says mr macedos recruiters play dirty pool trying to hire away one telenovela leading lady midway through the seven month run of a soap nevertheless globo says it has preserved the cream of its talent base and that some of the defectors to record already want to come back marcilio moraes a record telenovela scriptwriter who had previously spent almost two decades at globo says hes happy to be working for mr macedos network mr moraes says that in his current hit record telenovela "vidas opostas" "opposite lives" he has enjoyed more creative freedom to deal with issues like crime and poverty than he ever had at globo mr moraes says theres no way globo advertisers would have wanted their brands associated with the raw realism of his soap a romeo and juliet drama set amid rios gang wars globo denies that it glosses over brazils social ills and notes that a critically praised miniseries on slum life ended its run on globo only a couple of years ago mr moraes says he hasnt faced religious censorship at mr macedos network and even scripted telenovela scenes in a convent and at a catholic wedding in an earlier record telenovela of course he says laughing "there werent any saints in the scenery "
