prosecution for profit when president bush issued an executive order in may barring federal agencies from hiring private lawyers on a contingency fee basis the press corps yawned but mr bush was getting out ahead of one of the bigger legal battles now raging across the country prosecutorial neutrality americas legal system is based on the idea that government officials act on behalf of the public interest not for personal profit thats why we dont pay policemen per arrest judges a percentage of damages they award or prosecutors a bounty for each conviction yet public officials are increasingly violating this ethic by outsourcing legal work to tort lawyers who profit from prosecuting public claims the practice developed in the s when state attorneys general promised trial lawyers a percentage a contingency of any settlement they could beat out of big tobacco and it has since spread like bird flu in rhode island and california prosecutors have tried to give plaintiff firms a cut of judgments against lead paint makers oklahoma wants to reward private attorneys for suing poultry companies mississippi ag jim hood has signed contingency deals in securities cases the practice has become a lucrative new tort business to the point that plaintiffs attorneys are now recommending lawsuits to state officials in some instances governments simply target an industry and then let the tort lawyers decide whom to sue and on what grounds the tort lawyers then turn around and send a portion of their profits back to the politicians in the form of campaign contributions the good news is that defendant companies are starting to fight back in court and are winning the superior court of california in april ruled that the county of santa clara could not pay contingency fees to private attorneys in this case tort lawyer giants thornton &amp naumes and motley rice who were suing lead paint manufacturers on behalf of the government the county had argued that since government retained "oversight" of the attorneys there was no problem judge jack komar pointed out the impossibility of determining how much control a government attorney must exercise to make a contingency fee deal legitimate he cited the california supreme courts clancy decision which noted that a contingency arrangement "is antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet " unfortunately californias high court is one of the few to have addressed such fee agreements some defendants have noted the supreme court decision in tumey v ohio which barred paying government officials a bounty for arrests and convictions during prohibition the rhode island supreme court last year seemed intrigued by this argument and returned a lawsuit over contingencies to a lower court for more consideration still prosecutors are busy dreaming up reasons why tumey doesnt apply and the contingency issue is probably destined for the supreme court in the meantime some states are moving to bar these contracts or make them more transparent government prosecutors claim they need outside lawyers because they lack the money and resources for big suits but surely if the tort bar is as interested in "public justice" as it professes itll work by the hour and if prosecutors feel underfunded they can always request more money from the state legislatures that control the purse strings budgetary oversight is in fact one check on prosecutorial excess in the berger case the supreme court noted the obligation of a prosecutor "is not that it shall win a case but that justice should be done " sometimes that means foregoing a suit or balancing litigation with other public policy goals such concepts arent priorities for trial lawyers whose main goal is to hit the financial jackpot the u s justice system is frayed enough without making trial lawyers the deputized vigilantes of public prosecutors see related letter "letters to the editor contingency fees help protect public interest" wsj july
