kkrs ipo may set firm on rugged path more self reliant deals aim to expand brand challenge the big banks the filing for an initial public offering of stock by private equity pioneer kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co portends a new confrontational path for the buyout business it lays out a strategy that will transform the firm from a private equity player that raised and invested money through a web of relationships using the cash like other private equity firms to take over change and resell companies to one that increasingly goes it alone this new strategy will put the firm in direct and intense competition with wall streets big investment banks kkr has been moving to a new model for at least a year rather than relying on wall street to source its deals founders henry kravis and george roberts have asked kkr partners to form relationships with executives across a range of industries and to source deals themselves for example recent purchases such as first data and alliance boots did not come from wall street bankers say kkr &amp co lp as the firm will be known will use the offering to transform itself into a broader investment company flashing the kkr "brand" along the way that means expanding funds for debt investments as well as for minority investments in existing public companies the filing also makes extensive mention of a nascent capital markets business which the firm said it will use to develop new methods for syndicating out placing securities with a large number of investors the billions of dollars of debt and equity used as part of its buyouts the strategy effectively makes kkr a rival as well as a customer of the big investment banks perhaps most significant the filing suggests that kkr will be trying to create in essence its own self contained financing ecosystem saying it hopes to "reduce our reliance on third party sources of capital " syndications have until now been handled almost exclusively by other private equity firms and a coterie of wall street banks which are paid handsomely for their services during the first half of for instance private equity paid an estimated &# billion to investment banks according to research firm dealogic up from the earlier year a mature capital markets unit will help kkr capture some of those fees for itself while "reducing the need to partner with large consortiums of private equity firms on large leveraged buyouts " as one top wall street banker put it "ultimately theyre going to be our competitor " and rather than relying on peers at other private equity firms kkr has been aggressively turning to its own investors and potential investors to supply the equity for its transactions in the past year many private equity firms began quietly recruiting wall street bankers to help them design financing structures for their deals mr kravis reached out to citigroup and hired craig farr from that banks equity capital markets group to help kkr place the equity in its deals without turning to wall street itself to be sure there are risks in the go it alone approach kkr has already run into challenges in trying to distribute the equity in its deals both because many investors have reached limits in how willing they are to have exposure to kkr deals and because in going beyond its traditional investors kkr has tried to charge fees kkr filed for its ipo on tuesday seeking &# billion the year old firm which has expanded its assets under management to &# billion from &# billion at the end of says it already has &# billion in "permanent" capital meaning it does not have to be returned to its core investor group of endowments pension funds and wealthy individuals already kkr is a massive global conglomerate with interests in companies valued at more than &# billion and employing some the filing also helps put a rough value on the holdings of the firms two principal owners messrs kravis and mr roberts each has a voting stake while no valuation or offering price was put on the deal one person familiar with the deal described the initial &# billion offering as "closer to than " of kkrs value using that yardstick kkr would be valued at roughly &# billion kkrs filing comes just weeks after the ipo of rival private equity firm blackstone group but unlike blackstone founders stephen schwarzman and peter petersen messrs kravis and roberts are not planning to sell any shares as part of the offering blackstones offering valued mr schwarzmans stake at more than &# billion and he took out &# million of that from the ipo proceeds in comparing the two firms blackstones dramatic rise becomes apparent founded in blackstone is nine years younger than kkr but it has &# billion in assets under management compared with &# billion for kkr and had net income of &# billion in roughly twice as much as kkr during kkr earned fee and investment income of &# billion compared with &# billion for blackstone the filings also reveal blackstone to have bested kkr in one very important category private equity investment returns over the life of various investment funds kkr said it made an annual return of after fees by comparison blackstones ipo showed a annual return kkr has been the most aggressive private equity deal maker so far this year at a time when other private equity executives have warned that prices and debt levels have risen too high and earning strong returns into the future would be difficult "i love our companies " mr kravis said recently "we are back to the s in terms of the availability of great names " investors though appear to be losing their enthusiasm for these deals both debt and equity investors have been pushing back against the terms offered in buyout deals this nascent rebellion has forced banks to reduce or delay bond offerings from several recent buyouts including aholds u s foodservice as well as servicemaster for these investors private equity firms have had it too easy for too long quickly "flipping" transactions in and out of the markets for huge profits investors are seeking to get a bigger piece of the private equity firms gains meanwhile the big banks are being stuck with equity they cant sell off increasing their risk and further raising tension between private equity firms and wall street in surprisingly frank language kkr warns investors that some of its most recent successes will not be so available in the future it notes that firm returns have been improved by "a substantial decrease in the average holding period of such investments and rapid and substantial increases in value following the dates on which those investments were made trends and rates of return that are not expected to continue " there is also the matter of congress which has in recent weeks been agitating to change the tax treatment applied to private equity firms kkr also warned that new tax provisions would materially affect the value of its offering
