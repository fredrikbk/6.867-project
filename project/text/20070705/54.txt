money meltdown interest rates are on the rise in the eurozone great britain and japan as well as in india and china but the federal reserve has again elected to keep its target rate on hold despite repeated assertions that inflation risk is still its predominant concern are central banks abroad recognizing a threat that their american counterpart has yet to acknowledge the fed seems to believe that inflation has something to do with "excessive" demand although it admits that inflation is already running at an unacceptable pace the majority of its policy officials cling to the belief or hope that the u s economy is slowing down alleviating the inflation threat both of these assumptions are inconsistent with historical evidence whats more the recent rise in the euro and sterling relative to the dollar has obscured the fact that the world economy has embarked on another classic "run" on paper currencies that is driving inflation up everywhere for several years now as was the case in the s all the worlds currencies have been depreciating relative to stable benchmarks such as gold since the end of these declines have ranged from in the case of the euro to nearly in the case of the dollar why then has the pace of consumer price inflation to date been so much less noteworthy than the pace of currency depreciation against gold the answer lies in the timing gold is a fast moving leading indicator whereas consumer price indices are slow moving indicators that lag far behind we all learned in the period between and that consumer prices do eventually catch up it is the size of the move in the gold price rather than in the consumer price index that is a true and timely indicator of the magnitude of the inflation problem in yale economist richard cooper described the process that now appears to be driving world inflation as "a general loss of confidence in money a psychological mood that can be transmitted across national boundaries that will lead individuals to try to convert their assets into physical form goods or housing or real estate " but why does this phenomenon break out at some times and not at others why is it sometimes local and sometimes global history provides the answer following world war ii rapidly rising prices began to be accepted as an inevitable even "normal" fact of life but in reality up to and including the th century significant inflation had been the exception rather than the rule and when it did occur it was usually local rather than global in the u s for example cumulative consumer price inflation was zero from to just prior to world war i in the united kingdom consumer prices were lower at the beginning of world war ii than they had been in in england the prices of consumables rose at an average annual rate of less than over the centuries long run between and against this relatively stable background inflation erupted when nations faced acute fiscal stress particularly in times of all out war a government that lost a war of survival typically saw the value of its paper currency evaporate to zero in the final stages of this process hyperinflation and astronomical interest rates accompanied economic chaos the defeated government either did not survive such as the confederacy in or had to be rescued from its currency crisis by the victors as in germany and austria in and germany and japan after even the winners of all out wars especially those that emerged seriously impoverished such as britain in resorted to currency devaluations and suffered high inflation as a result in all cases inflation was related to the inability or unwillingness of the governing authorities to maintain a stable currency in times of war related government spending and debt although we are not entirely at peace today u s military activity is at nothing like the all out scale from or so why are we having an inflation problem and why is it global in scope there are two culprits first since no government had made an attempt to fix the gold value of its currency and every political initiative that raises long term government spending leaves the financial markets free to price currencies at a lower gold value depreciation of currencies relative to gold has become unpredictable chronic and planet wide second the massive increase in the public sector share of the economy that occurred in world war ii and was reinvigorated in the late s has become permanent in place of war related debt public finance is now saddled with long range government spending commitments including burgeoning debt in the form of unfunded liabilities associated with national pensions and health insurance the popular notion that inflation is the way politicians reduce public debt without formally abrogating it is not far from the truth in a nutshell inflation is a manifestation of looming government insolvency this problem vastly overshadows the federal budget deficits with which washington is obsessed the military costs of the "war on terror" and the iraq conflict are mere addenda to a mountain of obligations which financial markets are warning that the federal government can only discharge by inflating away not that the other world economies are in any better fiscal shape than americas in fact throughout the th century the u s has been a sort of lender of last resort if we had not been on the scene in who else could have underwritten a new and viable currency for weimar germany though in recent times our allies in north america and europe have been less warlike than us they long ago adopted much more generous social "safety nets" and thereby undermined their long term solvency to an even greater degree than here inflation was negative following the civil war when the price of gold fell back to its pre war parity inflation was likewise low after world war i when the price of gold remained fixed in contrast inflation charged ahead after world war ii as the market price of gold was permitted to rise broadly speaking although a rise in the price of gold is a sufficient condition for consumer price inflation it is not entirely necessary the shortages that occur in a widespread war such as world war i may be sufficient to push up the price level despite price controls and adherence to the gold standard inflation is not intrinsically global it is obvious that some countries experience more inflation than others but currencies depreciating against gold across the board is a sign of world wide inflation and it has begun to set off alarm bells in many major economic capitals but in washington our own central bankers remain placidly confident that everything will turn out all right unsustainable peacetime spending is a much slower process than the unsustainable war spending far from sudden death currencies these days are facing death by a thousand cuts the unfortunate result is that the current crisis of confidence in paper money goes largely undiagnosed by the bulk of economists and policy makers mr ranson and ms russell are principals of h c wainwright &amp co economics
