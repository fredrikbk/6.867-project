mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions this week i was swamped with questions about apples hot new iphone so this is a special all iphone edition of mossbergs mailbox q can you physically remove the included at&amp t sim card from the iphone and replace it with another at&amp t card or one from another wireless carrier a yes and no the sim card which carries the iphones account information can be removed by inserting a paper clip into a tiny hole at the top of the phone however apple says that if you replace the included card with one from another carrier like t mobile in the u s or orange in europe the phone wont work according to apple some non iphone at&amp t cards may work but some may not its possible that hackers will figure out a way to override this lock on other carriers sim cards but as of now the iphone will work only with at&amp t even overseas at least until apple does deals with foreign partners you wont be able to use sim cards from other carriers the iphone will work overseas but you will have to roam with at&amp t and pay high charges for instance according to an at&amp t spokesman if you make a call in europe it would cost &# a minute it would cost cents a minute if you are on one of at&amp ts &# per month international plans q since the iphone battery is sealed in and cant be easily replaced by the user what happens when it dies will you have to buy a new iphone a no but you will have to send the phone to apple or drop it off at an apple store to have the battery replaced the battery is covered during the phones one year warranty period after that replacing the battery costs &# plus &# for shipping and takes three business days details are at apple com support iphone service battery some small companies may eventually offer to do this for less or in less time as they have for the ipod one twist because a phone is a necessity apple is offering loaner iphones for &# while your phones battery is being replaced or for the period of any other repair on the iphone you will have to switch the at&amp t sim card from your own phone to the loaner and then back again details are at apple com support iphone service faq in addition apple warns that all the data on your iphone will be wiped out during a battery replacement but notes that it can easily be restored by simply syncing again with the itunes software on your computer once you get it back with a fresh battery thats because whenever you sync your iphone with itunes it backs up the data on the phone you can also use this method to fill your loaner iphone with your own data q can i use the iphone via a bluetooth wireless connection in my car can i use bluetooth to transfer files or other information between the iphone and a computer a in my two week test of the iphone i succeeded in connecting it without much trouble to the built in audio system and microphone on a friends bmw almost instantly the over contacts i had on my test iphone were displayed on the cars dashboard screen and calls could be made and received through the iphone however this first iphone can use bluetooth to connect only with cars and with wireless phone headsets it cannot use bluetooth to transfer any data to or from a computer to play music through stereo wireless headsets or for any other purpose as with many other missing features apple has the ability to add these to the iphone through software updates delivered by synchronizing with your computer q if the iphones web browser is so good why cant it play video on web sites i visit a at launch the iphone version of the safari browser is missing some plug ins needed for playing common types of web videos the most important of these is the plug in for adobes flash technology apple says it plans to add that plug in through an early software update which i am guessing will occur within the next couple of months however a separate program included on the iphone can play a limited selection of videos from youtube and the phone can play videos you purchase from apples itunes store and certain videos you create yourself q you have been critical in the past of some smart phones that dont allow you to delete emails with a single click can the iphone do this a yes if you are reading an email and want to delete it you just tap on a trash can icon at the bottom of the screen and the message disappears into the trash can with an animation that resembles water being poured through a funnel however in the iphone email programs list view it takes two steps to delete an email you have to swipe across the message header or preview with your finger and then tap the red delete button that appears you can also press an "edit" button which allows you to delete emails in the list view but this still requires two taps per message unlike on a blackberry or treo the iphone doesnt allow you to delete whole groups of email en masse by date or even to select large groups and then delete them en masse this would be a good feature for apple to add down the line q can you buy an iphone and just use it to play music and videos like an ipod and to surf the web or get email over wi fi without signing up for an at&amp t service contract a no none of the iphones functions except calling will work unless the phone is covered by a two year at&amp t service contract and has been "activated" by at&amp t that will cost you &# a month at a minimum if you are thinking of buying an iphone you should plan on being an at&amp t customer and if at&amp t coverage is poor where you live work and travel frequently i advise you not to buy an iphone q you and many others have criticized at&amp ts edge data network which the iphone uses as slow you have noted that at&amp t has a much faster data network can the iphone be upgraded to use that faster network a no it cant this first edition of the iphone cant use any cellular network faster than edge which is much much slower than the fastest cellphone data networks available from at&amp t verizon or sprint it can however use very fast wi fi wireless networks when you are in range of them apple hasnt said anything about future iphone models but i fully expect a future model that can use these faster cellular networks which are usually called g networks so if this is very important to you id suggest waiting to see if such an iphone emerges but i dont expect this to happen anytime soon in the past few days at&amp t seems to have tweaked its edge network at least in some locations so it runs faster than it has in the past in my own speed tests around washington d c i have seen repeated speeds of around kilobits per second roughly better than the kbps i have seen with edge in the past however i have also recorded speeds as slow as kbps and even the new faster speeds are way below those of the faster american cellular data networks which can easily reach to kbps on a phone q how good is the iphones to do list or task function a awful in the sense that it doesnt exist the phone does have a calendar of course which syncs with the most popular calendar programs on windows and macintosh computers and it has a notepad which doesnt sync with any program on any computer though you can email notes to yourself and others but it has no to do list function at all
