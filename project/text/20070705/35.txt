genetic tests may cut chances of pregnancy embryo screening is seen ineffective in older women genetic screening designed to boost the odds of older women getting pregnant through in vitro fertilization may actually backfire according to a new dutch study published in this weeks new england journal of medicine the study of women found that those who underwent the genetic testing were less likely to have a child than those who didnt in vitro fertilization involves removing an egg from the ovary fertilizing it in a test tube and then implanting it in the uterus about seven in u s fertility clinics offer screening of embryos for abnormalities prior to implantation typically for a &# to &# fee in marketing materials fertility clinics tout the genetic testing as improving pregnancy and birth rates based on research suggesting embryos with abnormal numbers of chromosomes are less likely to lead to a successful pregnancy known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis the procedure calls for removing a single cell from a days old embryo to determine if there are any chromosomal abnormalities using this method only embryos with a normal chromosomal structure are implanted in the womb the procedure is most commonly recommended for older women who typically have a harder time getting pregnant through in vitro fertilization and are more likely to produce embryos with chromosomal abnormalities the dutch researchers split the women age to into two groups those that underwent the screening during in vitro fertilization and those who didnt the percentage of screened women reaching the th week of pregnancy was just significantly lower than the in the nonscreened group the birth rate among the screened women was also lower compared with among those whose embryos werent screened one of the studys authors university of amsterdam prof sjoerd repping said clinics should stop offering the procedure "there is no data showing this is effective which is striking considering it is used so widely " dr repping says one reason the procedure may not work as intended is that it involves piercing the protective shell around the embryo to remove a cell that is tested for abnormalities dr repping says the process of removing the single cell might be harmful to the embryo in addition the single cell that is removed may not be representative of all of the cells dr repping says in an accompanying editorial mcmaster university professor john collins said the genetic screening "appears to do no more than interfere with the natural screening and selection process " he said the screening shouldnt be targeted at older women other experts however said the study isnt the last word on the issue "the question is are these results truly generalizible to other clinics " says kathy hudson the director of the genetics &amp public policy center at johns hopkins university "the answer is we dont know " and more research is needed dr hudson says women considering the genetic screening should ask their fertility clinic for its results using the technique and then review those with an obstetrician
