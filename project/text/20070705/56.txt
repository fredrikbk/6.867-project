moving on blame it on mr rogers why young adults feel so entitled don chance a finance professor at louisiana state university says it dawned on him last spring the semester was ending and as usual students were making a pilgrimage to his office asking for the extra points needed to lift their grades to as "they felt so entitled " he recalls "and it just hit me we can blame mr rogers " fred rogers the late tv icon told several generations of children that they were "special" just for being whoever they were he meant well and he was a sterling role model in many ways but what often got lost in his self esteem building patter was the idea that being special comes from working hard and having high expectations for yourself now mr rogers like dr spock before him has been targeted for re evaluation and hes not the only one as educators and researchers struggle to define the new parameters of parenting circa some are revisiting the language of child ego boosting what are the downsides of telling kids theyre special is it a mistake to have children call us by our first names when we focus all conversations on our childrens lives are we denying them the insights found when adults talk about adult things some are calling for a recalibration of the mind sets and catch phrases that have taken hold in recent decades among the expressions now being challenged "youre special " on the yahoo answers web site a discussion thread about mr rogers begins with this posting "mr rogers spent years telling little creeps that he liked them just the way they were he should have been telling them there was a lot of room for improvement nice as he was and as good as his intentions may have been he did a disservice " signs of narcissism among college students have been rising for years according to a recent study led by a san diego state university psychologist obviously mr rogers alone cant be blamed for this but as prof chance sees it "hes representative of a culture of excessive doting " prof chance teaches many asian born students and says they accept whatever grade theyre given they see bs and cs as an indication that they must work harder and that their elders assessed them accurately they didnt grow up with mr rogers or anyone else telling them they were born special by contrast american students often view lower grades as a reason to "hit you up for an a because they came to class and feel they worked hard " says prof chance he wishes more parents would offer kids this perspective "the world owes you nothing you have to work and compete if you want to be special youll have to prove it " "theyre just children " when kids are rude self absorbed or disrespectful some parents allow or endure it by saying "well theyre just children " the phrase is a worthy one when its applied to a teachable moment such as telling kids not to stick their fingers in electrical sockets but as an excuse or as justification for unacceptable behavior "theyre just children" is just misguided "call me cindy " is it appropriate to place kids on the same level as adults with all of us calling each other by our first names on one hand the familiarity can mark a loving closeness between child and adult but on the other hand when a child calls an adult mr or ms it helps him recognize that status is earned by age and experience its also a reminder to respect your elders "tell me about your day " it is crucial to talk to kids about their lives and that dialogue can enrich the whole family however parents also need to discuss their own lives and experiences says alvin rosenfeld a manhattan based child psychiatrist who studies family interactions in america today life often begins with the anointing of "his majesty the fetus " he says from then on many parents focus their conversations on their kids todays parents "are the best educated generation ever " says dr rosenfeld "so why do our kids see us primarily discussing kids schedules and activities " he encourages parents to talk about their passions and interests about politics business world events "because everything is child centered today were depriving children of adults " he says "if they never see us as adults being adults how will they deal with important matters when it is their world " email jeffrey zaslow wsj com read past moving on columns at careerjournal com see related letters "letters to the editor in mr rogers neighborhood hard work made you feel special" wsj july
