japan in the balance with the elections of nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany two important countries are turning away from anti americanism but now one of americas most important asian allies japan may reject a leader who is steadfastly committed to expanding relations with washington as recently as late may prime minister shinzo abe seemed well positioned for parliamentary elections three weeks from now these seemed destined to be a referendum on his leadership and a convincing win by his liberal democratic party would have dispelled doubts about his ability to govern after a half decade of rule by the charismatic junichiro koizumi now the vote likely will pivot on scandal and mismanagement of the countrys enormous pension system this is a shame the election really should be about mr abes vision for a more activist international role for japan mr abes problems are in part self made this week his defense minister resigned after stating that the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were unavoidable earlier he had called the iraq war a mistake by the u s and mr abe himself set off a firestorm by suggesting that japan wasnt culpable for enslaving thousands of "comfort women" during world war ii then there is his cabinets approval rating languishing at thanks to shoddy management of the governments pension system and the specter of bureaucratic corruption following the suicide of agriculture minister toshikatsu masaoka to bolster his ratings mr abe needs to mollify the public and shift the debate by focusing on the big picture the necessity of further strengthening japans foreign and security policies the danger is that unless done carefully this emphasis might backfire and embolden those who see the prime minister as a dangerous nationalist mr abe came to office pledging to project japanese influence and build up its power he was committed to continuing mr koizumis close relationship with the u s and he soon added his own tactic of patriotically asserting japans national interests even as he moved to unfreeze relations with china and south korea a large part of those interests focused on holding kim jong ils north korea responsible for kidnapping more than a dozen japanese nationals in the s and s the stalinist regime used them to train spies and saboteurs mr abe also pushed forward with constitutional revision freeing japan from its year inability to act in collective self defense with its allies and removing the limitations of article of the postwar constitution he continued tokyos participation in ballistic missile defense development with the u s he also recently asked to purchase americas most advanced stealth fighter the f as a hedge against chinas growing military capabilities yet mr abes firm support for u s goals has not always translated into tangible gains the pentagon is balking at allowing tokyo to buy the f s ostensibly because of export restrictions on advanced military hardware though it may have more to do with washingtons desire not to antagonize beijing by giving the japanese a clear strategic edge moreover the bush administration has pushed ahead with its february nuclear deal with north korea despite japans refusal to participate until the abductee issue is settled the message from the u s is "trust us well take care of you in the end " but thats not good enough for a country feeling the pressure of a rising china and the confidence of several years economic recovery after a stagnant s lately japans policies have complemented washingtons goals of spreading democracy free markets and ensuring asian stability for example tokyo has proposed ambitious plans for integrating east asia into a common economic bloc and linking democracies in the region to create an "arc of freedom and prosperity " in addition tokyo continues to provide public goods in the asia pacific region from counterterrorism training to millions of yen in development aid for these reasons japan has become if anything a more important partner of the u s washington policy makers should hope that mr abe wins the election there are others waiting in the wings to take over the top spot but none of them seem as committed as mr abe to transforming japans role in asia and the world his fall would likely result in less visionary leadership possibly even a turn to leaders who seek greater accommodation with china or conversely to a more hawkish replacement either would damage japans attempts to lead the emerging east asian community greater u s support for mr abes policies will help him make the case that his goals are recognized abroad as contributing to peace and stability and are in japans best interests in the end japans citizens will decide what kind of leadership they want to pilot their country in the coming years despite scandal and missteps they might find that it is mr abe who offers the most compelling vision of their countrys role in the world mr auslin
