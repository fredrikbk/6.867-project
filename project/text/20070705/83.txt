style fashion journal around the world in eight outfits how two business travelers pack for overseas trips black armani for middle east there are those who pack light for a business trip and arrive with the wrong shoes others pack heavy and wind up feeling yoked to their bags then theres nancy novogrod one of the worlds very well wheeled travelers as editor in chief of travel + leisure magazine ms novogrod spends roughly a quarter of the year traveling for her job often to far flung places like egypt and china where she needs to convey the aplomb of a smart executive if you think youve got it tough with that four day conference in frankfurt imagine packing for a three week tour of asia like the one ms novogrod is taking this fall that includes daily meetings speeches and formal dinners that require a change of shoes dress and handbag ive seen her in action on more than one occasion and im here to say that she doesnt wrinkle not as far as i can tell to attain that level of perfection she packs a bag full of tricks suiting up for business travel can be tricky for any of us who want to make the right impression but women who have more stylistic latitude than men in the u s face a bigger risk of being off point overseas travel is particularly complex if it involves a vastly different culture another veteran traveler hotel industry attorney k c mcdaniel on any day may be testifying at a trial in london or negotiating on behalf of clients in dubai in the middle east she is sometimes the only woman in the room and one of the first women her clients adversaries have been confronted with on a professional basis "if you walk through the door and your outfit says secretary or file clerk you have an uphill job to do " she notes ms novogrod and ms mcdaniel say their packing process starts with buying the right clothes looking for comfort fabrics that can travel with minimal care and styles that will bridge cultures both women do serious research on the local mode of dress before they begin packing for a speech in cairo in april ms novogrod called the event planner to ask what people would be wearing "i buy a lot at prada because they use a lot of synthetics " says ms novogrod thinking of wrinkles "i love cotton shirts but i rarely wear them on airplanes i rarely travel with jeans because i need to look put together " another trick she employs a closet full of close fitting cashmere cardigans that add warmth and a put together edge ms novogrod says she takes care to choose clothes that work rather than those that make a statement "its possible with fashion to become so concerned with the surface that youre not approachable " she notes "im conscious of looking appropriate to my age to my profession " but she is careful not to play it too safe because there are situations where a distinctive colorful piece can work ms novogrod has been very happy with a recent purchase of a cotton pucci tunic it has turned out both to be packable and to look great from stages or a dais the actual packing process for ms novogrod can take place over several days she makes notes in advance when she settles down to pack with her schedule in hand she lays out outfits complete with shoes and handbags to be sure she has the right thing for each event and not a single extra item "otherwise you end up taking way too much " she says "what gets me most is coming back with clothing that ive never worn i hate that " ms novogrod checks one roll on suitcase for a shorter trip say up to a week for longer trips like the three weeks in asia she takes two roll ons one for clothes and another for shoes and bags for her lawyerly work in the middle east ms mcdaniel wears plain suits for day and "fairly substantial jewelry because its a community that does wear jewelry " she says "if youre a person of significance well chosen jewelry always helps " ms mcdaniel has three armani pant suits one black one black with tiny pinstripes and one with a silk black and white polka dot jacket that are her favorites for the middle east the light wool crepe billows and breathes black she notes is a safe color for women in the middle east in the united kingdom by contrast ms mcdaniel favors classic louis feraud designs and avoids wearing plaid or tweeds there because "it says horse and hounds to them " cardigans are ms mcdaniels secret weapon in the worlds poorly heated and air conditioned courtrooms moreover the cardigan imparts a trustworthy look "you dont want to look cold and overpowering as an expert witness " says ms mcdaniel who is six feet tall in heels she favors pants in conservative cultures where showing leg could be a problem "i dont wear skirts if im in a country where the skirt becomes a hem length issue " ms mcdaniel notes overall she advises "be inconspicuous " while on the road ms novogrod says she "curates" her clothing caring for it just as she does at home she travels with a small steamer to get rid of wrinkles at all costs she avoids hotel dry cleaning "i invest in my clothing and i dont want it to be ruined " getting the clothes right matters she says "i owe it to my employers im the representative of the brand "
