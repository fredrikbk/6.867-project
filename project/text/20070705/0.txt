a small firm takes on chinese pirates chicago maker of brababy travels to asia to hunt down companies selling knockoffs when robert engels year old son asked him recently what he was doing online all day mr engel explained that he was playing a new computer game brababy pirate brigade it isnt a real computer game but its all too real to mr engel the year old chicago entrepreneur is battling rampant piracy of his companys brababy a plastic cage that looks like a wiffle ball and prevents bras from getting tangled in the spin cycle what he is really up to on that computer four hours a day is tracking chinese companies selling knockoffs of brababy online at cut rate prices its not difficult to find the impostors mr engel says many of them brazenly use the name brababy sometimes with a slightly different styling from the rendering mr engel uses they often appropriate mr engels logo and his promotional photos including shots of his wife laura brababys creator cradling the product "you think the hard part is coming up with a great product but then you find out the hard work has just begun " mr engel says he compares his fight to a game of whac a mole shut down one company and another springs up multinational companies like walt disney co and nike inc have long lost business to chinese knockoffs pfizer inc employs full time counterfeit investigators to clamp down on phony viagra but mr engels crusade illustrates the enormous challenge a small business faces trying to protect its intellectual assets in china mr engel whose angel sales inc boasts a staff of just eight besides himself and his wife doesnt have investigators or crack legal teams to fight sophisticated pirates well versed in the cat and mouse game "if i dont do the policing who else is going to do it for me " he asks adding "i now see this as a cost of doing business " mr engel says he has seen his brababy priced as low as cents compared with its normal &# wholesale cost an australian company recently backed out of a deal with angel sales after discovering the cheaper knockoffs on the internet the company accused mr engel of selling the product above "fair market value " he says with the help of his lawyers mr engel has already sent cease and desist letters to chinese companies a few have stopped but the rest have plowed ahead replacing mr engels promotional photos with their own or simply ignoring him the uphill battle has even strained mr engels relationship with his wife who invented brababy two years ago and as vice president manages its marketing "the pressure doesnt stay here at work its going through my whole life " says mr engel a jazz trumpet player and jujitsu enthusiast laura engel adds "well be so mad at each other for a day or two and its not fun because we have to go home to dinner together " before the brababy came along the engels had created a small business by developing and selling household products such as key chain racks and gardening tools mainly through mail order catalogs and online sales they never had a big seller until brababy which became a hit selling up to items a week after television personalities rachael ray and tony danza promoted it on their morning talk shows brababy began airing on home shopping networks last spring mr engel says chinese companies immediately began advertising their knockoffs printing the familiar red "as seen on tv" logo on their boxes and ads to drum up sales earlier this year mr engel signed a deal licensing brababys retail distribution rights to onecare of alpharetta ga which plans to brand the product with procter &amp gamble co s tide logo and sell it at big box retailers including wal mart stores inc target corp and bed bath &amp beyond inc mr engel wants to nip the copycats in the bud and make sure his partners dont get spooked by a flood of cheap knockoffs china is hardly the only intellectual property battleground in the world as threats to brababy from south korea and turkey attest but it is among the worlds riskier markets so mr engel has taken the fight to the pirates in april he arrived in guangzhou for the canton fair chinas largest export trade show carrying a briefcase stuffed full of trademarks and design patents his mission to scour the fairs odd booths for the chinese companies selling knockoffs of his product to importers at cut rate it didnt take mr engel long to find china base ningbo foreign trade co selling tens of thousands of the item for as little as cents apiece after posing as a potential buyer and asking a few questions about the product mr engel walked off with a brochure and stormed into the fairs intellectual property complaints office where he learned he lacked the proper documentation to prove his identity a few days later in beijing he consulted with the lawyer who had helped him register brababy in china and got no more satisfaction the lawyer told him his application was backlogged a typical problem in china where trademarks often take up to three years to be registered when mr engel returned to guangzhou and nearby hong kong for a second round of sleuthing he found another eight trading companies exhibiting the brababy for sale into overseas markets all told he logged hours of flight time on his recent scouting trip on his next foray into china mr engel says hell have all of his paperwork ready including original copies of forms linking him with his company in the tangled world of intellectual property claims mr engel himself isnt immune to challenges an austin texas company called braball holds an earlier u s patent on a product similar to the brababy though braball part owner jack lander a past president of the united inventors association says there are no immediate plans to challenge mr engels product in court "were competing on quality " he says onecare the company that bought the retail distribution rights for brababy from the engels says it doesnt comment on intellectual property rights but is launching the brababy in the fall at major u s retailers thus far mr engel says he has spent about &# registering the brababy for patenting copyright and trademark in the u s the european community australia new zealand taiwan and hong kong as well as in china but copycats are legion and capable of dissolving quickly and reforming under another name "its like chasing ghosts " mr engel says occasionally the ghosts materialize while scouting one of the fairs on his recent trip mr engel came across a familiar name bingo hu owner of ningbo bingo international co and two other companies based in ningbo a city on the east china sea "ive been sending you love letters and you havent been replying " mr engel says he told mr hu at his booth where something called the brasaver was displayed after mr engel confronted him mr hu says he immediately contacted his suppliers and told them "not to give me any more trouble " he says he has since ceased shipping the brasaver "dont you care at all about what youre doing to my item " mr engel says he asked mr hu at his booth "he didnt seem the least bit scared "
