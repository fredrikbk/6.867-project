marketing athletes may now demand its own playbook questions for bill sanders title vice president of marketing company bda sports sports agents once existed simply to squeeze the most money from their clients teams but now representation means having a multiyear marketing plan before the brightest young stars are even drafted fresh off his selection as the first pick in the national basketball associations draft last week foot tall former ohio state center greg oden heads to the portland trail blazers with a small army of image makers behind him leading that army is bill sanders vice president of marketing for mr odens agency bda sports on the strength of mr odens success at ohio state where he took the buckeyes to the ncaa tournament finals this spring bda arranged a slew of endorsement deals for the year old with nike spalding topps videogame company k sports and watch maker raymond weil thats just the beginning there could be sports drink and fast food ads even movies to come mr sanders who does similar work for nba all stars yao ming steve nash and carmelo anthony discusses how quickly to push a young star on the public and what role new media plays in that strategy wsj shoes have always been a tougher sell for big men like greg how tough will it be to market greg and why mr sanders i think the statement that big men arent marketable is a fallacy i understand a little bit of the logic with shoes the average consumer isnt feet tall and a shoe thats built for a footer doesnt make sense but even when youre selling shoes there are two goals one is to sell specific shoes and the other is to sell the brand is lance armstrong a nike guy because of the bicycle equipment that he moves or because of what he does for their brand i think its perhaps both as far as broader marketing goes what makes a person marketable doesnt have to do with size or position or skin color shaquille oneal and yao ming are as marketable as anybody in the league if theres a dozen truly marketable players in the nba two of them are centers wsj do you want to ramp it up slowly or are you happy with it going full speed as quickly as possible mr sanders we dont want to rush anything we had meetings on madison avenue the past two or three days i didnt ask one person for a deal thats not what we were there for we said tell greg how to be an effective spokesperson tell him how to build his brand tell greg how you make your decisions its a learning process he ended up playing ping pong with the ceo of ad agency bbdo it wasnt about hey we want to pitch you on your pepsi account it was about heres greg oden can you teach him something down the road when the time is right please keep us in mind wsj how much of this marketing involves training versus natural charisma how much can be coached mr sanders its definitely both it has to be there i dont think you can fake star quality if its there someone has star quality you can tell pretty quickly but then you help them get comfortable with the right way to present it greg has worked with a media coach during one of the media training sessions recently we were getting ready to go on the donny deutsch show and we were role playing and asking questions that we thought donny deutsch might ask we asked greg what makes you marketable he sits for a minute and he flashes a big grin and he says because i can do this and he starts doing this crazy robot dance around the room i know youre entertaining us because you like to make people laugh but that is what makes you marketable hes a guy who has this tremendous sense of humor a lot of people dont really know that as soon as you get to know him it starts to come out were trying to make him comfortable with that wsj greg signed with nike a company with strong ties to china lebron james another nike spokesman has taken some heat for not signing a teammates petition criticizing chinas inaction regarding the darfur genocide how do you advise greg if a similar petition comes his way mr sanders one of our other players i dont want to mention who asked for some advice on that and we had a very long talk about how complex the issue is because of our experience with yao ming we know a lot more about china than perhaps some other people do we said look this is a very complex issue first of all chinas made tremendous strides in human rights since tiananmen square they want to compete on the world stage our opinion is they clearly want to address a lot of these issues because saving face is very critical in china and they dont want to be embarrassed because of any of their foreign policies or any of their human rights policies we believe in the progress that theyre making they cant stop their growth because theres blood on the hands of the sudanese government thats a very very tricky issue instead theyre in a great position to put pressure on sudan to do the right thing what i said to the player that asked for my advice was lets find a way for you to put pressure in appropriate places without causing embarrassment embarrassment i dont think works in china thats not the effective way to get change so would i say not to sign it i would say educate yourself on the issues dig really deep and go with your heart if greg dug deep into it and listened to input from people who knew what they were talking about and greg said he still needs to sign this we would say then you have to sign it
