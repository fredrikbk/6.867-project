how safe are imported goods as concern grows over tainted components from china regulators industry groups press for tougher screening in the wake of recalls involving products imported from china many people are left worrying about the safety of everyday items like toothpaste and pet food and what if anything they can do about it u s government officials say most imports from food to toys meet u s standards for health and safety but recent problems such as lead in childrens train sets antimicrobial agents in seafood and antifreeze ingredients in toothpaste underscore the difficulty of monitoring all imports and ingredients last week the food and drug administration detained imports of farm raised catfish shrimp eel and other fish from china because they contained antimicrobial contaminants and the agency also said it found diethylene glycol an antifreeze ingredient in toothpaste from china and earlier this year the agency said it traced numerous pet deaths in the u s to contaminated wheat flour produced in chinas jiangsu province while theres a push for more stringent standards the efforts are still limited the fda in may began to develop a food safety plan that will among other measures put a greater focus on food imports and expand screening for chemicals in february it launched a pilot program to better help consumers identify recalled food by posting pictures on its site of the foods label nsf international a not for profit organization that certifies products such as drinking water and dietary supplements has been developing a program to certify the safety of raw materials from international suppliers whose food is imported to the u s for the most part u s officials and the food industry say consumers have little to worry about the food safety and inspection service part of the department of agriculture says countries wishing to export meat poultry or egg products to the u s must go through an application process to ensure the countrys inspection standards are equivalent to those in the u s currently china doesnt export any beef chicken pork or egg products to the u s according to the inspection service despite detaining some seafood imports from the country the fda says that the amount of contaminants found in the fish is minimal and doesnt pose an immediate risk to public health still many consumers want to know more about where their food is made jeanne reilly a retired photographer from sykesville md has started checking the country of origin label on goods like rice and pasta and avoids buying goods from china she has also been staying away from processed foods with multiple ingredients "im really concerned about the safety factor " she says fish and shellfish are required to have a country of origin labeling as part of a usda marketing program imported packaged foods as well must list the country of origin on the label as must all nonfood goods with limited exceptions the consumer product safety commission says that more than of recalls so far in have been chinese made products compared with about from previous years yet even if a consumer can learn where a product was made that knowledge is no guarantee of a products safety "what helps ensure safety of product is not where it is from but the processes and programs that food companies have in place " says brian kennedy spokesman for the grocery manufacturers association a trade group while food labels must say where the product was made and list the ingredients theres no requirement to print where the ingredients come from so while a product might be made in the u s an additive might come from china there chinese and u s officials say it isnt uncommon for suppliers to swap a food grade product with an industrial grade one for example sodium bicarbonate baking soda can also be used for industrial purposes as a pesticide and as a detergent for example there it is held to a lower standard because nobody is supposed to be eating it when used industrially it may contain impurities including unsafe colorings and heavy metals which can be harmful when ingested chen yumin general manager of linan chengxin chemical co a company that makes sodium bicarbonate in zhejiang province says it is "normal to see manufacturers use ingredients for industrial use to make food " since "all companies are pursuing the largest profit " xanthan gum too is susceptible to substitution the material can be used to lubricate drills or as a food additive in salad dressing to improve texture the problem extends beyond substitutions that threaten the food chain greg brown who retired in as president and chief executive of heads &amp threads international llc an importer and distributor of bolts screws and other fasteners that supplies companies including home depot inc caterpillar inc and the big car makers says it wasnt uncommon for manufacturers from mainland china and taiwan to send him products that didnt meet specifications sometimes the screws and bolts werent hard enough he says "when we found issues they always took care of them they were always apologetic " he says "but whether they are just testing us i dont know " some say chinese suppliers have improved their quality jimmy w hsu president of northeast chemicals inc in milltown n j which imports or so food additives and chemicals such as citric acid and vitamins from china and elsewhere is among those who see improvements years ago he says chinese suppliers might try to sell him citric acid for instance that didnt pass muster in the u s mr hsu says that these days however the quality of chinas citric acid has improved xia wenjun with the news office of chinas general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine declined to answer questions over the phone and her office didnt reply to a written request for comment it isnt just chinese companies that substitute ingredients a recent fda report that a u s company had added melamine an industrial chemical to animal feed is a reminder it can happen anywhere fda inspectors at u s border checkpoints rely on manufacturers to honestly identify their products because the fda inspects only a fraction of the shipments that enter the u s the food industry says most companies do due diligence on their suppliers and often bring in third party certifiers to make sure their ingredients are safe consumers can take several steps to determine the safety of nonfood products says scott wolfson deputy director of the office of information and public affairs for the consumer product safety commission the commission has been focusing on several categories of goods that are overwhelmingly produced in china such as toys cigarette lighters and electronic goods like extension cords and christmas lights the wiring in some electrical cords has been found to be too thin and can pose a fire risk he says so consumers should check electronics for a certification marks from a third party testing body such as ul from underwriters laboratories inc csa from the canadian standards association or etl from etl testing laboratories lead in toys and toy jewelry is trickier for consumers to determine last month the commission announced a recall of about million wooden trains made in china with paint containing lead which is toxic if ingested by young children and the commission has issued more than recalls involving more than million childrens jewelry products since at home lead testing kits may not always be accurate consumers should check www cpsc gov for recall information carter keithley president of the toy industry association in new york called the lead paint that turned up on toy trains "an aberration " he said toy makers follow strict industry standards that include testing by third party laboratories and that the industry group is reviewing the incident zhou yang sue feng and kersten zhang in beijing and ellen zhu in shanghai contributed to this article making safe choices some of the steps for gauging product safety with electronics look for a mark of third party safety verification such as ul csa or elt be wary of cheap childrens jewelry found in vending machines or discount stores such products have been found to contain lead report problems with food products at www fda gov opacom backgrounders complain html consumers can
