politics &amp economics european judges legacy reining in the regulators vesterdorf retirement means business loses an ally on eu court brussels corporate titans have learned to fear the european unions tough antitrust regulators in recent years now business interests are about to lose a key ally in their battles with brussels a feisty danish judge named bo vesterdorf mr vesterdorf has shaken up the way the eus court of first instance operates since he became president of the blocs main antitrust court in pushing his fellow judges to question regulators decisions more aggressively the result a string of reversals of european commission rulings blocking corporate mergers the often business friendly court precedents judge vesterdorf helped set will outlast his departure but business will lose an outspoken and influential critic of europes sometimes heavy regulatory hand "it was quite clear from the very beginning that the commission had to shape up and do a better job " judge vesterdorf said in an interview ahead of his retirement on sept referring to the eus brussels based executive arm those decisions have set precedents that should ensure the tough minded judicial review mr vesterdorf introduced will continue after he leaves the court "the commission has taken heed of the setbacks it suffered in rulings in recent years and taken steps" to comply said commission spokesman jonathan todd with eu decisions increasingly having a global reach there is a lot at stake over the past decade the european commission has blocked multibillion dollar mergers between major u s multinationals that do business here levied billions of dollars in fines and attacked software titan microsoft corp s business practices in arenas where u s regulators declined to intercede businesses have come to see the eus court of first instance as their last line of defense in europe by september the luxembourg based court will release one more big precedent setting verdict in microsofts appeal of a commission ruling finding market abuse that has so far cost the redmond wash company &# billion in fines the next president will determine how tough the court will be in for example challenging the increasingly large fines for price fixing abuses that the commission imposes according to michel struys a brussels based antitrust lawyer at allen &amp overy llp the courts judges will elect the next president when year old judge vesterdorf steps down "judge vesterdorf has done a lot to establish the authority of the court and its positions have been extremely good" for business mr struys said the court probably wont want to give up what it has got in terms of legal precedents that benefit business and rein in regulators he said "but we can only hope things will go in the right direction " he added eu courts have come a long way since when the european court of justice was established to settle disputes among members of the european coal and steel community precursor to the eu by though the eu had member countries and a growing list of laws to enforce the court of first instance was created to share the workload tasked with helping to enforce the rules of the eus common market judge vesterdorf was one of the new courts founding judges of which there are now one from every current member of the bloc under his nine year presidency judges began lobbing sharp questions at lawyers during hearings more in line with u s and british practice than the french procedures followed by the court of first instance in the court delivered three decisions that landed like bombs at the eus antitrust directorate in brussels the cases known as airtours schneider legrand and tetra laval reversed three commission decisions to block mergers of european companies in the travel electrical equipment and packaging industries the shock caused mario monti then the eus top antitrust regulator to revamp merger review procedures to require more rigorous economic analysis there was more embarrassment to come in mr monti had kicked up a major trans atlantic controversy by blocking general electric co chief executive jack welchs proposed tie up with honeywell international inc which u s regulators had already approved the companies appealed the eu ruling to the court of first instance in december judge vesterdorfs court rejected mr montis main rationale in the case namely that a merged ge honeywell would use its broad reach to close down competition in the avionics industry the court let the merger ban stand however citing evidence that a tie up would reduce competition in the smaller market in engines for corporate and regional jets the two companies never did merge judge vesterdorf also has taken strong action against judges perceived to be antibusiness in he removed the french judge overseeing microsofts appeal hubert legal after he derided the courts clerks as "ayatollahs of free enterprise" in a french legal journal judge vesterdorf took personal control of the microsoft case he declined to comment on the episode in mr monti was succeeded by neelie kroes of the netherlands as the eus top antitrust cop she has rejected few mergers preferring to focus on busting cartels where the court has been supportive ms kroes however has continued to pursue vigorously the microsoft case microsoft is the most complex and hard fought case involving monopoly power to ever come before the eu judges a ruling by the blocs regulators found the u s software company illegally uses its near monopoly in computer operating systems to stymie competitors the commission is threatening more penalties in a dispute over the level of royalties microsoft wants to charge competitors to license programming information designed to make the rivals products work well with microsofts windows whatever the court decides in the case will help set precedents for eu policy makers now struggling to define when a companys market dominance hurts consumers many observers are betting on a split decision upholding the commissions ruling on programming information but reversing an edict requiring microsoft to remove its media playing software from its windows platform which regulators say stunts competition and innovation judge vesterdorf sounded skeptical of that argument during microsofts april court hearing noting "every car comes with a cigarette lighter and radio "
