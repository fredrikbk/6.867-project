whats black and white and has the great lakes seeing red invaders like zebra mussels prompt michigan to require clean ballast shippers sue saugatuck mich state sen patty birkholz was walking along the sugar sand beach here on lake michigan recently when she picked up a handful of dime size black and white striped shells clinging together at the edge of the water "the first time i saw one of these i thought oh isnt that cute " sen birkholz said "ha we had no idea what we were in for " the shell turned out to be a zebra mussel a species indigenous to the caspian sea that scientists believe was dumped into the great lakes with the ballast water used to help stabilize trans atlantic ships since its discovery the mussel has cost about &# billion in damages to power companies boaters and the fishing and tourism industries sen birkholzs first sight of the tiny bivalve years ago began her long and frustrating crusade to keep any more invasive species out of the lakes that battle is coming to a head now in the federal courthouse in detroit there a coalition of nine canadian and u s shipping companies and trade associations sued to nullify a new michigan law championed by sen birkholz that requires shippers to clear their ballast water of any living organisms before dumping it into the states waters the systems needed for this cost about &# per vessel according to the state the shippers say theyre not against regulating ballast but that this particular statute is ineffective and unconstitutional "this is a national problem its an international problem and federal law ought to be paramount " said norman ankers attorney for the plaintiffs the lawsuit is the fulcrum of a broader battle over the purity of the great lakes involving business groups conservationists eight states and two canadian provinces on one side are those who say zebra mussels and scores of other invasive species are damaging the great lakes at a cost of more than &# million a year on the other are businesses that say regulating ballast in this way threatens the free use of shipping lanes and could cripple an already struggling regional economy in the early s the federal government required all vessels to empty and rinse their ballast tanks on the high seas before entering the great lakes this removes many but not all of the organisms from ballast water some that have remained and been pumped out into great lakes have taken root and thrived changing the ecosystem by out competing native species the most dramatic example of this is the zebra mussel which was first discovered in the lakes in each female produces a million eggs a year the filter feeding mollusks now cover hundreds of square miles of the lake beds and siphon enormous quantities of organic material at the bottom of the food chain this disruption results in clearer water which in turn is allowing invasive plants to grow on the lake bottoms where the sunlight was formerly unable to reach it also damages delicate food webs and upsets breeding sites reducing the number of game fish in the lakes "it used to take you longer to gut perch than it did to catch them " said randy mileskiewicz a charter boat captain in saugatuck who has been fishing in lake michigan for years "now if you go out and catch six or eight youre having yourself a good day " scientists estimate that about one third of the foreign invaders in the lakes have been introduced through ballast water a new species is discovered on average every seven months some of these invaders have piggy backed onto the hulls and propellers of recreational boats and spread as far west as lake mead in the nevada desert threatening to affect western waterways for more than a decade the great lakes regions congressional delegation has pushed for invasive species protection but had only limited success coordinating with international maritime organizations is complex and laborious powerful lobbyists for the shipping industry have opposed regulation and the issue has been poorly understood in washington said rep vernon ehlers r mich a few months after mr ehlers a nuclear physicist won his seat in he was arguing for money in a science committee for zebra mussel research in an effort to figure out how to stop their spread one congressman declared he was adamantly opposed to any such bill "he said i will not vote to appropriate money to study the muscles of zebras " mr ehlers said "a little light went off in my head that this was going to take some education i just assumed that everyone in the country knew how valuable the great lakes were " while legislation stalled in washington sen birkholz was fielding a litany of complaints about the effects of invasive species constituents who lived on small inland lakes were paying thousands of dollars a year out of pocket to treat eurasian watermilfoil an invasive weed originally spread through ballast water that grows so thick it hinders boating and swimming the tourism industry also was hurt by declining fish stocks and beaches covered with an invasive algae all the while the zebra mussel problem grew worse at one point sen birkholz floated the idea of putting a line item on residential electric bills called the "zebra mussel tax" to make people aware how much they were paying for power and water companies to hire divers several times a year to scrape away mussels clogging water intake pipes in the great lakes states lost nine seats in congress and sen birkholz realized legislation was not going to move through washington anytime soon in she introduced her state bill the law says that all ships that enter michigan waters must register with the state if they intend to dump ballast water they must treat it with one of four systems including removing oxygen from the water and using a chemical treament akin to bleaching that would help kill any living organisms the law affects only michigan water but was written with the intent of galvanizing legislatures in other contiguous states and canadian provinces to pass similar measures "this just reached a political tipping point " sen birkholz said "every year it was a new species more bad news and nothing out of washington " the law went into effect on jan as of this week ships have registered with the state at a cost of &# per ship according to the michigan department of environmental quality none dumped ballast so they did not need the equipment the fine for dumping untreated ballast is up to &# similar legislation has been proposed in new york wisconsin and minnesota in march the shipping consortium filed its suit to overturn the law saying that michigan has overstepped its jurisdiction and that only congress can regulate commerce with foreign nations georges robichon a senior vice president at montreal based fednav ltd a plaintiff in the suit and the largest owner and operator of ocean going vessels trading on the great lakes said the treatment technology now available is ineffective it would be better to wait until the technology is perfected sen birkholz says further delays are no longer acceptable the case took on additional importance this spring with the discovery of the viral hemorrhagic septicemia or vhs a deadly fish killing virus which has the potential to decimate the commercial and sport fishing industries in may a consortium of more than environmental groups called for the closing the st lawrence seaway which connects the great lakes with the atlantic to all ocean going ships until safeguards against additional invasive species are in place john jamian president of the seaway great lakes trade association one of the groups that brought the suit said closing the seaway would have a devastating impact on the already weak regional economy last month a consortium of conservation organizations including the national wildlife federation filed a notice that it would sue in federal court to bar ships from discharging ballast water in other lakes unless they install sterilization equipment "we cant afford to let the next zebra mussel in here while congress dithers " said andrew buchsbaum director of the federations great lakes office "enough is enough "
