debt bomb inside the subprime mortgage debacle the middlemen mortgage mess shines light on brokers role job hopping mr shaikh left trail of lawsuits failed license exams third in a series in world savings bank honored secure financial inc with a "top broker award " it was a tribute to the sales prowess of zak khan who arranged more than a hundred mortgages out of the small real estate firms union city calif office but mr khan a onetime professional cricket player wasnt all he seemed for starters his real name is altaf a shaikh contrary to california law he never held a license to broker mortgage loans still he managed to find jobs at a variety of mortgage firms since leaving a trail of unhappy borrowers and a lengthening list of criminal charges and lawsuits filed against him as defaults pummel the home loan industry mr shaikh represents an extreme case of one of the big vulnerabilities in the business mortgage brokers in recent years these middlemen have assumed a crucial role in handling surging volumes of business for lenders today mortgage brokers are involved in about of home loans up from a decade ago according to wholesale access a research firm in columbia md mortgage brokers originate about half of loans made to borrowers with good credit their presence is even greater in other segments of the mortgage market where defaults are rising brokers originate about three quarters of subprime mortgages made to borrowers with scuffed credit according to wholesale access they also originate of so called alt a mortgages a gray area that falls between prime and subprime world savings which gave the award to mr shaikhs employer made prime and alt a loans mortgage brokers didnt set the standards for the many aggressive loans that are now going sour but they provided the low cost sales force that made it possible for lenders to quickly ramp up production without hiring employees as business surged some brokers put borrowers into loans they didnt understand couldnt afford or were otherwise ill suited for one reason defaults have skyrocketed in the worst cases brokers have been known to falsify information and resort to other fraudulent means to get mortgage loans approved critics say regulators and lenders havent done nearly enough to insure the quality and integrity of this independent sales force "the mortgage brokers are the wild wild west of mortgage finance " sen charles schumer a new york democrat says in an interview "we need to bring a sheriff to town " mortgage brokers say it isnt fair to single them out joseph falk legislative chairman of the national association of mortgage brokers says regulators lenders and their wall street financiers all contributed to the subprime mess borrowers also can be cheated by loan officers at banks he notes adding "theres plenty of blame to go around " the ranks of mortgage brokers have surged in part because they offer lenders such as banks or thrifts a way to reach more borrowers without the heavy expense of operating large numbers of branches brokers find customers advise them on which types of loans are available and collect fees from lenders for handling the initial processing unlike bank employees brokers dont get medical benefits or need to be laid off when business is slow brokers are particularly active in low income neighborhoods where there are few bank branches and where many residents may assume that a big institution wouldnt want to deal with them when brokers cross the line into blatantly unethical or even criminal behavior theres often little to stop them surveys by the conference of state bank supervisors show that states dont require people to pass a test before obtaining a mortgage broker license and nine states dont require criminal background checks on license applicants brokers who run afoul of authorities in one state often can set up shop in another mr shaikh years old was able to skip from one employer to another for years with little scrutiny until california prosecutors finally caught up with him in may mr shaikh pleaded no contest to charges of grand theft in a plea agreement reached with nine california counties prosecutors alleged that he lied to borrowers about the terms of their loans forged documents and had checks written to companies he controlled without the borrowers knowledge a court hearing set for august will determine the amount of restitution mr shaikh must pay and whether he will be required to serve a one year jail term as the prosecutors have requested "the tragedy of this thing is that many of these people had better credit than the product that was offered to them " says william denny a deputy district attorney in alameda county calif who coordinated the multicounty settlement of the criminal case a spokesman for wachovia corp which bought world savings last year says the company "acted appropriately at all times in this situation " the spokesman adds that mr shaikh "was not an employee or an agent" of the company which wasnt a defendant in the criminal proceeding "we feel that world savings is a victim of fraud in this matter as well " the spokesman says jeff widman the lawyer representing mr shaikh in a lawsuit brought by borrowers says his client has "generally denied the allegations " most of the borrowers "consented happily to the terms of these loans and their fees " he adds in an interview earlier this year mr shaikh a stocky genial man with gray hair declined to discuss his legal problems he said he immigrated to the u s from pakistan in he settled in fremont home to some of his wifes relatives at first he worked at a taco bell restaurant and sold leather jackets imported from pakistan at a flea market court records show that he and his wife

friend who worked at ameriquest mortgage co persuaded mr shaikh to join the company then a small but fast growing subprime mortgage lender he was getting in on the early stages of a gold rush spurred by the housing boom of the first half of this decade the number of mortgage brokerage firms nationwide has soared to more than from in according to wholesale access at the height of the boom in and

year because a refinancing wasnt completed by a promised deadline mr shaikh failed to tell the holder of a second mortgage who was foreclosing on the loan to postpone the foreclosure sale according to the lawsuit filed in alameda county superior court the case was settled in according to joseph kafka the borrowers attorney mr shaikh left ameriquest in may for the san jose branch of atlantic financial mortgage inc a local firm later that year ameriquest sued him in santa clara county superior court for allegedly trying to steal ameriquest customers and employees in a superior court judge ruled in favor of ameriquest "mr shaikhs employment was terminated and were not able to comment on the reasons behind it " says an ameriquest spokesman at atlantic mr shaikhs customers included nathaniel winn and arnetta petty winn an elderly couple in oakland in a telephone call in may mr shaikh told the winns his company specialized in making low interest home loans to senior citizens on fixed incomes according to a lawsuit the couple filed in in alameda county superior court at a meeting at their home days later mr shaikh said he could refinance the winns into a new mortgage with a "senior discount" that would lower their monthly payments and allow them to pay off &# in debts he also offered to hire nathaniel to do some landscaping ms winn says in an interview but the couples monthly payments rose with the new mortgage and their loan balance climbed by about &# to &# the winns received just &# in cash from the refinancing according to loan documents while atlantic got more than &# the couple also paid a &# prepayment penalty in february a superior court judge issued a default judgment and ordered atlantic and mr shaikh to pay the couple &# mrs winn says she is still hoping to collect edwin mendaros atlantics owner didnt respond to repeated calls requesting comment mr shaikh was next hired as an assistant to a loan officer at home advantage corp a fremont mortgage broker located in a stucco building adjacent to a shopping center within six months the company received a call from a wholesale lender complaining about a "discrepancy" in a mortgage application mr shaikh had worked on says the firms president rana ahmed "we actually had to fire him " mr ahmed says mr ahmed says he doesnt always check references because in the mortgage business "references are not reliable " and he says he never heard from prospective employers seeking to check mr shaikhs references in january mr shaikh signed on with hampton financial a local san jose real estate and mortgage firm in nearby union city he opened an office called as west coast marketing scouting for potential borrowers and helping them fill out mortgage applications that were then processed by hampton in december mr shaikh arranged for mohammad and karima ebrahimi to get a &# mortgage from world savings to buy a home in fremont the good faith estimate a calculation of the fees borrowers can expect to pay at closing that is required by regulators provided that the ebrahimis would pay the broker &# but when the loan closed it included additional commissions of &# according to a lawsuit by the couple and two other borrowers that was before santa clara county superior court patricia deluca hamptons owner terminated her relationship with mr shaikh in early because of complaints and questions from borrowers according to her attorney john crowley ms deluca settled the lawsuit brought by the ebrahimis and the other borrowers for &# and filed a cross complaint alleging that mr shaikh and others conspired to engage in "wrongful and fraudulent conduct " according to court records in testimony related to her cross compliant ms deluca said world savings briefly cut its ties to her because of problems with loans originated by mr shaikh the ebrahimi lawsuit names mr shaikh ms deluca and "does through " in testimony related to ms delucas cross complaint mr shaikh said he failed the licensing exam "three or four times " beginning first in or in a decision filed in april of this year superior court judge mary jo levinger found "no evidence" that ms deluca knew that commissions had been altered so the payments would be higher the judge ordered mr shaikh to pay &# in damages and attorneys fees mr shaikh is appealing the decision mr shaikh moved to golden gate mortgage a local mortgage broker in hayward calif in early there he introduced himself to customers as zak khan dean e johnson a lawyer for mr shaikh says he used the name "because he found that many of his american friends and customers found altaf shaikh hard to pronounce and spell " in he arranged for joann curran a retired manager to refinance the mortgage on her home in alamo calif ms curran says that at a meeting with mr shaikh at a starbucks coffee shop he told her he owned his own mortgage company and could get her a new mortgage with a low interest rate that would allow her to pull out cash to pay some of her sons medical bills "it was too good of a deal to pass up " she says still she found it odd that mr shaikh notarized her loan documents on the hood of a car while mr shaikh was working at golden gate he and his wife bought a &# million two story beige stucco house with a swimming pool on a cul de sac in fremont according to public records data compiled by realquest com the following year the couple bought a three bedroom home in las vegas for &# mr shaikh says he left golden gate in september because the owner nadeem shahzada hadnt lived up to his promises on compensation and because he had an offer from secure financial michael lauer an attorney representing mr shahzada says "it was a mutually desirable parting " mr lauer says mr shaikh didnt need a license for the duties he was supposed to perform at golden gate but declines to specify what those duties were mr shahzada "didnt know he mr shaikh was doing the things he was alleged to have done " mr lauer says in response to complaints from several borrowers the california department of real estate issued an order in january that told mr shaikh also known as "zack khan " to "desist and refrain" from making mortgages without a license tom pool an assistant real estate commissioner says the department doesnt send notices of such orders to lenders because "there are thousands and thousands of lenders out there i dont think its practical " he notes that anyone can check whether a broker is licensed or has been disciplined on the departments web site mr pool calls mr shaikhs continued presence in the mortgage industry "kind of perplexing im not sure those who allowed him to work are doing their due diligence " atiya khan says she was working as a property manager when a family friend introduced her to mr shaikh and he persuaded her to set up secure financial "he is a famous personality back home with a good decent family " she says "we went to his house he introduced his family" she adds "all these things to make you trust him " mr shaikh then persuaded ms khan a property manager at the time to obtain a license that would let her broker loans says thomas swihart her attorney the two leased an office but ms khan who lived in another part of california says her understanding at the time was that he hadnt yet gone into business but in fact using ms khans brokers license and picking up the pseudonym zak khan he had used previously he started churning out mortgage sales says ms khans lawyer "he took her license and ran with it and defrauded a lot of people " mr swihart says in may pedro franco a landscaper showed up in lawyer pamela simmonss office after receiving a closing statement for a mortgage loan with a check stapled to it mr franco thought that was odd because while he had talked to mr shaikh he didnt recall ever signing the final loan documents mr franco also discovered that some numbers on his closing statement had been whited out a &# payment to secure financial appeared as &# mr franco had also received a &# check as part of the deal not the &# he says he had discussed with mr shaikh the next day ms simmons received a visit from rosendo zamudio whose loan from mr shaikh and world savings included a &# payment to bay area marketing a company owned by mr shaikh that didnt appear on his closing statement this meant the numbers on mr zamudios loan documents didnt add up properly as ms simmons began making inquiries mr shaikh called mr zamudio and offered to come to the borrowers home to work out the misunderstanding "i called the local police because i didnt want my client meeting with him " ms simmons recalls mr shaikh was arrested in may and charged by the santa cruz county district attorney with criminal fraud and grand theft prosecutors say mr shaikh didnt disclose to borrowers payments to bay area marketing or that he was earning an extra of the loan amount from world savings for putting borrowers into more costly mortgages that also contained prepayment penalties they further allege that he failed to tell borrowers that their loans carried prepayment penalties and that those who made the minimum payment would see their loan balances rise and they say he forged notarization seals on borrowers closing statements though his notary license expired in prosecutors say they are continuing to investigate whether other individuals in the real estate industry aided the fraud crimes other aggrieved borrowers found their way to ms simmons who specializes in consumer real estate law in march ms simmons filed a lawsuit in alameda county superior court on behalf of borrowers who had contacted her about their dealings with mr shaikh ms simmons says she called world savings to inform it of mr shaikhs first arrest just after the event instead of freezing all pending transactions involving mr shaikh the civil lawsuit alleges world savings "continued to fund at least loans" presented to it by mr khan and secure financial borrowers who called world savings to check out zak khan were reassured that they could rely on him the lawsuit further alleges and world savings "ignored numerous and often vociferous complaints" from borrowers a spokesman for wachovia world savings new parent says world savings "checked the license of secure financial " rather than that of mr shaikh because the company "is the broker listed on the loans " he adds the company terminated its relationship with secure financial on may and contacted customers who "had loans in process to confirm that they were in fact seeking a loan and had received or expected to receive our disclosures " wachovia says it has since agreed to the rescission of dozens of loans originated by mr shaikh the wachovia spokesman adds that the "top broker" award was "not a company sanctioned award it was a local market certificate given by a world savings salesperson" to roughly eight brokers secure financial originated about loans for world savings in a one year period the spokesman says ms khan a defendant in the civil lawsuit has filed a cross complaint against mr shaikh alleging that she was tricked into forming secure financial and that mr shaikh forged her signature on "numerous loan documents" without her knowledge or consent ms khan says she has never made a mortgage loan and never had any contact with world savings "i was out of the picture " she says around the country efforts are now under way to improve quality control of mortgage brokers lenders are beefing up their scrutiny of mortgage brokers and other third parties the conference of state bank supervisors is setting up a national database that would allow consumers and regulators to check whether brokers are licensed or have been subject to regulatory enforcement actions sen schumer of new york in early may introduced legislation that would establish a fiduciary duty for brokers and others who arrange home mortgage loans to look after their customers interests mr shaikh is now working in the fremont area as a car salesman according to mr johnson his attorney zahid hussain in islamabad contributed to this article
