the mets classical revival new york once when i was very small my father took me to a magical slightly incomprehensible place a room with tall columns surrounding a garden with statues on later visits to what i now know was the metropolitan museum i wanted to return to this puzzling alluring spot but it was never possible shortly after id been there with my father the garden the roman sculpture court became the museum restaurant i must have been taken there early on to appease my longing but it wasnt the same which is why i can say that ive been waiting all my life for the opening of the gloriously restored leon levy and shelby white court in the mets new roman galleries it may have been worth it the court designed in the s by the architects mckim meade &amp white as the core of the museums classical galleries has at last been returned to its original function rethought by the architectural firm of kevin roche john dinkeloo &amp associates the authors of the master plan for all the mets antiquities galleries the court is now an elegant two story space like the atrium of an especially prosperous roman villa with a two tiered peristyle correctly ionic above and doric below light drenched with a handsome polychrome marble floor modeled on that of the pantheon and a severe fountain in dark gray pietraserena in the center the restored sculpture court completes the mets year reorganization of its antiquities collections its also the logical end point of the progression from prehistoric and early greek art to sixth century b c greece to third century a d rome that begins in the adjoining galleries the complex interconnections between greek innovation and roman restatement are made clear as we move through the marvelous equally light drenched greek sculpture hall past the sardis column to the recently reopened roman and etruscan galleries beyond the sculpture court is the dramatic centerpiece and focal point of the new arrangement but wonderful things are to be found in the surrounding galleries spaces devoted to the art of the hellenistic period and to republican and imperial rome tell the story with everything from public monuments and portraits to functional pottery jewelry and carved gemstones the mets fine collection of roman frescoes has been given new life set in the context of sculpture and related objects of the appropriate period most exciting is the new installation of the richly decorated bedroom from a boscotrecase villa late republican c b c weve all peered into this small sumptuous cubiculum nocturnum in its previous location leaning over the barrier straining to see the paintings those on the end wall with its window and distorted grille were too far away those on the side walls too compressed now we can enter the bedroom and study the illusionistic piles of buildings the views of little temples and the bits of still life we can delight in the curling vine and birds in the fragment of landscape we can note the theater masks and remember that the frescoes may allude to stage sets we can enjoy the serene chalky red expanses of framing wall and the intricate details of the painted architecture fruit and flowers and imagine waking up every day in this enchanting room upstairs the etruscan collection has never looked better the recently reconfigured bronze chariot second quarter of the sixth century b c with its stylized reliefs of the life of achilles and its threatening masks has pride of place but theres also a wealth of smaller lively bronze and ceramic objects agile warriors graceful votaries and tense animals bear witness to the sculptural inventiveness of this mysterious culture best of all perhaps is the mezzanine level study collection in a room full of windows multiple examples of key objects some as impressive as any exhibited elsewhere grouped by type period or function are easily viewed from all sides wall mounted touch screens make it simple to locate specific works and to obtain detailed information if only this sort of thing had been available when i was an undergraduate the met takes justifiable pride that its classical collections are as good and as comprehensive as they are given that the relatively young museum was centuries removed from the antique past devoid of royal collections and thousands of miles from the old world now on a sunny day with light streaming from above and through the windows on the park and fifth avenue we can watch people move among the sculptures and imagine ourselves in some public building in ancient rome unarguable masterpieces may be in short supply but the new roman galleries are exhilarating as spectacle and there are plenty of splendid works to reward our attention im only sorry that my father didnt live long enough for me to revisit the sculpture court with him ms wilkin is the curator of "color as field american painting " opening this fall at the denver art museum
