the afternoon report londons towering rate online edition global financial markets have recently suffered a severe case of interest rate jitters and the latest deliberations by european central banks likely wont do much to put such anxieties to rest with inflation scraping the clouds the bank of england lifted its primary short term interest rate to the fifth increase in less than months and a move that brings borrowing costs in britain to a six year high the central bank watched consumer inflation climb to in annual terms in march well north of its official target and though price increases moderated to a clip in may interest rate setters felt compelled to take further action economists spotted the move coming a mile away and many noted that the statement the bank issued today was almost identical to the one that accompanied mays rate increase "the committee judged that relative to the target the balance of risks to the outlook for inflation in the medium term continued to lie to the upside " the statement read some onlookers interpreted that as a clear sign that the central bank intends to continue raising rates with capacity use at a high level and the nations housing market booming a number of economists think that interest rates in britain will climb to by the end of the year others are less convinced arguing that the full effects of the banks recent rate moves havent yet washed through the economy entirely and that the bank may wish to stand back and let those moves do their magic before going any further trevor williams chief economist at lloyds tsb noted that factory output and mortgage lending have slowed down lately an early sign that the rate increases are pulling on the reins as intended concern about the lagging effects of policy moves was a factor in leading the federal reserve to wind up a long campaign of rate increases a year ago some economists argue that the complete impact of changes in monetary policy can take a year or more to work all the way through the economic ecosystem if the bank of england presses rates too high too fast it could cripple consumption and hamstring overall economic growth if indeed it turns out that the central bank was getting carried away it would be an early challenge for the new government of prime minister gordon brown a former finance minister and architect of the current british monetary regime meanwhile interest rates could also be heading higher across the channel the european central bank left its primary policy rate on hold at today but like their counterparts in britain central bankers on the continent are still concerned about the prices outlook the ecb seeks to keep inflation at an altitude "close to but below" over the medium term and though euro zone inflation ran at an annual pace of in june it is expected to climb further later in the year ecb president jean claude trichet said that the central bank is "closely" monitoring inflation risks not "very closely " as the bank had said in the past showing it remains on guard against any inflation flare ups but the euro zone is a complex economic constituency and thus policy makers may begin to divide on how much higher rates should go and how quickly exports data have been uneven lately and some member nations may complain that the stronger euro that has flowed from the monetary tightening is punishing trade dollar strengthens stocks drift even amid all those suggestions that interest rates are headed higher overseas the dollar was gaining ground today after a report from the institute for supply management
