wonder land its not the economy stupid for the professional politician carving and chiseling a path to the white house the task at hand is figuring out what ails the collective mind of the american electorate this week and when the th week of the campaign lumbers into view next year yesterday found candidates biden dodd clinton obama brownback and romney floating like tireless balloons through fourth of july parades all over iowa after that our or so presidential diviners and their retinues will continue to belly flop into towns across america trying to connect trying to discover the one thing that will still animate voters when the final bell rings nov how about this issue cars filled with nails and tanks of propane gas blown up by people whose goal in life is to murder western infidels but i could be wrong two weeks ago mike bloombergs turn in the center of the political conversation came when he divested the gop and declared to a group of google employees out west "whoever out of those becomes president i think has to do something about a country that i think is really in trouble " the trouble as the mayor sees it has to do with the countrys "reputation" and its "go it alone mentality " maybe mike bloomberg has it right maybe the winning presidential issue will be getting into a better relationship this is an unusual election to handicap setting aside the trick of a candidate avoiding statements now that would look irretrievably dumb months from now the campaigns have to contend with an american public fixated on a paradox about of polled people say the country is on the "wrong track " notwithstanding that the scenery along the track includes some three years of strong to moderate economic growth unemployment and a stock market thats been on an upward march for three years so whats the problem two weeks ago when mike bloomberg was in the news wisdom had it that the mind of the "independent voter" was the rosetta stone for decoding american politics this past weekend the washington post outputted a massive and dense polling analysis of the independent voter if one assumes as i do that the partisan intensity of our politics has widened the number of voters who feel the parties are "not speaking to them " then the posts numbers may serve as a useful proxy for their views at least between may and june the generalization that emerges from the post surveys data is that independent voters this includes democratic and republican leaners have deep concerns about everything combining those who say an issue is "extremely important" to them or "very important" puts the totals well above for health care the economy terrorism immigration taxes corruption and of course "the situation" in iraq with a combined importance ranking most of it negative this is the worry wart vote a condition brought on by spending too much time with politics now that electronic media the web radio tv has made overdosing on politics unavoidable mike bloomberg could reasonably conclude there is pay dirt in offering antidotes to the worry warts in a speech in los angeles mayor bloomberg tried to gather all this anxiety in one phrase "washington is sinking into a swamp of dysfunction " rethinking political management amid deep partisan division would be a dandy avocation if we lived in normal times say sept but we dont last weekend the forces of civilization foiled planned barbarian bombings and mass death for innocent civilians in london and glasgow one month ago they foiled a plot to blow up the gasoline fuel pipeline at jfk airport a month before that they arrested six men enraptured by jihadist videos who concluded it was their lifes goal to blow up soldiers at fort dix n j before that they foiled a well advanced plot to demolish u s bound airliners over the atlantic this week spain completed its trial of people charged with the madrid train bombing that killed i havent conducted a poll but my guess is this is the real reason many in the u s feel the country is on the wrong track the possibility of mass mortal risk is the one constant in life today its always floating beneath the changing surface of stock prices gasoline prices or sen obamas blueprints for universal health care in a wide ranging interview with the journals editorial board last week at our offices in lower manhattan rudy giuliani talked a lot about terrorism it may well be that made the giuliani presidential run possible but i think the better political comparison isnt new york in september but new york in when mr giuliani unseated mayor david dinkins he described it to us "i was elected to reduce crime that was the rationale for my being mayor of new york they werent going to elect a republican prosecutor in new york unless they were desperate and they were desperate it was well even give him a chance to do it " this was the period of screwing stacks of deadbolt locks onto apartment doors in new york amid this republican giuliani defeated democrat dinkins by to this means that a lot of new york liberals beset by the loss of physical well being went into the voting booth pulled the lever for giuliani and walked out to tell their friends "i voted for dinkins " this isnt an endorsement for rudy giuliani its an explanation for why this candidate despite the presumed baggage has polled strongly for months in his meeting with us mr giuliani said something else unexpected "george bushs speech on september is still the best road map for what to do about terrorism " thats right its not the economy this time stupid its terrorism no matter how low george bush falls in the polls the next months "what to do about terrorism" is going to be the no voting issue in november because the glasgow jfk fort dix heathrow madrid bombers are still going to be at play in november this may well be the election decided by the worry wart independents but dont be surprised if a lot of them walk out of the voting booth that day and say with a straight face "i voted to solve the health care crisis " right they also voted for dinkins
