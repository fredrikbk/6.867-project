consumers may get caught in piracy war strategy to thwart movie copying could frustrate innocent users movie studios and other companies that control the latest technology for playing home videos have come up with a new strategy for thwarting unauthorized copying one that can slow down hackers but has the potential for frustrating consumers innocent of any piracy the industrys new strategy has so far eschewed lawsuits aimed at the hacker community which proved largely ineffective in stopping widespread copying of first generation dvds in favor of a hard ball technological approach called "key revocation" that aims to protect newer high definition dvds from piracy the new strategy has unfolded over recent months as hackers have attacked the protections used in personal computers and laptops that play high definition discs the computers are enabled to play hd dvd and blu ray discs with special drives made by companies including toshiba corp and the plextor unit of japans shinano kenshi co and software made by cyberlink corp of taiwan and the intervideo unit of corel corp of ottawa high definition dvd players that connect to tvs so far havent been caught up in the fight these companies are licensed by the industry group that oversees movie copy protection the advanced access content system licensing administrator or aacs la the founders of the consortium include walt disney co warner bros sony corp toshiba and microsoft corp the anticopying protection for high resolution dvds relies on secret digit passwords embedded in the hardware or software used to play dvds under its new " key revocation strategy hollywood and its allies in the high technology industry start with the assumption that enterprising hackers will eventually decipher the passwords which can then be used to make copies but once a password is compromised and posted on the web the industry answers by changing the way in which its new dvd titles are made anyone who pops one of the new discs into their personal computer without installing a software upgrade will find that it destroys the computers ability to play any high definition dvd at all to restore the computers ability to play them again the owner is forced to download new software from the web software with a new password that hackers havent yet discovered the old password or key has been revoked high definition dvds were first rolled out last year by february of this year hackers had posted on the web passwords stolen from cyberlink and intervideo software enabling the copying of discs by april the industry was issuing its new key revocation dvds to thwart the hackers in titles such as "the nutty professor" and "matrix reloaded " the self destruct signal affects player software for both formats for high definition dvds hd dvd and blu ray not hardware players hooked up to tvs the effect could be bewildering to a customer not used to downloading frequent updates over the internet edward felten a computer science professor at princeton university who has written critically about the system calls the harm to consumers "the collateral damage in the war between the studios and the crackers " highly motivated hackers he says will continue to find ways to discover the latest passwords and "if you have a software player youre likely to have to continue upgrading " technology blogger cory doctorow who opposes key revocation restrictions says that the self destruct signal will frustrate honest consumers and push them toward bootlegs when they find that their legitimate dvds wont play "at the end of the day this stuff is being engineered to fail and thats not good engineering " mr doctorow says "do you want to buy a product whose designers intend that sometimes it mysteriously stops working " michael ayers a toshiba attorney in irvine calif and spokesman for aacs la says "we dont want a consumer to end up with a dark screen " mr ayers says that would happen only rarely and most customers will receive notice from the software companies of the free internet update before encountering a disc with the self destruct signal "the worst case example " he says would be a "person who takes a superextended vacation he buys a new disc and suddenly hes not able to use the discs hes brought with him " despite cyberlink and intervideos attempts to make their updated software impenetrable hackers have since managed to extract a new password anyway posting it on a comment on mr feltens freedom to tinker blog in may mr ayers wouldnt say which companys password was compromised and the companies declined to comment in addition a company called slysoft sells an &# program called anydvd hd which it professes can decode hd dvd and blu ray discs the company says its program has continued to work despite the recent key revocation indicating that the company may have discovered yet another password that it hasnt published slysoft based in the caribbean nation of antigua and barbuda says its software is perfectly legal "in antigua we dont have any copyright act like your dmca " says tom xiang a slysoft spokesman referring to the federal digital millennium copyright act which bans dvd copying mr ayers says aacs la was aware of slysoft and hasnt ruled out legal action against it the new compromises have prompted the aacs la to ponder a second round of counterstrikes that would mean another round of required updates for consumers if they want to keep being able to play their movies "we dont at all deny that theres a cat and mouse game " says mr ayers "we are fully expecting that we will have to deal with this again and again "
