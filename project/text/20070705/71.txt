politics &amp economics u k to review overseas recruitment of doctors after bomb plot when britains national health service was desperately short of doctors and nurses several years ago it began recruiting overseas advertising in medical journals and newspapers for foreign medical professionals under those efforts mohammed asha arrived in the united kingdom from jordan to begin practicing medicine in november he was a top student and wanted to specialize in neurology his sister says bilal abdulla who trained in baghdad got his license to practice medicine in the u k in august another doctor muhammad haneef took on part time work at halton hospital in cheshire today the three are among the eight suspects that british police have arrested in connection with the plot to set off car bombs in central london and at glasgow scotlands airport all of the suspects have links to nhs hospitals and two were arrested at a hospital dormitory at royal alexandra hospital in paisley outside glasgow police havent charged anyone in connection with the attempted attacks the u k s effort to attract foreign doctors is running up against its effort to fight terrorism yesterday prime minister gordon brown said his terrorism minister would review how the nhs recruits foreign health care workers and increase background checks on them britain also will expand the world wide watch list of potential terrorists to help warn other countries he said british authorities have found and arrested the main people they suspect were behind the attempted attacks though additional people may have participated in providing support and more arrests could follow a person familiar with the situation said yesterday the british government lowered its terror alert level to "severe" from "critical " the highest level the home office yesterday said there is no intelligence to suggest an imminent attack but cautioned that the threat of terrorism remains serious the nhs has long been an achilles heel for mr brown when he came to power in as the no to then prime minister tony blair patients often had to wait months for treatment partly because of staff shortages being a doctor back then wasnt considered prestigious pay was low doctors were overworked and many hospitals were run down messrs blair and brown vowed to fix the nhs and nearly doubled spending on it they managed to cut patient waiting lists but many patients and physicians still complain that facilities are outdated and care is poor young doctors arriving in britain from overseas often work as junior doctors a term for physicians who are still in training sometimes they live in hospital dormitories at the royal alexandra hospital in paisley a onetime industrial town on the outskirts of glasgow the dormitory is a run down brown stucco building surrounded by unmowed grass and weeds muslim doctors typically pray in their dormitory rooms when there is no nearby mosque says shafi kauser a pakistani doctor and president of the great britain and ireland chapter of pakistani doctors overseas a doctors organization "sometimes they are in a conspicuous minority and feel homesick " he says "overseas doctors have made an invaluable contribution to the nhs over the years and it would be dreadful if the trust that exists between patients and doctors whatever their background was harmed by these events " british medical association council chairman hamish meldrum said in a statement this week he said the association found it appalling that "members of a caring profession may be involved in these atrocities " the nhs which is funded by taxpayers has invested a good deal of public trust and money in foreign staffers today of the physicians registered to practice medicine in the u k received their medical degrees overseas according to the general medical council a group that registers doctors in the u s by contrast about one quarter of doctors trained overseas according to the american medical association the overseas recruitment drive from to along with a big pay boost for doctors helped the nhs overcome its staff shortages there is now less need to recruit abroad and last year a change in immigration rules requiring foreign doctors to get work permits made it tougher for them to land jobs with the nhs doctors coming from overseas must register with the general medical council which tests their medical knowledge and english language skills the gmc also verifies each doctors medical degree and identification foreign doctors then typically look for job openings in medical journals the lancet and british medical journal any hospital hiring foreign doctors is required to check their criminal records though checking records outside the u k can be difficult information tied to those arrested may exist on u k intelligence records of extremist actions or groups according to a person familiar with the situation dr asha years old moved to the u k after he graduated from medical school in jordan and married a high school classmate says his sister nahed he had little interest in anything but his studies often studying for hours on end and appearing only to eat with his family
