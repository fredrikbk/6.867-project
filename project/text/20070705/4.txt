an obbligato of bias throbs in background of any bbc broadcast robin aitkens tempered critique of the consistent and pervasive bias of the bbcs news coverage hit the mark with this listener since "the beebs bias " editorial page june the era when one got a kick from picking up a clear sw signal to hear "this is london " lilliburlero and greenwich pips is long past and most of all the expectation of fair insightful treatment of world events unavailable anywhere else is quite over in fact listening today to bbc world service news is much more reminiscent of tuning into "moscow mailbag " that lumbering propaganda screed of radio moscow circa doubtless like bland apologists for radio moscow in its heyday the bbcs current regime can plausibly defend any single news item against any particular charge of bias whether a charge of misreporting facts or of affecting a tone of smug and snide insinuation but anyone who listens frequently and especially anyone who remembers the bbcs external service in the decades before the asylum inmates overpowered the guards would have to be tone deaf not to recognize the throbbing obbligato almost a drumbeat of bias in both newscopy and interviews mr aitken describes it exactly sometimes its evident as subtext how the story is told what strings of tinted words are used to color the listeners reaction at other times especially in interviews the bias is gross and frank of course no thoughtful listener craves powder puff treatment of controversial stories that might embarrass the british government or its allies or that deal with socially rivening issues yet the vividly slanted tone and substance of bbcs news cries for searching reform otherwise an internationally respected "brand" that took more than eight decades to build will be irretrievably trashed if it isnt already one wonders why the british public countenances paying to have its way of life and national actions daily denigrated by the leftish clique that has captured bush house like others i will continue to listen to many of the fine feature programs still broadcast from london even so i regretfully conclude that mr aitken is right in saying that until bbc news honestly engages rather than dismisses his and others critique of that broadcasters lapse from "impartiality and overall fairness it will not be prudent to trust the bbc " it may be that management at bush house doesnt care a fig so long as it can still use its inherited if now tarnished aura of authority and fairness to recruit discontented audiences by giving them what they want to hear but what does it take to push a nearly five decades long listener to the conclusion that bbc is no longer a trusted source of news a good reputation is built in small increments over time but can be destroyed rather rapidly the bbc seems blind to this notion james connelly hingham mass mr aitken exposes the arrogant and biased culture of the bbc but it is puzzling that he argues against scrapping the bbc entirely emphasizing that some of its programs are excellent and the u k needs more not less media competition in a similar way one could have argued against the dismantlement of the communist party of the soviet union because of the bolshoi ballet and because the country needed more parties not less yuri gurevich professor emeritus university of michigan redmond wash the anti u s anti israel and frequently anti semitic bias of the bbc unfortunately represents a more deep seated problem the general media in the u k as well as its labor unions and academia demonstrate the same attitude certainly the recent call for boycotts of israel by britains academics trade unions and journalists is the outgrowth of an increasing arab and leftist influence in britain the latter with a long historic record of anti semitism tony blair was a refreshing change in the picture as he preached tolerance but now the pendulum has swung back revealing the true feelings of an activist segment of the british community it will be interesting to see whether the recent failed terrorist bombing attacks in the heart of britain will change the minds of the general population about the radical islamic threat as well as their attitudes toward the u s and israel as bastions against world wide islamic terror nelson marans silver spring md the problem is that the bbcs product is viewed as gospel throughout much of the world for those who genuflect before the altar of british heritage a not undeserved respect for that nations export of values and government the bbc is more a deviation from the promise of a free press it tailors its reporting to conform to the opinion of its leftwing intellectuals mr aitken flirts with the idea of defunding the institution a remedy thats too abrupt on the other hand borrowing from the direction adopted by the bbc in its international political advocacy i suggest "a planned withdrawal of public funding by a date specific " the bbc constituency should be called on to assume responsibility for its own information organ jaime l manzano bethesda md
