the bandit of capitol hill feasting on the spoils by seth hettena st martins pages &# the wrong stuff by marcus stern jerry kammer dean calbreath george e condon jr publicaffairs pages &# if you think congress has settled into a state of perpetual scandal you would be wrong but only because "scandal" isnt a strong enough word to describe the transgressions that lawmakers are accused of this year alone weve had one congressman ohio republican bob ney sentenced to months in prison for corruption and another louisiana democrat william jefferson indicted on counts of racketeering money laundering and obstruction of justice among other things since the house banking scandal in there have been dozens of lawmakers accused of malfeasance and more than a few of them from dan rostenkowski the former chairman of the house ways and means committee to former ohio democrat jim traficant have beaten a path from the house to the big house is there any other group of comparably privileged americans with such a high incidence of wrongdoing among this brigand band no one has quite sunk to the level of randy "duke" cunningham the vietnam war flying ace and former eight term representative from san diego in november cunningham pleaded guilty to trading his influence over tens of millions of dollars in defense related earmarks for houses cars boats and cash and he is now serving a sentence of eight years and four months at a federal work camp the longest sentence ever handed down to a member of congress cunninghams rise and fall are the subject of two well reported books "feasting on the spoils" by former associated press reporter seth hettena and "the wrong stuff " by marcus stern jerry kramer dean calbreath and george e condon jr the team from the san diego union tribune and copley news service that broke the cunningham story its a tale of arrogance greed and abuse of power an astonishing fall from the day years ago when duke cunningham achieved a feat of bravery and skill that without his later disgrace might have defined his life on the afternoon of may while escorting some bombers on a run over a strategically important railyard in the red river delta cunningham shot down three north vietnamese migs before finessing his badly damaged and burning f out of enemy territory and over safe waters where he and his co pilot could eject cunninghams kills that day would bring his total to five making him the first navy ace since the korean war and an instant hero in a conflict that needed all the positive pr it could get as mr hettena tells the story cunninghams exploits would inspire in him a wildly inflated sense of entitlement when he and his co pilot were brought back to the states and a heroes welcome they informed their superior officer that they would refuse the navy cross and hold out for a medal of honor their superior explained that you dont hold out for the medal of honor you die for it after the war as an officer at the navys top gun flight school cunningham displayed the sort of abrasive self importance and poor performance that would have gotten anyone else bounced out but none of his superiors wanted to be responsible for sidelining the navys only ace cunninghams sense of entitlement followed him into congress where he quickly developed a reputation among the house leadership for being in mr hettenas words "a strange character highly unstable and someone to avoid " his mouth got him into trouble long before his corruption did he once stunned his colleagues by referring to "homos in the military" during a speech on the house floor in a debate on funding the u s intervention in bosnia he claimed that rep jim moran d va "turned his back" on the troops who fought in desert storm leading to a fistfight outside the house chamber cunningham won a seat on the appropriations committee in where a plum subcommittee assignment gave him a say over billions of dollars in defense appropriations cunningham had developed close relationships with two aspiring defense contractors brent wilkes and mitchell wade and their businesses grew rich from cunningham sponsored earmarks they more than repaid the favor in spring cunningham submitted a &# million earmark aimed at mr wilkess company two weeks later according to mr hettena mr wilkes wrote the checks that bought mr cunningham his first boat in mr wade bought a rolls royce and a second boat the "duke stir " for his favorite congressman there were french antiques persian rugs expensive meals wine travel cash and even prostitutes a real estate deal turned out to be cunninghams undoing in he sold his san diego home to mr wades limited liability company for &# million and used the proceeds to buy an even pricier house in rancho santa fe mr wade immediately put the original house back on the market where it languished for a year until he finally managed to unload it at a &# loss a clear sign that the arrangement had been a sham this was the story that marcus stern broke in june which led to the unraveling of cunninghams secrets and the criminal investigation that would ultimately bring him down it was only later that prosecutors found the infamous "bribe menu" sketched out by cunningham one afternoon at a georgetown restaurant mr wade by then a cooperating witness explained to prosecutors the lists significance in "feasting on the spoils " mr hettena has drawn a vivid portrait of cunningham who comes across as someone whose character was constructed of little more than flaws except for one transcendent moment of war fighting skill cunningham appears to have been neither charming nor smart neither funny nor wise he wasnt especially passionate about anything except cashing in on his fame he was also bad at his job he bragged and strutted but had little of substance to contribute during the years he served in congress it does not say flattering things about party leaders who put forward such candidates and it does not say flattering things about us that we keep electing them "the wrong stuff" is also eminently readable and includes an account of how cunninghams corruption broke in the press in the wake of the congressional travel scandal in marcus stern at copley was conducting a "lifestyle audit" on cunningham and ran into something interesting about his rancho santa fe real estate transaction the purchaser was not an individual but mitchell wades llc the article that mr stern went on to write about the deal was read by prosecutors in the u s attorneys office in san diego within two weeks a grand jury was issuing subpoenas and the fbi was raiding cunninghams residences rarely has a news story led so quickly to the downfall of a public figure if theres a scandal at the bottom of all this lawbreaking it is the way legislators like duke cunningham use and abuse the power of the earmark the effect is to divert defense dollars away from the real business of the military and into the pockets of preferred contractors read these books for the lurid wrongdoing they put on display but prepare to see confirmed your worst fears about what washington does with your money mr miller is a lawyer in washington
