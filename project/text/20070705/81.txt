smoking as sociology musee du fumeur www museedufumeur net paris intoxicate me my cigarette and give me a scornful air i want to stay cold and silent while hearing sweet confessions these lyrics from lucianne boyers song "dans la fumee" demonstrate not only the psychological power of the cigarette but also its role as a cultural icon a poster featuring madame boyers troubled visage can be found in one of this citys quirkier museums the six year old musee du fumeur actually a storefront with a couple of tiny rooms in the back the square foot space was formerly a butcher shop which youll be reminded of as you breathe in wafts of roasting chicken from the store nearby ironically you wont be graced with the aroma of cigarette smoke until you step outdoors since the museum of smoking is in the untouristy th arrondisement at least you wont have to battle throngs of tourists pushing and shoving their way to the entrance and one can be amused even fascinated by the collection of artifacts displayed in rooms painted the color of drying tobacco a series of neatly organized and numbered display cases contains novelties like a sylis note from the republic of guinea depicting a rather perturbed looking man smoking a peace pipe the current exhibition "caricatures de fumeurs " which runs through the end of the year features pen and ink drawings from the th century to the present the often humorous artwork shows individuals from all walks of life students casino devotees artists and even children inhaling and exhaling as they go about their day focusing on all these images of europeans puffed out cheeks its easy to forget that smoking is an american invention as michka a co founder of the museum likes to say it was the native americans who actually first smoked tobacco an endeavor that didnt really become a hit in europe until more than a century after columbus brought the stuff to these shores the idea of ingesting smoke was originally a hard sell "hell " says michka "was very much on peoples minds so when they saw someone taking something burning at the end to their mouth and blowing smoke it really seemed to be for them a picture of hell " eventually the odd practice caught on and within a couple of centuries a huge smoke ring enveloped the world along with a burgeoning smoking "culture " throughout the museum youll find various tools of the trade a scale bronze and heather pipes hookahs from the middle east and the orient "le bong" from southeast asia as well as a sculpture of a hollowed out head for storing loose tobacco the "art" of smoking though is best demonstrated by a collection of frederic dagains tobacco leaf paintings but perhaps more compelling than the unique canvases are the words that accompany each of the artists "divinites mayas" mayan gods surrounding the multihued image of mictlantecihtl for example are the words "mictlantecihtl you smoke and you smile you are the god of death take good care of our bodies " more on this later meanwhile across the corridor youll see the real deal huge caramel colored leaves drying in a makeshift sechoir or "dryer " "i love the smell " michka says with a chuckle as we walk by but tabac is not the only smell michka appreciates a few feet away youll see a mint sheet of canadian stamps with a portrait of a young michka superimposed over a marijuana leaf remember this is the museum of smoking not just tobacco surprisingly michka who prefers the single appellation its more "convenient " she says is not a cigarette smoker after smoking a few menthols as a teenager she never lit one again "many times ive had this feeling that the fact that i am not a cigarette smoker has given me a kind of virginity in relation to tobacco and so its easier for me to have a bit of objectivity " "objectivity " however is perhaps too simple a concept to reflect michkas attitude toward cigarette smoking for unlike someone who might simply acknowledge the realities of both smokers and nonsmokers michka approaches the topic with an anthropologists not apologists sensibility a perspective cultivated no doubt by her unique life path born in in the south of france michka came to paris with her family as a year old right after the war but as she tells me in accented but nearly flawless english she has "grown a north american root " after living three years in england with an "irishman" she taught french the duo wanted to head to new guinea but at that time female teachers were not accepted so the couple ended up in a remote part of british columbia living on a boat "built from scratch" that they eventually sailed back to europe it was the early s and michka started writing for sailing magazines also at that time she and her lovemate bought some land near the sleepy town of grand forks her next phase of life had her living with a french writer for years alternating between france and grand forks she too began churning out books starting in with a text exploring the virtues of marijuana another delved into spirulina the dietary supplement made from algae in fact it was her foray while in her s into edible as well as smokable plants that ultimately led michka to tobacco "plants are the big love of my life tobacco as far as im concerned is foremost a plant smoking comes second " she says above all michka is most concerned with how tobacco intersects with different cultures "one thing that fascinated me was to discover the chasm between how we in the west see tobacco and how it is perceived in the culture say of peru or colombia there tobacco is used by medicine men tabaceros to cure people " so what about the thousands of people who die every year from cigarette smoking michka cavalierly attributes that to a combination of factors "one thing i think is for sure is that if you eat food that is too rich combined with a sedentary life with a lot of stress and add tobacco smoke on top of that then youll be in a bad way " but its not really the health implications that have caused michka to avoid what she calls the "fast food" of tobacco i e cigarettes as she likes to note those who smoke pipes and cigars have a different relationship with tobacco "i think theres such an introspective quality about the pipe " she says "it was einstein who said that before you answer a question always light a pipe that really says something about the potential for it to help you connect with your creativity " michka herself prefers a good cigar "occasionally " which she sees as a "noble way to experience tobacco " it is with this mindset that michka created the museum the other co founder another first namer tigrane is also not a cigarette smoker and while neither takes an official stand on the tobacco controversy the museums bookstore has no shortage of pamphlets on how to stop the dangers of secondhand smoke and similarly themed books albeit along with pipes and rolling papers theres even a nonprofit association allied with the museum dedicated to smoking prevention as for frances coming anti smoking law which extends the current ban in public places to cafes and restaurants and is now just six months away michka would prefer things to stay as they are in fact when it comes to government regulation she is unwavering "im flabbergasted to see the extent this tobacco prohibition has gone to already and im really curious to see how far its going to go before rebellion starts rising not just in france but everywhere in europe if not elsewhere " just how the new law will affect the museum is hard to say but for those like michka who view smoking from a sociological perspective the museum will no doubt fill a gap sure to open when the smoke spigot shuts off next year "it seems so extreme its like that phrase throwing out the baby with the bath water with a bit of luck the museum is saving the baby which is all the art forms that have developed with smoking and so theres still a place where they can be remembered and shown " mr cooper a frequent contributor to the leisure &amp arts page lived in paris this spring
