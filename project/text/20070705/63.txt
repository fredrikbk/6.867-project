pension fund shifts to favor venture firms access to top tier venture capital firms is tough in any market but san francisco employees retirement system isnt deterred the san francisco pension fund which devotes of its roughly &# billion private equity allocation to venture capital is making more direct venture capital investments these days a change from its previous strategy of primarily using venture capital funds of funds in doing so the pension fund is moving in the opposite direction from many other large limited partners which are looking to cut the number of private equity relationships they have and turning to separate accounts or funds of funds to do so san francisco says its strategy is motivated not only by a desire to avoid the extra layer of fees on funds of funds but also by a wish to conduct more in depth due diligence on firms at a level it feels it cant achieve via funds of funds david kushner deputy director of investments for san francisco employees retirement system said that because most vc firms co invest with their peers in companies investing in one venture firm often gives a limited partner the opportunity to learn more about the firms that fund is investing alongside that in turn can lead to new relationships "its not rocket science but i dont think a lot of people have thought about this " he said "it gives us a proprietary edge " while mr kushner believes that edge alone would be worth the headaches that trying to get into top venture funds can cause he says the san francisco pension fund has found a way to minimize those aches and pains anyway mr kushner wont reveal much of the funds investing secrets but he didnt mind delving into some angles first and foremost san francisco employees retirement system which manages the retirement plans for active and retired san francisco city and county employees has been investing in venture capital funds for years a rarity among public pension funds with that sort of longevity san francisco has been able to make a name for itself as an educated easy going investor "we try not to be high maintenance " mr kushner said "i dont need to get a phone call every week to know whats going on i dont need a general partner to hold my hand and walk with me every step of the way " the limited partners location also doesnt hurt when it comes time for meetings "because we are in the bay area it does tend to position us in a relative sense as somewhat attractive " mr kushner said one drawback that the pension fund does have to face is its comparatively large size with about &# billion in assets under management san francisco has an edge when it comes to buyout investing but has to overcome misperceptions on size in the venture world some general partners say they think that san francisco is interested only in commitments of &# million or more which can scare them away in fact san francisco rarely makes a commitment of more than &# million to any private equity fund venture capital or not mr kushner said he combats this misperception by making sure that when he sits down with general partners he not only learns about their strategies but educates them on the pension funds too "we want to be the right size for the fund " he said "we want to work strategically with the general partner " mr kushner understands that vc returns may never again hit the heights they did during the internet bubble but that doesnt bother him that is because he believes returns will still generally be better than public market gains "do i think venture capital will have a to " internal rate of return he said "probably not but better than the s&amp p absolutely "
