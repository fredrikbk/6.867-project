identity problem mysteries of the faceblind could illuminate the brain strange deficit impairs ability to recognize are you my mommy several years ago when margaret mitchell picked up her son duncan from his seattle school he looked at her curiously and asked "are you my mommy " ms mitchell an attorney by training was taken aback when she answered "yes im your mommy " he recognized her voice and was reassured a short while later duncan then years old was diagnosed with prosopagnosia a so called selective developmental condition often referred to as "faceblindness " although his eyesight is perfectly fine he cant always identify people by their faces in school for instance duncan has trouble matching the faces and names of teachers and pupils like many other prosopagnosics duncan now has a memory that functions normally in other ways he can visually distinguish between cars and houses and toys he knows his dog and cat and other neighborhood pets hes a sociable child and likes being around people but the frustration of not being able to discern faces has made everyday life from attending school to making friends unbearably difficult his parents engineer much of his social life around one on one playdates so he can try to remember classmates an elusive and unsettling medical mystery prosopagnosia may offer clues to the delicate interworkings of personality and the brain some researchers believe that studying it could help illuminate other developmental aberrancies that scientists havent yet identified research into the condition "has legitimized the search for other brain mechanisms that may also be designed to process information about very specific aspects of the world " says brad duchaine a cognitive neuroscientist at university college london "its possible that these selective deficits are sometimes major contributors to peoples personalities and may even account for the little personality quirks that so many of us have " prosopagnosia was first coined in by a german neurologist who observed that a young man who suffered a bullet wound to the head lost his ability to recognize people but its only in the past decade that researchers began focusing on developmental prosopagnosia or people born without the ability to recognize faces studies suggest that up to of the population might suffer from some degree of faceblindness as faceblind children get older their challenges shift toby scheib years old says hes reluctant to tell his peers about his condition "either they ask are you making this up theyre like ive never even heard of this at first they dont believe me " he says toby and his mother elaine who is also faceblind once lost each other at an easter egg hunt eventually the police had to look for toby because mother and son couldnt recognize each other in the sea of parents and children adult prosopagnosics say that their condition can be socially alienating nicky hoberman is an oxford graduate and an accomplished london artist whose work ironically includes paintings of faces she says one time she was at the gym and noticed a man staring intently at her "he just stood there staring at me while im doing my ab crunches and i thought you pervert " she says she ignored him shortly after the incident her brother mentioned that his best friend saw her at the gym wanted to say hello and was waiting for her to finish her exercises "id met him countless times " she says like other prosopagnosics ms hoberman relies on other characteristics to recognize people including their hair and walking gait shes also a very keen listener "i never forget a thing anyone ever tells me " she says much of the research on faceblindness takes place at the university college londons institute of cognitive neuroscience there dr duchaine runs the social perception lab where he and his staff are working to identify prosopagnosics those diagnosed with the disorder are asked to come back for more advanced tests that look at their ability to perceive identity emotion and gender while looking at faces dr duchaines early work sought to establish that parts of the brain specialize in face processing through a series of experiments some involving scanning peoples brains while showing them images researchers identified two regions in the brains temporal lobe the fusiform face area and the occipital face area that appear to be critical for face recognition "the best way for normal people to have a sense of how a prosopagnosic sees faces is to look at images of inverted faces " dr duchaine says his research shows that normal people can identify upright faces but do very poorly identifying upside down ones prosopagnosics on the other hand often score the same on both as a student dr duchaine was always interested in face processing when he was in graduate school at the university of california at santa barbara a family friend mentioned a teenager who was unable to identify faces "i put together a bunch of tests hopped in my car and drove to los angeles to test the kid " he recalls even using the crude tests hed developed dr duchaine was confident the teenager was prosopagnosic he went on to do a four year post doctoral fellowship with harvard psychologist ken nakayama an expert in visual perception the duo developed the cambridge face memory test which was published in in the journal neuropsychologia and has become a standard face test it is now recognized as a standard diagnostic tool for the condition during a recent hospital lecture dr duchaine showed a slide of elvis presley with the hair cropped off during his talk he said he once asked a woman if she could identify the image and she replied "is it brooke shields " research also suggests that developmental faceblindness is often genetic and comes in degrees last year dr duchaine and dr nakayama flew to las vegas to screen members of toby scheibs family ranging in ages from to of the group seven were prosopagnosic but not equally so tobys grandmother an aunt and he were the three most severe cases his mother elaine scored near the middle of the afflicted a common question is whether prosopagnosia is somehow related to autism since people with that disorder can also often struggle with faces in both recognizing them and reading peoples emotional facial expressions based on some early tests dr duchaine says he believes that the research will show that facial identity emotional facial expression and social cognition arent consistently linked "a lot of our prosopagnosics also have trouble with facial expression but they do well in everyday life and show no hint of autistic traits " he says "the only reason they have trouble in social interactions is because they have trouble extracting information from the face " before learning that duncan was prosopagnosic his mother recalls a number of incidents that offered clues into his condition as soon as duncan learned to talk he would often ask people hed seen many times before "how do you know me " or "how do you know my name " when he was and attending a montessori school his teacher told ms mitchell that duncan didnt call any of the children in the class by their names "i thought it was odd that he would refer to another kid as that guy or that person over there " recalls gina lauvstad his former teacher while he struggled to place his classmates he was learning other things on schedule singing songs and recognizing numbers the following year duncan still couldnt name the children in his class his vision and hearing were tested and found to be fine he scored high on an iq test a psychologist who saw duncan three times first used the term "faceblind " ms mitchell says that she went online to find information "i just started to cry and cry " she says duncan at first did well in kindergarten last year at his local public elementary school largely because a special education aide worked with him ms mitchell says but last february the school brought in a new aide explaining they didnt want duncan to become dependent on one person "things went bad really fast " says ms mitchell within a week she started getting calls about duncans behavior and was often summoned to pick him up from school since november duncan has been attending a small private school with roughly children on a recent day he could name two children in a group a girl with long brown hair and boy with a shaggy haircut he said he couldnt remember the other childrens names while researchers are looking to study prosopagnosia in children other efforts are being made to understand how children with autism process faces since they often struggle with face recognition and emotional expression psychologists jim tanaka of the university of victoria and robert schultz of yale child study center are wrapping up a five year national institutes of health study of a computer game they created for children with autism to try to improve their face recognition skills dr tanaka says hes eager to see if the game can help prosopagnosic children after initial face recognition tests autistic children ages to played games on a computer program called "lets face it" for hours half participated in the game and half didnt the ones who did saw improvement the researcher likened the experiment to giving patients a drug in a clinical trial "i wont say its a slam dunk but were getting good results " says dr tanaka the key he says is early intervention "the earlier the better because of what we know about the plasticity of the brain " ms mitchell says shes open to allowing duncan to participate in research and the family plans to send duncan to a one day "face camp" that dr tanaka is sponsoring for children see related letter "letters
