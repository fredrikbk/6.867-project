friends of hillary shes seeking women executives to aid her climb to the top its harder than youd think washington d c shes the ultimate professional woman so youd think hillary clintons biggest source of support would be other alpha females but as the new york senators presidential campaign works to mobilize women executives doctors and lawyers around america its getting a reality check many have resisted the call up so far shes doing better among women of more modest means professional women are "much harder sells" than men says a clinton campaign adviser "theyre tough " they are less inclined than men to see things in black and white and seek more information before deciding this adviser says events for businesswomen must be substantive because they frequently ask more questions than businessmen sen clintons advisers say at one such clinton event former tennis star billie jean king and other supporters tried to pump up the crowd as if it were a political rally the feedback from attendees says senior campaign adviser ann lewis was "less rah rah more substance " dr janice werbinski past president of american medical womens association and an early clinton supporter says she didnt like the new york senators answers in a recent conference call for female physicians "now im having second thoughts " she says "i saw the same thing when i ran for senate the first time in " sen clinton said in an interview on wednesday afternoon "professional women were the last to close for me " they were not about to support her just because of her gender she said "this is very much in line with what ive seen" in past campaigns among all women democrats republicans and independents feelings toward sen clinton vary with professional status according to the latest wall street journal nbc national poll taken in early november among nonprofessionals said they had positive impressions of her while were negative but women who identify themselves as professionals or managers were markedly less enthusiastic with reporting positive impressions and negative another challenge professional women are naturally higher income than their nonprofessional peers putting them squarely in the traditional low tax antiregulation territory of the republican party meg whitman chief executive of ebay inc has held fund raisers for republican candidate mitt romney carly fiorina former chief executive of hewlett packard co supports republican sen john mccain kerrii anderson ceo of wendys international inc supports former new york mayor rudy giuliani overall sen clinton is doing well with democratic women said they support sen clinton according to the wall street journal nbc poll sen barack obama ran second among democratic candidates with sen clinton has made inroads with women executives and has bagged some trophy supporters among them google inc managers on the west coast and ernst &amp young executives on the east coast minneapolis entrepreneurs and miami real estate brokers ms king and fashion designer diane von furstenberg sen obama however has the backing of one of the most popular female moguls oprah winfrey whos campaigning for him businesswomen share many motives with their male counterparts for supporting presidential candidates they back candidates whose positions they believe will benefit their businesses in order to get access to the white house in hopes of snaring a job in the administration or just to be on personal terms with a president perhaps because they havent been playing the political game as long as their male colleagues they are sometimes less willing to go public with their support some are reluctant to speak out for fear of upsetting clients or customers who may disagree with their politics "im not broadcasting my support for hillary " says diane miramontes the only female principal at her commercial real estate brokerage in san diego "in venues of high net worth individuals typically republicans ive learned to keep my mouth shut " she is however distributing clinton materials to younger women in her office and speaks favorably of the candidate if asked anne mulcahy chief executive of xerox corp has told some people shes supporting sen clinton but she has not said so publicly this summer terry mcauliffe sen clintons campaign chairman visited ellyn mccolgan then a rising star at fidelity investments in boston she agreed to support sen clinton but left the mutual fund company two months later to the campaigns disappointment one theory about sen clintons weaker numbers among professional women is that more affluent women arent as worried about health care child care the minimum wage and other issues important to nonprofessionals but in the wall street journal nbc poll professional women gave her lower ratings than did nonprofessional women in such categories as "being honest and straightforward " "being compassionate enough to understand average people " "having high personal standards that set the proper moral tone for the country " and "being easygoing and likable " both groups gave her high marks for being "knowledgeable and experienced enough to handle the presidency " "women who work on their feet nurses teachers strongly prefer hillary " says geraldine laybourne founder and former chief executive officer of oxygen media llc now a unit of nbc universal whos helping the clinton campaign the goal she says is to "make visible that women in business support hillary" in order to build that base the campaign is in recruiting overdrive already women account for of sen clintons "bundlers" the top fund raisers who pull in donations from others the campaign is counting on them to dig deep into their blackberrys and rolodexes to do the kind of networking practiced years ago by the friends of bill during mr clintons initial run for the white house that group of loyalists used its clout to broaden support for him "were tapping into networks that professional and business women have developed over years " says ms lewis the senior campaign adviser who uses media lists of the nations "most powerful women" to prospect for supporters the strategy was on display one evening last month on manhattans upper east side nearly businesswomen gathered at a townhouse to hear citigroup inc executive lisa caputo talk about her longtime friendship with sen clinton when it was over the businesswomen left behind checks totaling tens of thousand of dollars a couple of them penciled into their calendars weekend trips to iowa to canvass caucus goers many left with hillary buttons pinned to their suits "theres a sisterhood solidarity going on here " says ms caputo who served as press secretary for sen clinton when she was first lady many of the executives supporting sen clinton said in interviews that they werent doing so because she is a woman but because they consider her the best candidate for the job critics of sen clinton say she is trying to have it both ways to play down her gender with some audiences and to play it up with others "this is such a strange argument to make " sen clinton said "when i talk with women i talk about what its like to be a mom and daughter if i talk to the armed services i talk about how i would be as a commander in chief " different circumstances she said require different approaches "moms who work in business dont act the same with their kids or at the office " the clinton campaign is working to build an infrastructure to organize and expand support among businesswomen the campaign says thousands of business and professional women have signed up to receive a weekly "hillgram" email summarizing events and offering suggestions on how to help along with an inspirational quote each week from a cramped two room office suite at clinton campaign headquarters in arlington va ms lewis and two colleagues capricia marshall and dana singiser search for names of possible supporters in professional journals and business publications in breast cancer awareness groups and working mom blogs when the campaign locates supporters it offers to help them organize debate parties policy breakfasts conference calls and larger gatherings with sen clinton on the road sen clinton carries "call sheets" with the names and numbers of high profile women she wants to woo or thank in many cities she has private meetings with local businesswomen and professionals the campaign dispatches a female "surrogate" for the candidate to some events the list includes ms caputo former secretary of state madeleine albright and laura

hanson chairman of milestone capital management an investment management firm in february after the two women met ms white phoned ms hanson to offer a personal appearance by president clinton "can you
