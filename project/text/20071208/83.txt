weekend journal leisure &amp arts sightings america for arabs in translation which of our books and plays would tell them the most about us the stage manager who narrates wilders play about life in an imaginary new hampshire village remarks at one point that a copy of the script will be placed in a time capsule in the cornerstone of a new bank so that future generations will have a record of the way we were in our growing up and in our marrying and in our living and in our dying gillian gibbons a british schoolteacher working in sudan was recently thrown in jail and later deported for the crime of insulting islam by allowing her year old charges to name a teddy bear mohammed meanwhile a united arab emirates based project called kalima "word" in arabic has announced plans to translate hundreds of foreign books into arabic and distribute them throughout the middle east the venture which has official government backing was inspired by a united nations report that pointed out that more books are translated into spanish each year than were translated into arabic in the past years "the rest of the world enjoys a wealth of domestic and translated writing " founder karim nagy told a reporter for the guardian "why should the arab world be any different " i dare say that ms gibbons could help answer that question you can see a list of kalimas first titles at the projects web site www kalima ae it is like most such lists a mix of the brilliantly appropriate eric hoffers "the true believer thoughts on the nature of mass movements" and the inexplicably quirky astrid lindgrens "pippi longstocking" for the most part i found it impressive though i couldnt help but wonder what conclusions arabs might draw about us after consulting a bookshelf containing the works of among others aristophanes dante montaigne galileo george eliot john maynard keynes francois truffaut jacques derrida umberto eco stephen hawking and peter drucker i also asked myself a related question what books would i send to an arab or any other foreigner who wanted to know what america and its people are like kalimas list of books is multicultural by design since its purpose is to give arabs access to the widest possible range of information about the world beyond their borders but id venture to guess that the average arab reader is especially ill informed when it comes to the everyday realities of life in this country and it strikes me that it would be of great value to the rest of the world if a well chosen shelf of books about america were to be put into the hands of a large number of arabs which is needless to say a very big if which works would i pick some like "the federalist " mark twains "adventures of huckleberry finn" and alexis de tocquevilles "democracy in america " are so obvious that they scarcely require mentioning though none of these three titles as it happens is currently scheduled for distribution by kalima but where might you go from there i drew up a short list of candidates prior to looking at kalimas web site and was pleased to see that one of my authors isaac bashevis singer also made their list i chose "enemies a love story " while kalima opted for "collected stories " here are my other choices willa cather "o pioneers " not only has there never been a more evocative portrayal of the american pioneer existence but "o pioneers " is by and about a strong independent minded woman something that i suspect many arabs of both sexes would find edifying james m mcpherson "battle cry of freedom the civil war era " this pulitzer winning one volume chronicle of the american civil war is an excitingly written account of the pivotal moment in our post revolutionary history what could be more inspiring to modern day middle easterners than a book about a western nation that fought and survived a bloody war to reunite itself thornton wilder "our town " the stage manager who narrates wilders play about life in an imaginary new hampshire village remarks at one point that a copy of the script will be placed in a time capsule in the cornerstone of a new bank so that future generations will have a record of "the way we were in our growing up and in our marrying and in our living and in our dying " "our town" says more about these humble things than any other work of american literary art f scott fitzgerald "the great gatsby " and richard wright "black boy " no portrait of america in all its proliferating complexity can claim to be complete without showing our people at their ugliest these two books do that albeit in very different ways fitzgeralds richly lyrical novella focuses on the dark side of the american national character wrights scalding memoir on the savagery of racism edwin oconnor "the last hurrah " how does politics really work in a democracy this novel about a big city mayoral election is a rousing piece of old fashioned storytelling that also gives its readers an up close look at the american political process two additional novels that cover other pieces of the same turf robert penn warrens "all the kings men" and allen drurys "advise and consent " are no less valuable to foreigners seeking to understand how america rules and misrules itself in the long run i doubt that we could do more to help shape middle eastern perceptions about america for the better than by translating these books into arabic
