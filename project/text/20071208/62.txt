the week ahead our take on coming events politics miami immigration debate puts heat on republicans by susan davis with less than four weeks to go before the first presidential contests republicans face a precarious test on immigration sunday for months the candidates have largely been trying to outdo each other on who would take a harder line cracking down on illegals this weekend theyll be asked to elaborate in a debate hosted by spanish language network univision at the university of miami "look this is going to be a painful experience for the republican party to stand up to a hispanic audience and explain themselves on immigration " said frank sherry executive director of the pro immigration national immigration forum "the jujitsu is going to be fascinating to watch " "most importantly well be watching for consistency " said dan stein president of the anti immigration federation for american immigration reform it is the first republican debate before a predominantly minority audience and the candidates will be in the hot seat before one of the most scrutinizing audiences on the topic it comes as new surveys show republicans rapidly losing support among the growing hispanic population voters president bush and his chief strategist karl rove saw as an essential element of the st century republican coalition seven of the eight contenders will participate in sundays forum immigration foe rep tom tancredo r colo said he wouldnt join a debate not conducted in english the candidates will be speaking english but the event will be broadcast through simultaneous translation in spanish most of those appearing are doing so reluctantly the original debate was slated for september but was canceled after sen john mccain r ariz was the only major candidate who agreed to participate others cited scheduling conflicts meanwhile democratic candidates participated in a univision debate in september that was watched by million viewers among the leading republicans former new york mayor rudy giuliani and mr mccain share more moderate views on the creation of a path to citizenship for the estimated million undocumented workers in the country former tennessee sen fred thompson and former massachusetts gov mitt romney advocate a tougher approach and oppose any "amnesty" proposals mike huckabee the fields fast rising dark horse has been attacked by rivals for taking a tolerant attitude toward illegal immigration during his time as arkansas governor on friday he decided to unveil a nine point plan that includes one of the toughest proposals yet mr huckabee would require all illegal immigrants to register with the federal government and leave the country within days before applying to return the candidates will be walking a fine line between appealing to the partys conservative base while not further alienating the fastest growing minority group in the country that is increasingly trending democratic in the three early states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina immigration ranks as a greater issue of concern for republican voters than democrats according to a pew research center poll released last week likely republican iowa caucus goers cited immigration as their no concern over terrorism on the other hand the pew hispanic center released new data thursday that showed of registered hispanic voters now align themselves with the democratic party only identified with the republicans the point gap in party affiliation is up from the point gap reported in july china promise of trade talks with u s uncertain by jason leow next weeks round of the u s china strategic economic dialogue will mark a turning point in one sense treasury secretary hank paulson will bid adieu to his counterpart chinese vice premier wu yi who is soon to retire whether this third round of sed and a separate set of bilateral trade talks earlier in the week will yield any other meaningful changes is unclear the two day meeting which starts wednesday outside beijing is likely to focus both on longstanding issues of dispute most notably american criticism that chinas currency policy is causing its massive destabilizing trade surplus with the u s and on the relatively new but equally intense rancor over safety problems with chinese exports the u s delegation will also include commerce secretary carlos gutierrez and four other cabinet level u s officials besides mr paulson the talks take place at a time when political ties have frayed over congress honoring of the dalai lama the tibetan spiritual leader beijing labels a separatist and over chinas recent refusal to allow u s navy ships to make thanksgiving holiday port calls in hong kong meanwhile china has increasingly been a target of candidates on the u s presidential campaign trail given the safety problems that have surfaced this year with chinese pet food toys and other goods the issue is likely to be prominent u s health and human services secretary mike leavitt who will also be in china has said he expects to sign two agreements with chinese officials to ensure food and drug imports from china are safe financial issues like the currency debate might not make much headway a chinese official on friday played down those expectations saying the sed is a platform for clarifying expectations but "not for negotiations " whatever happens ms wus imminent departure casts doubt over the long term future of the talks while she doesnt single handedly control chinas trade policy she has been mr paulsons dance partner at the sed since its first round a year ago the year old vice premier long chinas most senior female official is a tough negotiator who has nevertheless earned the admiration of her counterparts as a reasonable interlocutor who can get things done mr paulson once called her a "force of nature " and this week in a speech to the asia society called her "an extraordinary representative of her country " ms wu for her part is a staunch advocate of chinas internationalization "the chinese and american economies are interwoven interdependent and inseparable " she said in a speech last month to an american chamber of commerce in china dinner "chinas door will remain open forever " who will replace ms wu isnt clear but the most likely candidate appears to be zhang dejiang who could bring a different approach to the table the current party secretary of guangdong the booming southern province mr zhang holds a degree in economics from north koreas kim il sung university he has little experience dealing with diplomacy or foreign trade with mr zhang says song guoqing a professor at peking universitys china center for economic research "the policy wont change but the execution might "
