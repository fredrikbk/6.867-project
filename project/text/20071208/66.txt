weekend journal books sir arthur conundrum doyle from baker street to half baked ideas a writer who detected fairies and ghosts the man who created sherlock holmes by andrew lycett free press pages &# arthur conan doyle a life in letters edited by jon lellenberg daniel stashower and charles foley penguin pages &# fans of sherlock holmes have never known what to make of his creators irrational superstitions "this agency stands flat footed upon the ground " the violin playing detective assured his friend dr john watson in "the adventure of the sussex vampire " adding "no ghosts need apply " yet at the time arthur conan doyle wrote these lines in the early s he was perhaps the best known defender of spiritualism "the st paul of the new revelation " as some called him to his delight who traveled the globe spreading the message that the spirits of the dead surround us "is conan doyle mad " one contemporary paper asked how could the creator of "the worlds first consulting detective" fall for such a cheap trick as photographing ghosts and fairies a common explanation has been that the poor man was simply distraught from losing his eldest son kingsley to flu during world war i in fact however conan doyle began his spiritualist crusade before kingsley fell ill and had been interested in psychic phenomena even before the debut of holmes as a young doctor conan doyle experimented with telepathy attended seances and once tagged along on a sort of "ghostbusting" mission his group determined that the mysterious sounds in the house they visited were probably made by the familys mischievous son and he filled his early stories with the uncanny "what is science " he wrote in "the mystery of cloomber " an novella about an eastern curse "science is the consensus of opinion of scientific men and history has shown that it is slow to accept a truth " andrew lycett sees in such passages a foreshadowing of the arguments that conan doyle would make when he became a public exponent of spiritualism years later mr lycetts "the man who created sherlock holmes" joins other books that have lately shed new light on neglected aspects of the authors development as it happens daniel stashower who brought out his own lively conan doyle biography in has just edited along with jon lellenberg and charles foley a generous selection of previously unpublished letters by conan doyle the two books would be best read together the british mr lycett delves deeply into the intellectual and literary milieu of conan doyles youth finding the wellsprings of both his literature and his later spiritualism in the late th century mr lycett notes an interest in the paranormal was hardly incompatible with the spirit of scientific inquiry the experimental curiosity that led conan doyle as a young medical student to dose himself with strange drugs to test their effects also led him to investigate the supernatural conan doyles letters meanwhile capture as no biography can certain qualities of the mans personality his loyalty his bluff optimism and his surprising sense of humor we are even treated to a sketch the newly minted doctor drew of himself upon passing his exams at edinburgh university skipping happily and waving a diploma labeled "licensed to kill " but the letters are likely to be of little enjoyment to anyone who isnt already familiar with conan doyles life most of them are addressed to his mother mary this tells you something about the man but it also means a lot of tedious family business and travel logistics the letters also tend to skirt subjects that conan doyle felt uncomfortable addressing with "the mam " his interest in the paranormal was among them so was his relationship with his father mary had with arthurs cooperation placed his alcoholic father charles in an institution where he spent the last years of his life around the same time she developed a close relationship seemingly not romantic with a boarder in her house a man much resented by arthur conan doyle is more forthcoming in his letters about the two romantic relationships in his life as a young doctor in edinburgh he married the sister of a patient louise "touie" conan doyle bore him two children but developed tuberculosis in the early s just as her husband was tasting fame with his holmes stories as his invalid wife moved from sanitorium to sanitorium conan doyle fell in love with a much younger woman jean leckie she was when she met the year old author in it was a relationship that for a decade appears to have remained secret passionate and unconsummated finally touie died in and arthur and jean were lawfully wed the following year conan doyle had kept this relationship secret from his ailing wife but not from his mother his loving letters about both jean and touie are often exculpatory and occasionally defensive but they do convey his highly developed sense of honor by documenting his struggle to be faithful in different ways to these two women and the letters compel a certain admiration for the man who stayed true to his ideal of marital fidelity reading conan doyles letters you often find cause to admire him even when you find his ideas mad or his prejudices gross he was susceptible to the casual racism of the time and he regarded suffragists as violent and dangerous if not necessarily wrong he seemed driven to put the fame won by his detective stories in the service of some larger cause conan doyle argued publicly in favor of the boer war against the belgians in the congo in favor of preparedness and voluntarism during world war i more than once he campaigned in the newspapers on behalf of the unjustly imprisoned spiritualism was simply the last and greatest of his crusades "it is the thing " he wrote "for which every preceding phase have each and all been an unconscious preparation " it was the work for which conan doyle wished to be remembered he saw spiritualism not as some eccentric enthusiasm but as a new scientifically provable religion that would revitalize or replace the old outmoded spiritual practices of established churches but of course we remember him as in mr lycetts phrase the man who created sherlock holmes to the end of his days he received letters and gifts addressed to the fictional detective and he is often said to have chafed at this identification "he keeps me from higher things " conan doyle complained to his mother shortly before he heaved the detective and his nemesis moriarty over reichenbach falls in "killed holmes " he wrote pithily once the deed was done by the evidence of the letters though such authorial pique was usually a passing mood conan doyle willingly returned to baker street in later years initially bringing holmes back from the dead in exchange for a large paycheck from an american publisher and churning out adventures up through the s a good portion of the holmes canon was written after the detectives supposed demise though conan doyles revival of the character in "the hound of the baskervilles" was set before the fateful plunge and conan doyle apparently came to regard holmes as an old and remunerative friend did holmes in fact prevent conan doyle from reaching for "higher things" we must keep in mind that the authors estimation of his literary accomplishments would not accord with our own sense of them he hoped to be regarded by posterity as a master of historical romance an heir to walter scott his novels "micah clarke " "the white company" and "rodney stone" are the titles he wanted to last they havent and for a simple reason they were among the last works in their chosen genre while the holmes tales are some of the first of theirs and the best despite the veneer of holmess "scientific" method the detective stories reveal a deeply romantic strain in conan doyles work indeed they carry his chivalric ideals into a new era and place them at the center of the mystery form what is the camaraderie of holmes and watson for instance but a victorian version of dumass musketeer ethos holmes constantly criticizes watson for romanticizing his accounts of their cases and the doctor describing a conversation with two of holmess clients rather gives the game away in "the sign of four" "it is a romance cried mrs forrester an injured lady half a million in treasure a black cannibal and a wooden legged ruffian they take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl "and two knight errants to the rescue " added miss morstan with a bright glance at me " we may remember arthur conan doyle for his shrewdly reasoned detective stories or his eccentric beliefs but in this case his portrait of holmes may reflect how sir arthur thought of himself a knight errant in a dull age mr propson is a deputy editor at the week
