how much is a fund really worth in late august when the giant money market mutual fund columbia cash reserves listed its investments for shareholders it valued its holdings of cheyne finance llc debt at about &# million in late november it valued that same debt at the same price the only problem in october cheyne had defaulted on its interest payments to investors it may look as if the fund still had a rock solid investment in cheyne but behind the scenes columbia funds marked down the price on its cheyne securities it is perfectly acceptable for funds to do this the rules governing money market mutual funds dont require funds to tell shareholders how much their investments are really worth in recent months a number of money market funds have struggled with investments in complex securities like cheyne that are backed in part by low quality mortgages just this past week moodys investors service and standard &amp poors warned that it may downgrade ratings on such securities held by at least a dozen money funds downgrades are dangerous because they can result in price declines that could put a money fund at risk of losing money but due to the rules dictating how money market funds operate it can be tough to figure out if a portfolio manager has made losing bets the requirement is that they declare a value that is based on the purchase price in quieter times this isnt an issue regulations put extremely tight controls on the kinds of securities money funds are permitted to own limiting holdings to short term debt that are unlikely to experience big swings in price "the theory is that not as much disclosure is needed when you have greater regulation " says barry barbash a veteran fund industry lawyer and former securities and exchange commission official "that theory gets thrown into question from time to time " overall the emphasis is on whether the value of the funds portfolio as a whole is stable at &# per share the theory is that for a funds investors price movements of an individual security "dont make a difference as long as the overall portfolio is valued at a dollar " says deborah cunningham head of the taxable money market group at federated investors inc which runs more than four dozen money market funds but troubles have arisen in a number of money funds theyre holding short term debt issued by complicated entities called structured investment vehicles or sivs this siv debt is backed by other kinds of assets some of which are low quality mortgage securities that have gotten hammered by the collapse of the real estate market because of the real estate bust the value of those siv securities has declined significantly in some cases trading in the debt has nearly dried up making it extremely difficult to get a sense of what its worth on the open market the most basic way of establishing the value of something while regulators and boards of directors overseeing money funds are kept up to speed on the actual prices of portfolio holdings investors are allowed to be kept in the dark the value that funds like columbia cash reserves are required to publish is the so called amortized cost which is essentially a value assigned to the security based on its purchase price officials at columbia funds a unit of bank of america corp declined to discuss valuations of specific securities that isnt to say the real prices of money fund holdings dont matter under certain investment rules money funds must compare the market value of the portfolio to the worth of the portfolio based on the amortized cost if the difference is more than the rules mandate the funds board of directors meet to determine if the fund needs to take any action to address the cause of the deviation first american funds in the firms most recent annual report provided a small window into how this process works several securities in its prime obligations fund cheyne finance kkr atlantic funding trust and kkr pacific funding trust ran into trouble according to that report conditions in the market for these securities which comprised about of the portfolio had deteriorated to the point where the fund had to estimate their prices the report said but when the value of all the funds holdings was added up the difference with the amortized value was less than that meant the firm said that management continued "to value prime obligation fund at amortized cost " in other words it was still worth &# a share adding to the difficulty of assessing your money market funds investment skills some fund companies are bailing their funds out of trouble by purchasing the troubled securities from the funds or else they are providing back up financial support should the share price start to look like it might be in danger of falling below &# that means those securities essentially disappear from portfolio holdings without a trace thats good news for investors of course it means fund companies are protecting investors from troubled holdings however disclosure of moves like these has been uneven among fund companies making it tough for investors to judge which funds have run up on the rocks a few funds such as at first american have disclosed the removal of specific securities from the fund in the case of first american it was debt issued by funds including ottimo funding a distressed siv others have told investors little the &# billion credit suisse institutional money market fund held billions of dollars in siv issued notes and commercial paper at the end of june by october none of those securities were listed credit suisse asset management hasnt provided a written explanation of how it disposed of the securities a spokeswoman declined to comment columbia funds meanwhile hasnt told its investors which securities it holds are distressed or specified the amount of financial support that bank of america has pledged to the funds "affected funds will not be specifically named consistent with disclosure policies and procedures " the firm said in a note to investors the firm declined to provide additional comment
