oil man and rancher who created atlantic richfield co at one time the nations seventh largest oil company he was best known for arcos discovery of the giant prudhoe bay oilfield in alaska the largest field ever discovered in north america but prudhoe was only one of a series of wildcat plays mr anderson backed including large fields in oklahoma and new mexico despite his huge white hat and giant ranches that made him one of the top landowners on the continent mr anderson was far from a stereotypical outdoorsman for years he was president and then chairman of the aspen institute where the worlds great and good gather to discuss weighty subjects he had a habit of stepping in to save flagging publications including the observer of london and harpers magazine the atlantic richfield foundation joined with the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation in to create the harpers magazine foundation which continues to own the publication today mr anderson who died dec at his home in roswell n m at age was a well heeled autodidact the terms of the scholarship he won at the university of chicago allowed him to study anything he wanted without attending class he studied classical philosophy after graduation mr anderson went into the oil business inspired in part by the tales of wildcatters he heard from his father a vice president at the first national bank of chicago who helped found the practice of lending money to drillers using oil in the ground as collateral hugo a andersons banking perspicacity was twice recognized through knighthoods bestowed by the king of sweden in mr anderson used &# in borrowed money to buy a stake in a new mexican refining company where he learned the oil business just as world war ii was giving demand a kick he helped upgrade a refinery to produce aviation fuel for army air corps planes at the roswell air base laid a pipeline to an oilfield and began wildcatting for crude his company was awarded the contract to supply diesel fuel to the manhattan project in los alamos miles away through his hondo oil co named for the river than ran by his ranch he drilled wildcat wells culminating in with the quarter billion barrel empire abo oilfield in southeast new mexico and he started buying up oil discovery and refining companies being a budding empire builder in the oil business wasnt enough by he had bought up ranching interests encompassing nearly acres of new mexico grazing land supporting cattle and horses according to west texas livestock weekly there was a feedlot as well as a steel products company that fabricated pipelines he had seven children with barbara his wife of years and was says son phelps anderson "always there for us " in partly over concerns about inheritance taxes mr anderson traded his company to the atlantic refining co of philadelphia for stock valued at &# million making him the companys largest stockholder he told the wall street journal that he was astonished to find the company in shambles due to " years of isolation in philadelphia " two years later when he was elected atlantics chairman and chief executive he told a news conference "the likelihood of a merger in the near future is remote " as often in mr andersons career the improbable occurred atlantic was a major refiner of heating oil and a big gasoline retailer but mostly relied on others for its crude oil it was vulnerable to price wars in the east coast markets it supplied "it had to grow though acquisitions and mergers " mr anderson told the journal in the richfield oil corp which marketed gas on the west coast had significant crude holdings it had acquired leases to some wildcat properties in alaskas north slope atlantic had bid on those properties and lost out to richfield says edward m benson jr at the time a drilling executive for richfield in during a fishing retreat with richfields chief mr anderson sealed a merger deal shortly after atlantic richfield co or arco was created messrs anderson and benson flew to the north slope for a look around the company rented a giant lockheed c transport to ferry rigs to the site making about flights within a month before the plane went into service as an air force transport in vietnam after a first hole turned out dry much of the companys board favored abandoning the project recalls mr benson later arcos vice chairman he says he persuaded them to persevere because flying the equipment home was nearly as expensive as drilling a second well asked why mr anderson stayed on board mr benson says "he had a belly for risk and a real feel for exploration " in january arco announced a major new field that became known as prudhoe bay walter j hickel then alaska governor and later secretary of the interior under president nixon credits mr anderson for being the only oil man willing to drill in the remote area under the restrictive leases upon which the state insisted "i told him drill or i will " recalls mr hickel now "we never would have had a prudhoe bay without him " arco retuned its west coast refineries for alaskan crude but delays frustrated mr anderson "if only the alaska pipeline had been completed on schedule the arab oil embargo of would have ended up a very different story " he told forbes in in the company moved its headquarters to los angeles from new york arcos new headquarters included a street level art museum a typical anderson touch the company gave the los angeles county art museum &# million and it named its main building for mr anderson he also helped design arcos distinctive logo the "spark " and its typeface despite his attention to detail he came to the office sporadically commuting via corporate jet from his roswell ranch his landholdings ballooned for a time to over a million acres a second big merger with sinclair oil corp in helped increase arcos geographic penetration and refining capacity arco was sometimes called the "eighth sister " for being the biggest petroleum company without standard oil roots thanks in large part to prudhoe bay arcos sales went from &# billion in to nearly &# billion in but mr andersons later acquisitions mostly failed his merger with anaconda co the countrys third largest domestic copper producer ended up in messy lawsuits over pollution he was prescient about global warming about which he warned in the new york times in but his acquisition of a solar cell company did nothing to make that technology profitable mr anderson became known in some circles as the conscience of the oil industry for backing conservation measures he was a lifetime republican and an adviser to presidents nixon and reagan he first declared he would retire in but stayed at the helm of arco until when he retired during a corporate restructuring spurred by low gas prices declaring that "a rocking chair and television screen are a quick way to the graveyard " he resuscitated his hondo oil &amp gas co in and embarked on a series of investments including a california refinery he bought during a gas price slump and a wildcatting venture in colombia they didnt pan out "his belly didnt work for him " says mr benson mr anderson sold swaths of real estate and was restored to financial health by the late s he sometimes invited groups of or more to his new mexico ranch for camping and hunting trips on horseback still a big shareholder in arco he made a rare appearance at a company meeting in in support of a merger with bp amoco now called bp plc he had forgotten his stetson but the shareholders gave him a standing ovation and over of them voted in favor of the merger
