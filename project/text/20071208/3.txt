as small food firm takes top role supplying troops questions arise hawthorne calif the second largest supplier of food for u s troops in iraq is a company that didnt even exist until a few months after the american invasion yet ocean direct llc located in a modest single story building near los angeles international airport today occupies a vital link in a lucrative trade how did an obscure outfit without significant food processing facilities or experience in the business achieve such success the answer may lie in its origins until now a secret in the government food service industry ocean direct is majority owned by an older food company that is already a big player in the military food business a lawyer for the parent firm confirmed ocean directs parent company richmond wholesale meats inc says it created ocean direct for legitimate business reasons but the opaque structure causes concern among some former federal investigators who say the hidden ownership is the kind of arrangement that government investigators are increasingly focused on in contracting work in iraq the u s government spends tens of billions of dollars a year supporting the plus u s troops in iraq and the way that money gets spent has come under increasing scrutiny a key area of interest is the military food chain the former investigators question whether food contracts are being won properly they say government suppliers can conceal their true market share one of the measures the government takes into account in awarding contracts companies could do that by dividing business among seemingly unrelated entities lessening suspicion about possible price fixing or antitrust issues a far reaching criminal inquiry by military and justice department investigators has been focusing on whether a kuwaiti company public warehousing corp colluded with an affiliated kuwaiti supplier to overcharge the government and divvy up the proceeds a kuwaiti merchant family the sultans are major stockholders in both firms investigators also are examining more broadly whether public warehousing is choosing its suppliers fairly ocean direct is one of public warehousings top american suppliers overall ocean direct billed the u s government for about &# million worth of seafood and canned goods shipped world wide between mid and mid industry sales figures show that ranks the four year old upstart second only to food powerhouse pepsico inc among military food suppliers and ahead of such well known giants as tyson foods inc kraft foods inc and archer daniels midland in supplying food for troops world wide feeding troops around the globe is a mammoth undertaking for the government especially in a time of war the defense department spends about &# billion a year on food with at least &# billion of that going to the middle east much of the food that goes to troops in iraq must under law originate with u s firms creating a supply chain stretching from the west coast to kuwait and into iraq after inquiries ocean direct confirmed that it is a marketing arm of richmond wholesale meats one of the companies already under federal scrutiny according to people familiar with the probe richmond said it set up ocean direct in october one of the brands under the ocean direct umbrella is american bounty which supplies baked goods together richmond ocean direct and american bounty sold the military more than &# million in food supplies between mid and mid the use of multiple names by a single contractor could attract interest from fraud investigators experts say the government tends to raise its antennae when a "prime vendor" such as public warehousing obtains a big portion of its products from one company seeing that as one warning sign for overcharging or other forms of fraud investigators will want to know whether the multiple names represent an "effort to conceal corporate relationships as part of a broader scheme to conceal inflated charges " says david laufman a former top justice department official who now advises companies involved in contracting probes as a partner at the law firm kelley drye &amp warren llp the justice department and the pentagon declined to comment citing the criminal inquiry richmond says it operates this way for legitimate marketing reasons ocean directs "standing as a separate company has enhanced its ability to achieve product differentiation " richmond said in a statement "the affiliation between richmond and ocean direct is a common structure in the food service industry as well as in the government contracting industry " the use of affiliates and different trading names is common in business but in government contracting it is rarer because of disclosure requirements aimed at ensuring the government has a good picture of the relationships between its suppliers robert baumann a former defense department contracting fraud investigator said he often encountered contractors using multiple names "in almost every instance where the controlling interest was hidden the government took it in the shorts " he said ocean direct says on its web site that it "manufactures a full line of quality fin fish shellfish and breaded fish alternatives " and it rents its own booth at the militarys annual food fair however much of ocean directs product lineup is supplied by traditional seafood producers according to interviews with those firms the company operates out of a small warehouse in a gritty industrial zone in hawthorne calif near los angeles international airport it is filled with machinery for packaging and labeling food that originates elsewhere while it is common for so called consolidators to buy up merchandise to resell to the government it is unusual for them to represent themselves as manufacturers doing so could help a company avoid the question of what value it is adding by relabeling another companys product richmond confirmed that it often contracts with seafood producers to make products sold by ocean direct the system allows richmond "to achieve the highest levels of efficiencies and significant cost savings " the company said "it is also well known to customers including our government customer and its auditors " both ocean direct and richmond sell their food to public warehousing the kuwaiti firm that holds the main food contract for iraq former senior employees of public warehousing say the company never told the pentagon that ocean direct american bounty and richmond had common ownership asked about this public warehousing said the three suppliers "were clearly identified" in its contract proposals the company added that "the government reviewed and approved the prices charged by each of its suppliers for all goods " contractors and subcontractors generally are obligated to disclose to the government whether they are related by ownership to other firms involved in fulfilling a particular contract procurement law experts say "to make sure there isnt anything nefarious going on they have to provide a complete disclosure on their ownership during the acquisition process and that would include the subcontractors " said mr baumann the former defense department investigator the precise requirements public warehousing faced in this case arent clear as previously reported the justice department investigation is focused on a separate instance of undisclosed common ownership this time between public warehousing and another of its major suppliers the sultan center food co of kuwait public warehousing says the government was aware that members of the sultan family were major stockholders in both the sultan center and public warehousing and therefore didnt need to be specifically told but prosecutors are seeking to determine whether the close ties between the two firms led to more than &# million in fraudulent overcharges many of ocean directs prices for supplies to iraq are about to higher than wholesale market prices pricing data show in june ocean direct supplied raw coldwater lobster tails to the government for about &# a pound while the average price for the same product on the wholesale market at that time was between &# and &# a pound said independent analyst john sackton who runs a market data web site called seafood com ocean direct is the sole supplier of lobster tail to u s forces in kuwait and iraq army data from state that the troops consume some cases of lobster tail per month at pounds per case ringing up a monthly bill from public warehousing to the u s government of at least &# million richmond wholesale founded in has about employees its own prices have been controversial within the industry pricing data show that public warehousing was buying beef brisket from richmond in for &# a pound when food industry professionals say it was available in the wholesale market for under &# a pound richmond said comparisons dont take into account the need to meet military and other government specifications or wholesale market conditions it called its prices "extremely competitive "
