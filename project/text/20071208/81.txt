weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations mormon in america did mitt romney have to give a speech on religion yes when youre in a race so close you could lose due to one issue your mormonism you must address the issue of your mormonism the only question was timing now in the primaries or later as the nominee but could he get to the general without the speech apparently he judged not mr romneys campaign must have some interesting internal polling about republicans on the ground in places like iowa and elsewhere but mr romney had other needs too his candidacy needed a high minded kick start it needed an act ii hes been around for a year hes made his first impression he needed to make it new again he seized the opportunity to connect his candidacy to something larger and transcendent the history of religious freedom in america he made a virtue of necessity he had nothing to prove to me regarding his faith or his church which apparently makes me your basic catholic catholics are not his problem his problem a romney aide told me had more to do with a particular fundamentalist strain within evangelical protestantism bill buckley once said hed rather be governed by the first thousand names in the boston phone book than the harvard faculty id rather be governed by donny and marie than the washington establishment mormons have been in american history hardworking family loving citizens whose civic impulses have tended toward the constructive good enough for me hes running for president not pastor in any case his faith is one thing about mr romney i havent questioned it is true that some in his campaign thought a speech risky but others saw it as an opportunity and a first draft was ready last march in certain ways mr romney had felt a tugging resistance ive been in public life served as governor run the olympics run a business i have to do a speech saying my faith wont distort my leadership in may he decided to do it but timing was everything his campaign wanted to do it when he was on the ascendancy not defensively but from a position of strength in october they decided to do the speech around thanksgiving mr romney gathered together all the material and began to work in earnest then they decided it would get lost in the holiday clutter they decided to go after thanksgiving but before dec the rise of mike huckabee according to this telling didnt force this decision but complicated it the campaign fixed on dec at the college station texas library of george h w bush with the former president introducing him which would lend a certain imprimatur and mute those who say his sons white house is pulling for rudy giuliani it is called his jfk speech but in many ways jfk had it easier than mr romney does now the catholic church was the single biggest christian denomination in america representing of the population mormons six million americans who had never met a catholic in had by fought side by side with them in world war ii and sat with them in college under the gi bill jfk had always signaled that he held his faith lightly not with furrow browed earnestness he had one great question to answer would he let the vatican control him as if and although some would vote against him because he was catholic some would vote for him for the same reason and they lived in the cities and suburbs of the industrial states mr romney gave the speech thursday morning how did he do very very well he made himself some history the words he said will likely have a real and positive impact on his fortunes the speechs main and immediate achievement is that foes of his faith will now have to defend their thinking in public but what can they say to counter his high minded arguments "mormons have cooties" romney reintroduced himself to a distracted country who is that handsome man saying those nice things while defending principles we all actually hold close and hold high his text was warmly cool it covered a lot of ground briskly in less than minutes his approach was calm logical with an emphasis on clarity it wasnt blowhardy and it wasnt fancy the only groaner was "we do not insist on a single strain of religion rather we welcome our nations symphony of faith " it is a great tragedy that there is no replacement for that signal phrase of the s "gag me with a spoon " beyond that the speech was marked by the simplicity that accompanies intellectual confidence at the start mr romney was nervous and rushed his voice less full than usual he settled down during the second applause halfway though the text "no candidate should become the spokesman for his faith for if he becomes president he will need the prayers of the people of all faiths " from that moment he was himself he started with a full jfk "i am an american running for president i do not define my candidacy by my religion a person should not be elected because of his faith nor should he be rejected because of his faith " no "authorities of my church" or any church will "ever exert influence" on presidential decisions "their authority is theirs " within the province of the church and it ends "where the affairs of the nation begin " "i will put no doctrine of any church above the plain duties of the office and the sovereign authority of the law " he pledged to serve "no one religion no one group no one cause and no one interest " he will not disavow his religion "my faith is the faith of my fathers i will be true to them and to my beliefs " bracingly "some believe that such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy if they are right so be it " whatever our faith the things we value equality obligation commitment to liberty unite us in a passage his advisers debated over until the night before the speech mr romney declared "i believe that jesus christ is the son of god and the savior of mankind " he made the call why i asked the aide "because its what he thinks " at the end he told a story he had inserted just before thanksgiving during the dark days of the first continental congress in philadelphia someone suggested the delegates pray but there were objections they all held different faiths "then sam adams rose and said he would hear a prayer from anyone of piety and good character as long as they were a patriot and so together they prayed " at this point in mr romneys speech the roused audience stood and applauded and the candidate looked moved there was one significant mistake in the speech i do not know why romney did not include nonbelievers in his moving portrait of the great american family we were founded by believing christians but soon enough jeremiah johnson and the old proud agnostic mountain men and the village atheist and the brahmin doubter were there and they too are part of us part of this wonderful thing we have why did mr romney not do the obvious thing and include them my guess it would have been reported and some idiots would have seen it and been offended that this romney character likes to laud atheists and he would have lost the idiot vote my feeling is weve bowed too far to the idiots this is true in politics journalism and just about everything else see related letters "letters to the editor mitt romney candidate patriot mormon" wsj dec
