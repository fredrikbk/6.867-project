weekend journal food &amp drink wine notes success with sparklers my wife and i understand that with natural corks defective wine should surface nearly of the time our "failure rate" is thankfully significantly less than that our question regards sparkling wine we drink a lot of sparklers and yet we have never to our knowledge encountered a corked bottle of sparkling wine why would that be edward robert mcgowan new orleans on the general issue we dont want to offer any specific percentage of wines that we believe are corked because wed be stuck with that number forever but the figures that are often thrown around such as are way too high the numbers are overstated for many reasons first it is in wineries interest to overstate the problem because then they can move to far less expensive closures such as screw caps while claiming they are doing it entirely for the benefit of consumers second wine geeks like to overstate the number because its a way of showing how very acute their senses are if one wine geek says he finds that of wines are corked another will smile patronizingly and say something like "you obviously dont have a high sensitivity to corked wines i find that are corked " its true that some people are far more sensitive to corkiness than others however many people who find a huge number of wines corked are confusing a corked bottle that is a bottle that has been ruined by a compound called tca that has contaminated its cork with all sorts of other flaws or are simply confusing bad wine with flawed wine and theres a lot of bad wine out there sometimes portions of wineries themselves are tainted with tca which raises the possibility that even if the bottles are closed with screw caps the wine will taste corked and thus smell like wet newspapers or cardboard all that said its also true that even a small percentage of wine ruined by bad corks is too much while research continues on the effect of alternate closures on fine wines that age for a long time theres little doubt that screw caps are just fine for the majority of wines which are meant to be drunk young and fresh many of the lively lovely sauvignon blancs from new zealand now are packaged with screw caps for instance and that makes perfect sense we still find that many readers equate screw caps with cheap wines but its time to get over that although screw caps arent perfect either of course and we like many of our readers do like real corks on the specific issue of why the mcgowans have not run across a corked bottle of bubbly we posed that question to george m taber author of the new book "to cork or not to cork tradition romance science and the battle for the wine bottle " his response "i think your readers may have just been lucky it may also be that the effervescence of the sparklers masks low levels of corkiness " mr taber added by the way that hed estimate the percentage of corked bottles at to melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com
