where should the burden of proof lie in requiring english at work rep george millers defense of the equal employment opportunity commissions actions against english only workplace rules letters dec correctly points out the use of such rules for the purpose of discrimination is and should be unlawful he inadvertently reveals the crux of the problem however when he states that "the eeoc has long held that an english only work rule violates the law unless the employer can provide a legitimate reason for it " thus once accused by the eeoc the employer must prove its innocence this presumption of guilt undermines the constitutional principles such as due process that mr miller has presumably sworn to uphold howard j klein irvine calif rep george millers letter to the editor raises an interesting question he says "however our government has a responsibility to protect citizens from workplace discrimination " citizenship has an english language requirement according to the u s citizenship and immigration services website "applicants for naturalization must be able to read write speak and understand words in ordinary usage in the english language " see http www uscis gov if the congressman intended to refer to people who are being extended the privilege of a work visa with extremely few exceptions they must be sponsored and given an offer of employment prior to receiving a visa presumably they would also meet any english language requirement the employer had in place is it possible that rep miller is trying to protect workers who have failed the requisite legal requirement of citizenship or have already agreed in advance to the conditions of their employment alan m then plano texas rep miller begins his polemic by calling the opinion of john fund misguided mr miller contends that requiring english only in the workplace is discrimination except "where it is necessary for employees to speak english and current law permits the use of english only policies in those circumstances " who decides where it is necessary for employees to speak english is it only for reasons of safety what about the millions of small businesses that lose customers because of the mistakes made by their employees that dont speak english i have many personal experiences where some worker could not understand me and i therefore stopped patronizing that employer i know many people who have had similar experiences and employers as well what about their rights employers should have the right to hire people who can do the job including speaking english to the customer mr millers comments are in the long tradition of social engineers who want to make over our country our society and even our culture into their vision of a benevolent social welfare state his misguided opinion leads us down a dark path geoff aronson chicago ill rep george millers letter in response to john fund "english only showdown " nov sounds very high minded but it ignores the realities on the ground recently i stopped at a well known fast food restaurant four young men stood in front of me and placed their orders with a young woman who was speaking a form of english with which i am not familiar after much back and forth they finally made themselves understood and the orders were entered she then turned to a foreign born employee in the back to relay the order the order was conveyed and misunderstood half a dozen times before a young man left the take out window to assist in translating the order between the two the order was delivered and as the young men walked out the door one of them said "i didnt order these onion rings " amusing until you realize that a non english speaking assistant in a nursing home is delivering someones medications peter tutini bowie md george miller states "principles of nondiscrimination are fundamental to american values " i would like to ask him where in the constitution does he find the commandment "thou shall not discriminate " expanding the rights of one group employees can only be achieved by contracting the rights of another group employers the more fundamental principle of men free to live and trade with each other without fear of government reprisals trumps his so called "principle of nondiscrimination " r menendez m d el paso texas
