hot topic behind the iran intelligence reversal a new u s intelligence report concluded that iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in a reversal of findings issued two years ago and underscored the challenges facing the intelligence community the surprise assessment followed intelligence community changes triggered by faulty intelligence reports on iraq that fueled the run up to war by asserting that saddam hussein possessed chemical and biological weapons and was pursuing nuclear weapons the new estimate could decelerate already sluggish diplomatic efforts to suspend irans uranium enrichment program by the united nations security council and calls into question washingtons increasingly hawkish rhetoric toward tehran heres a closer look how definitive are national intelligence estimates the estimates reflect the consensus opinion of the nations intelligence agencies and while they provide a snapshot of current judgments about future events estimates dont always deliver the final word on a subject the conclusions of a iraq estimate were wrong in part because analysts according to a senate investigation were led to "ignore or minimize" evidence that iraq didnt have an active program to develop weapons of mass destruction some conservative critics received the new iran estimate skeptically and republican senators called for a review of the contradictory conclusions what prompted the new conclusions officials said a combination of new intelligence and a review of old evidence not a "smoking gun" or single piece of evidence prompted the new assessment the estimate reasserted the intelligence communitys independence by reaching potentially inconvenient conclusions for policy makers and included new language stating what the agencies "did not know " that shift is a signal that "intelligence reform is moving forward " says ellen laipson a former vice chairwoman of the national intelligence council the government body responsible for issuing such assessments but she says the shift also suggests that in "adapting to the bruising experience of getting iraq wrong " the intelligence community may be "overcompensating in the other direction " washington shuffled the intelligence community after the iraq invasion creating a new director of national intelligence that effectively demoted the head of the central intelligence agency in the invasions aftermath a plus page report that criticized intelligence shortcomings also warned that the u s knew "disturbingly little about the nuclear programs of the worlds most dangerous actors " could iran still develop nuclear weapons yes the estimate didnt revise earlier predictions that iran could have a nuclear weapon by around and concluded with only "moderate confidence" that iran hasnt restarted its program at a congressional hearing on thursday a senior u s intelligence official cautioned against the idea that iranian ambitions were "benign " one big reason for the uncertainty iran continues to enrich uranium to produce nuclear fuel which it says is part of a civilian energy program and which is permitted under the nuclear non proliferation treaty some in the u s and europe worry that iran is using the treatys cover to produce nuclear fuel that could someday be used for weapons in part because iran doesnt have an operating nuclear power plant and has plenty of other fuel sources available irans nuclear program began in when the shah purchased a research reactor from the u s last month the international atomic energy association reported that iran had nearly centrifuges operating at its natanz nuclear facility enough to make a nuclear weapon and an increase from a year earlier what prompted iran to halt its weapons program the intelligence estimate suggested iran shelved its weapons program in after the covert effort had been exposed and iran had come under increasing international pressure the covert program led the iaea to conclude that tehran had violated international agreements and recommended the case to the u n security council which has since approved two rounds of limited economic sanctions how could it change international pressure on iran while the new intelligence report isnt likely to erase doubts about irans nuclear intentions the assessment likely will frustrate efforts to put further international pressure on tehran the reversal of u s intelligence assessments "is so dramatic that iran will be able to dismiss any effort to impose limits on its nuclear activities that go beyond the narrow interpretation of existing rules " wrote george perkovich an expert at the washington based carnegie endowment for international peace who first suggested two years ago that the intelligence community check to see whether iran had suspended its weapons program nick timiraos points of view the estimate doesnt do anything to change my opinion about the danger iran poses to the world quite the contrary " president bush this was a final shot to those who spread a sense of threat and concern in the world through lies of nuclear weapons iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad facts some of iranians believe iran will have a nuclear weapon in the next years compared with of americans according to a december poll by the program on international policy attitudes a national intelligence estimate this year concluded iran was playing only a minimal role in fueling sectarian violence in iraq a view that contrasted with white house accusations the u s has enforced sanctions against iran since the state department eased those sanctions in to allow americans to purchase rugs dried fruits nuts and caviar from iran in the years first quarter chinas exports to iran increased by to &# billion and russias exports by to &# million german
