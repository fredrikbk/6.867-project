weekend journal sports golf journal the cruelest week in golf pga tours q school ends in riches or tears this is about keeping your job winter park fla the most memorable moment for me last week at the famously brutal pga tour qualifying school occurred in an obscure corner of the clubhouse lobby moments after the final round of the final stage ended monday a young player had just missed earning his playing privileges on tour by a two stroke margin for several minutes he and his girlfriend holding hands talked quietly with each other then he ducked into the mens room and the woman turning her face to the wall started sobbing my guess is that her breakdown wasnt caused so much by disappointment at the results as a consolation prize near miss players earn eligibility to play full time on the tours developmental nationwide tour as by a need to release the pent up emotions of the week for the players q school as this tournament is known has long been considered the toughest week in professional golf but its often just as hard or even harder on the friends and family who come to watch and lend their support bravely by the time her man returned the woman had her beaming game face back on the first golf story i ever wrote was about the q school and some things about the event have changed in the years since its tougher than ever now to earn a tour card at q school mostly because the competitors arrive with deeper experience "theyve all got great games now from playing on the international tours or the nationwide tour " said duffy waldorf who happened to have finished first at that q school despite having won four tour events and &# million since he didnt play well enough last season to keep his regular card and so had to attempt to requalify which he did by two strokes but paradoxically mr waldorf said q school is slightly less nerve racking than it used to be "the difference is if they dont earn their card they can go back to those tours and still earn a living back when i started out the tour was all there was " pros who washed out might end up hustling lessons at a driving range one thing that hasnt changed however is the formats inherent cruelty the players who made it to the final stage at orange county national some of whom had to survive as many as three qualifying tournaments were vying for cards actually plus ties those who succeeded got through the six rounds in strokes or better but six players unfortunately took strokes and so next year will miss out on the chance to play against tiger woods phil mickelson et al for the tours incredible purse of &# million nine players missed by two shots and as always there were tragic meltdowns miguel angel carballo of argentina after playing his first holes in under par finished double bogey bogey and bogey to miss his card by one shot the tour allows spectators at q school but doesnt actively encourage them "this is not a week for entertainment golf is a game yes but this week is about keeping your job " said frank lickliter ii who finished first he shot in each of his first two rounds to go under par which in relation to par were the best back to back rounds ever in a pga tour event but almost no one was there to see them mr lickliters gallery consisted only of his pregnant wife and for a while his best friend "the last thing you want out here is any kind of distraction " he said so sparse are the galleries some groups literally have no one following them except the official scorer that as a spectator you cant help but worry that your very presence might freak out a player some players such as alejandro canizares send out vibes that way when i started following him halfway through the fifth round his body language wasnt positive a wiry goateed spaniard whose father jose maria is a european golf legend mr canizares was slumping over his club after nearly every shot i soon learned from his agent and his girlfriend that he had three putted his ninth hole of the day and shortly before that double bogeyed a par three to go from being "inside the number" or the projected cut line to outside it but on the back nine he made a string of birdie putts and he was serene enough afterward to chat with me a bit among the things i learned was that his preround rituals had been disrupted that morning by a minute fog delay and that he is superstitiously strict about wearing only specific pieces of underwear on the days he competes by contrast another member of mr canizaress group a first time q schooler named dustin johnson seemed impervious to the pressure mr johnson a tall broad shouldered rookie from south carolina who competed as an amateur in the walker cup competition in september was routinely hitting the ball yards past mr canizares on his way to a he earned his tour card the next day as did mr canizares "he gets excited but not nervous its something you just cant teach " his coach told me early in the final round i fell in with a half dozen family members following bubba dickerson and at first they seemed at ease too "were christians so weve been praying a lot " his wife mindy told me with a laugh when i asked about her nerves she said her husband knew she was out there and wanted her to be but they almost never spoke a few minutes later as if to confirm that he passed within feet of her after sinking a long birdie putt but didnt even glance in her direction "thats fine with me " she said "i want his head to be in the game not with me " mr dickerson won the u s amateur in but in two years on tour has played spottily "weve been working on getting his swing back to where it was when he won the amateur so thats all hes trying to do today is just play golf " said his coach and father bob dickerson also present but when i caught up with the dickerson clan again at the th hole they were visibly on edge mr dickerson had lost one stroke to par and was right on the cut line i hope someday he is able to forget what happened next his approach shot appeared to stop feet from the hole but then horribly trickled a few more inches picked up steam and rolled off the green into a swale some feet away he tried to chip it close enough to one putt for par but failed and fell to his knees clamping his hands over his head in anguish "that approach shot was perfect it just didnt hold " he told me after the round still only barely composed mr dickerson finished at under par one shot outside the number email me at golfjournal wsj com
