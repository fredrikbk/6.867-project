green thumb credit crunch provides opening in muni bonds there is a silver lining for investors resulting from the bond market tumult unusually high yields on tax exempt bonds muni bonds of course have an attractive feature you dont pay state local or federal taxes on the income because of that the yields are typically lower than on taxable securities such as u s treasurys it can be a big gap going back to the yield on the average top rated year muni bond has been only of the yield offered on the year treasury munis maturing in years averaged a yield that was of comparable treasurys but right now investors can essentially get the tax advantage at no cost this week the average year muni yielded which is just about the same as a u s year bond to get the same after tax yield an investor in the top tax bracket in a high tax state like new york would need to earn on a treasury bond thats "really attractive " says financial planner harold evensky of course if there is a lesson hammered home by this years wild bond markets it is this when you see a yield thats unusually high theres going to be a reason two factors are responsible for driving yields on municipal bonds to these unusual heights the first is that investors have been selling anything not issued directly by the federal government irrespective of the issuers credit worthiness that has included an aversion to debt issued by state and local governments second the municipal bond market has been rattled by concerns about the financial health of companies that insure bond issuers against defaulting on their interest payments these insurers also guaranteed bonds backed by low quality mortgages and are under pressure to back up those guarantees or face ratings downgrades though it is considered unlikely such downgrades would most likely lead to the downgrade of muni debt those companies also insure that in turn would send prices on those bonds lower and yields even higher bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices in the short term the uncertainty about muni bond insurers creates what wall street pros call "headline risk" for investors holding those bonds but they argue that the underlying credit worthiness of muni bonds is extremely high earlier this year moodys investors service completed a study of default rates on high rated muni bonds and found that just failed to make good on interest payments a far lower rate than on corporate bonds if bonds get downgraded because of a problem with the insurers or because the slowing economy has an impact on the issuer that bond is going to take a hit in price but if youre a long term investor who intends to hold a security for years you can ride that out and even if a bond goes from carrying a triple a rating to a double a rating "thats still a very high quality investment " says says daniel solender director of municipal bond management at lord abbett &amp co email tom lauricella wsj com manna in munis yields on tax exempt bonds have been higher than normal keep in mind yields are almost on a par with some taxable debt watch out for risk that muni bond insurers could run into trouble with mortgage tied debt high credit quality and a history of minimal defaults may be a cushion
