weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink a bowl of yuletide cheer dump it in " these are the opening words in the first story that jack london ever sold a tale of christmas in the klondike in "to the man on trail " the malemute kid is making a formidable christmas punch with anything and everything at hand in a humble snowbound cabin even "pepper sauce " there never has been one fixed american approach to holiday punch the malemute kids strategy emptying ones shelves into the bowl was a common one patrick gavin duffys post prohibition catalog of american drinks "the official mixers manual " includes one such recipe for christmas punch start with various juices and fruits add a quart of strong tea then add a bottle of rye a bottle of brandy a bottle of rum and a half bottle of benedictine top it all off with a couple of bottles of champagne i recently worked my way through just about every christmas punch recipe i could find when i mixed up duffys and offered a glass to a friend he took one sip and said "that tastes like a hangover " no wonder christmas punch developed a reputation as a drink guaranteed to sneak up on revelers and leave them reeling though it should be noted that these debilitating effects were once a great boon to the fledgling republic legend has it that the battle of trenton which followed gen george washingtons audacious crossing of the delaware in a christmas night blizzard was won in part because the hessian troops garrisoned there were sleeping off the effects of too much punch their commander col johann rall was presented with an urgent note warning him of the advancing rebels but he had been too busy playing cards and drinking a christmas whiskey punch to read it the kitchen sink christmas punch has not always had the most cheerful of connotations especially in contrast to more elegant holiday enjoyments charles dickens in one of his earliest essays writing under the pen name "boz " says that christmas punch is capable of sparking maudlin musings on the years "adversity and misfortune " it wasnt the depressive effect of the alcohol itself that might cause such "dismal reminiscences " but rather the quality of the drink and the "reduced circumstances and straitened incomes" it represented "if your room be smaller than it was a dozen years ago or if your glass be filled with reeking punch instead of sparkling wine put a good face on the matter and empty it off hand " dickens urges "and thank god its no worse " not exactly an endorsement of the old yuletide bowl but the essay foreshadowed the themes that dickens would take up in "a christmas carol " and as william makepeace thackeray put it that story "caused a wonderful outpouring of christmas good feeling of christmas punch brewing an awful slaughter of christmas turkeys " by the turn of the th century dickenss divide between christmas punch and sparkling wine had been well breached in the u s where champagne had become a standard ingredient in the punch tom ochiltree a rather fantastical character whose career spanned days as a texas ranger a newspaperman and a congressman favored a "highly refreshing christmas beverage" made of champagne cognac lemons and soda water though he joked that "in consequence of advancing years i always forget the aerated water " in the heady jingoistic days of cooks a domestic brand of sparkling wine ran ads urging that christmas punch be used to toast "american supremacy " to a bottle of cooks one was to add some sugar sliced fruit soda water and a slug each of brandy orange curacao and apricot liqueur the cooks recipe was pretty typical of the times though the theme was often embellished in the trenton evening times published a recipe that in addition to the fizzy wine brandy and curacao also called for shots of the green and yellow varieties of the french liqueur chartreuse and a quart of oolong tea but of all the recipes i tried spanning a good hundred years two drinks promoted in by the french industry associations for champagne and cognac proved to be my favorites one of them called french christmas punch is nearly a hybrid of the cooks and trenton evening times recipes adding cognac yellow chartreuse maraschino liqueur not the syrup from a cherry jar curacao lemon juice and sugar to the champagne if thats not sweet enough for you try the merry christmas punch which replaces the lemon juice and the herbal chartreuse with a bottle of sauternes either punch is delightful and likely to accomplish what "malemute kids frightful concoction" did no doubt describing a scene he witnessed in his own hardscrabble days up north jack london said that in drinking the kids punch "the men of the camps and trails unbent in its genial glow" and "aliens from a dozen lands they toasted each and all " we could do worse this holiday season than to follow their lead after all as the kid says "a christmas without punch is sinking a hole to bedrock with nary a pay streak "
