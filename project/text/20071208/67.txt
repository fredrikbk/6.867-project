weekend journal books the ne plus ultra of languages ad infinitum by nicholas ostler walker pages &# carpe diem by harry mount hyperion pages &# for generations of adults the simple word series "amo amare amavi amatus" used to act as a kind of madeleine calling to mind long classroom hours spent conjugating latin verbs including this one meaning "love" then exploring gaul in its three parts and eventually trying to puzzle out the syntax of the rugged lines that followed "arma virumque cano " the opening phrase of virgils "the aeneid " a few lucky students in that era of required latin reveled in the ablative absolute and exulted at their ability to piece together the meaning of a latin sentence from the seemingly random scattering of stems and inflections most students it is safe to say found the experience more trying than pleasant some like winston churchill might even recall primitive pedagogy and physical brutality from their latin teachers but no one finished his years of latin class without at least a grim respect for a language that could demand so much of young readers centuries after the fall of rome nicholas ostler and harry mount lament latins decline of cultural stature in recent decades mr ostlers "ad infinitum" is an absorbing scholarly account of the history of the latin language from its origins in antiquity to its afterlife in our own time mr mounts "carpe diem" is a breezy attempt to show that learning latin is easy and fun both authors are british born and oxford educated and both engaging writers but their responses to declining latinity are different mr mount is cheerier he is heartened that latin "still blossoms today in the oddest of places " noting inter alia a latin phrase tattooed on angelina jolies belly mr ostler for his part resigns himself to the belief that latin has little place in a world of "decidability radioactivity plate tectonics " his parting words are lugubrious sic transit gloria mundi "so the glory of the world must pass " but he takes solace in the immortal glory of latin are things so bad between and enrollments in american public high school latin classes averaged far below the robust who studied the language in but holding steady the national latin exam a voluntary skill gauging test has seen the annual number of test takers rise to more than in from in at tiny hillsdale college in michigan with students lorna holmes a classics professor who calls her blend of passion and hard nosed grammar "old fashioned " has students in greek and in latin at this very moment mirabile dictu there is now even a searchable electronic repository of all latin texts from the earliest records through the second century anyone who is interested can buy it for less than the cost of an evening on the town in short the renaissance is not yet in sight but neither are we living in the dark ages those who understand the power of words carefully chosen and artfully arranged will find mr ostlers linguistic history deeply satisfying he traces the emergence of latin and its triumph over the languages of ancient italy setting the development of latin within the political and military history of rome he shows how latin comes of age and gains self conscious elegance under greek influence grammar played a key role in this transformation mr ostler appropriately reminds us that the word "glamour" derives from "grammar " while the spread of christianity added centuries of life to latin after the fall of rome mr ostler notes latin in turn was the powerful unifier of christianity but the paradigm that latin established for precise usage would ultimately standardize the languages of modern europe and shake latin from its pedestal quotations from horace cicero augustine and others grace the headings of mr ostlers chapters while "ad infinitum" treats its readers with the dignity of roman citizens "carpe diem" assumes that they are barbarians the book mixes basic verb and noun charts and short vocabulary lists with bits of roman history and culture and details from mr mounts personal life including a tasteless description of one of his latin teachers sexual proclivities mr mount decries the lowering of standards in british schools but his book doesnt do a lot to raise them he provides in his history chapter a series of short cheeky sketches of the roman emperors tiberius "made the mistake of getting too pally with a minion" that is sejanus the head of the praetorian guard together vespasian titus and domitian receive less than four lines under the heading "various non entities " marcus aurelius is called "avant garde " but were not told that he was a stoic "if youve read this book properly " mr mount writes " you can lean deep into your armchair and bemoan how second rate everybody elses latin is " perhaps but ironical elitism shouldnt be the point would that mr mount understood his quotation from william hazlitt "the study of classics teaches us to believe that there is something really great and excellent in the world surviving all the shocks of accident and fluctuations of opinion " it is a note that mr mount himself might have sounded more often we are reminded by hazlitts words and mr ostlers long narrative that literature from centuries ago can speak to hearts and minds in times and places far removed from its origins latin has earned its immortality and its claim on our time mr poliakoff is vice president for academic affairs and research at the university of colorado in boulder
