the weekend interview with arthur mutambara we who believe in democracy zimbabwe is in the news this weekend as its year old strongman robert mugabe arrives in lisbon portugal to attend his first european union summit meeting in seven years his appalling human rights record has led british prime minister gordon brown to boycott the meeting while the spotlight has not recently been on this deeply troubled land there are dissidents who do not want the world to forget earlier this year i met with one of them a tall charismatic year old who attended the aspen ideas festival an annual chatfest of thinkers and well heeled idealists sponsored by the aspen institute but arthur mutambara who leads one of the main opposition groups fighting the mugabe tyranny wasnt in the colorado rockies to exchange pleasantries he startled the crowd with blunt language that isnt normal parlance for politicians from the developing world "we africans are responsible for our problems and we must take charge of our lives " he said in a commanding deep voice reminiscent of james earl jones "we must move away from aid to genuine investment we must ensure that after getting rid of a dictator we plant deep roots for the rule of law and actually improve the lot of the people so when we who believe in democracy triumph i ask you to judge us harshly if we fail to live up to our promises " the crowd responded with a standing ovation and while it might be a performance it was a refreshing one ive had a soft spot for mr mutambaras beautiful country since i visited zimbabwe in the s and observed its largely peaceful and successful transition from white domination to black rule but all that has changed even before the final collapse of apartheid mr mugabe massacred members of the minority ndebele tribe using his north korean trained troops he then created a virtual one party state after political rival joshua nkomo fled the country fearing assassination mr mugabe didnt touch the economy or basic civil liberties until when following voter rejection of his proposed constitution he initiated the confiscation of private farmland the confiscation has led to famine police terror and prompted at least one quarter of the countrys million people to flee mr mutambara led student demonstrations against mr mugabes corrupt zanu pf party at the university of zimbabwe until when he won twin rhodes and fulbright scholarships and departed to study science at oxford he received a doctorate in robotics in and went on to become an associate professor at mit a visiting scientist at nasa and a management consultant at mckinsey today he is a man with a mission "my work overseas was fascinating but i never forgot my homeland or that i would return to it " he told me as we walked around the aspen institutes grounds he did go back in and promptly plunged into politics a field that this man of science and business admits often defies rational analysis "too many countries see meaningless changes in leadership " he says they need a transformation that has both form and substance " he adds his eyes flashing and his frustration obvious in early mr mutambara was elected leader of a breakaway faction of the movement for democratic change the main opposition party founded in by morgan tsvangirai a labor organizer but mr tsvangirai eventually alienated many of his partys members with his perceived highhandedness today mr mutambara and mr tsvangirai each head factions with a roughly equal number of seats in parliament they bitterly disagree on how to dislodge mr mugabe and the two men alternate between solidarity and rivalry in march both were arrested tortured by mr mugabes secret police and then paraded together before a court before being released but only weeks later they were trading insults mr mutambara accused mr tsvangirai of being "an intellectual midget " and in turn was attacked for being absent from the country for years while his people suffered both men agree on the need to present a united front in elections that are scheduled for next march but their failure to nail down how only makes the job of mr mugabe a past master at vote rigging and intimidation all the easier the ruling zanu pf regime has just passed a new law allowing phone calls and emails to be monitored another law will gerrymander parliament in its favor mr mugabe also has no intention of letting the three million expatriate zimbabweans vote he is fully aware of how election rules can be rigged to frustrate popular majorities in the white national party first came to power in south africa losing the popular vote but winning a parliamentary majority of underpopulated rural seats apartheid and the stripping of the right to vote from indian and mixed race voters were in part a national party strategy to ensure it would win all future elections mr mutambaras hope is that leaders of the country southern african development community will be able to pressure mr mugabe into agreeing to new election rules and international supervision of the march vote in exchange for help in staving off economic collapse thabo mbeki south africas president has been leading talks between zanu pf and the opposition mdc so far only minor progress has been made but mr mutambara says "i believe mbeki wants to build a legacy as a regional peacemaker he also knows that south africa cant hold a truly successful world cup in if its neighbor to the north is engulfed in chaos " its hard to describe the chaos that zimbabwe is slipping into the international monetary fund reported last month that inflation could reach in a matter of weeks mr mugabe has responded by arresting people for violating his price controls meat produce cooking oil and basic medicines are usually available only on the black market the united nations estimates that four million zimbabweans will need food handouts by next year a high school teacher admitted to the london times that she is selling sexual services to mugabe henchmen along with "three quarters" of her colleagues in order to buy food for her children nonetheless it was still jarring this summer to hear archbishop pius ncube the head of zimbabwes one million catholics openly call on britain the former colonial power to invade the country "i think it is justified for britain to raid zimbabwe and remove mugabe " he told western reporters "we should do it ourselves but theres too much fear im ready to lead the people guns blazing but the people are not ready " but that may be slowly changing zimpundit a local blogger who remains anonymous for obvious reasons says the fact that both messrs tsvangirai and mutambara have been brutally beaten has changed the publics attitudes toward demonstrations and strikes "people feared them because they felt they were being used as political pawns by leaders who didnt want to endure the wrath of the police on their own " zimpundit writes "tsvangirai and mutambara have because of this torture gained more credibility with people look for this to spawn more protest " thats just as well since of course there is no prospect of a british invasion but british prime minister gordon brown should consider creating a foreign aid package that would be contingent on mr mugabes departure an offer such as this could act as an incentive for mugabes underlings to overthrow him and restore some sanity to the economy i ask mr mutambara about his own plans for zimbabwes economy should the opposition take power "first we implement a stabilization plan to stop the rot " he says counting off on his fingers "pegging the currency to something of real value is top priority second a plan to restore the half of our economy thats been destroyed "bringing in honest judges to enforce contracts and reassure investors is key third we need to bring in scientific expertise to restore our place as a breadbasket of africa and create a manufacturing base that can compete on cost and quality " how big a role does he envision free markets playing in a new zimbabwe "i appreciate the success you get when people can create wealth fifty years ago ghana had the same gdp as singapore now it has a per capita income greater than germany france or britain " he notes "our economy should be liberated we need creative dreamers who do not fear globalization " but when it comes to details mr mutambara admits there will be healthy elements of a mixed economy he sees key sectors such as railroads remaining in state hands as for mr mugabes lawless confiscations white farmers who saw their land seized and fled the country shouldnt expect to get it back though mr mutambara is intrigued by voucher schemes that were used in eastern europe to partly compensate victims of communist expropriations what about the treatment of mr mugabes collaborators once his regime has fallen "no blanket amnesty if youve committed genocide there will be responsibility " he says "but there are aspects of what south africa has done that we can learn from their truth commission allowed victims to confront their oppressors receive some restorative justice and then move on " mr mutambara is himself constantly in motion at aspen alternately speaking as a freedom fighter and a politician who clearly wants to appeal to both liberals and conservatives in the west at one aspen event he waxes lyrically about the need to strive for "collective humanity global sovereignty and global dignity " a string of empty buzz words that nonetheless leaves a warm glow with his audience at another panel participants debate if curbing global warming will be compatible with economic growth he nods enthusiastically as a speaker points out that the hundreds of millions of africans who have never turned on a light switch wont tolerate being left behind economically if the world pursues carbon caps "a person living in darfur cant afford to be green " mr mutambara reminded the audience during the q&amp a as mr mutambara prepares to pack to fly home to zimbabwe i ask him about his own safety doesnt he worry about what the regime could do to him he says he would if he werent convinced the zanu pf leaders are "both moral and physical cowards" who are unsure of what might happen if prominent opposition leaders such as himself are killed it is also a relief to know his wife and children are in south africa while he is on the front line but he recognizes the risks he faces every time he returns "after all it was your founding fathers who said give me liberty or death " he says flashing a broad smile "i plan to gain the first but i know i have to risk the second to get it " mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com
