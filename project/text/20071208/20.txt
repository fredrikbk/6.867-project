plastic surgeon "its something ive noticed and some colleagues have noticed as well " while anecdotal the industry chatter is the latest worrying hint of a broader slowdown in consumer spending which accounts for of the u s economy and fodder for a broader debate on how deep such a slowdown might bite the big question is whether the triple whammy of falling home prices still high energy prices and
