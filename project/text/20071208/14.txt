editorial board miracle in the holy land jerusalem here is the past " says benjamin netanyahu "thats the future " the likud leader at his knesset office is talking about jerusalem and tel aviv less than an hours drive apart but on different planets if regional turmoil and political intrigue hang heavy over this ancient capital the party town along the mediterranean brims with entrepreneurial energy and of late tel avivs youthful capitalist spirit is rubbing off on the rest of israel little noticed amid the grim middle east headlines a jewish state founded by european socialists and long hobbled by stagnant growth and inflation is turning into a mature market economy this ongoing transformation is no less dramatic than eastern europes since in the past half generation an economy dominated by the state and monopolies began to join the outside world but it was a dose of shock therapy israeli style in that jolted the country out of its deep sleep that year when mr netanyahu took over the finance ministry a deep recession and debt burden put israel in his words "on the verge of an argentina like collapse " subsequent cuts in welfare benefits the removal of remaining currency and capital controls and liberalization of the banking sector didnt make mr netanyahu many friends but today even his detractors hardly an elite club in israel credit him for the recovery the third consecutive year of strong growth up to in is driven by exports of software pharmaceuticals consulting and other services the or so hi tech start ups located in and around tel aviv and haifa give the coast the feel of silicon valley only with a gaza strip down the road israelis are now investing heavily abroad only the u s and canada have more technology companies listed on american exchanges than israel signaling that these changes are supposed to be permanent the government in tapped a new central bank chief whom israeli politicians couldnt easily push around stanley fischer made his name at mit and later as no at the imf born in todays zambia he first came to israel at to work on a kibbutz upon his return two years ago he found that socialist traditions today coexist with a modernizing economy even at the bank of israel his staff went on strike last month a reminder of organized labors sway in the country but he sees the trend lines going in the other direction "as the economy develops the power relations will change " mr fischer says pointing out that unions went along with mr netanyahus budget cuts labor reforms and the slow shift to private pension schemes taxes are falling though with the top individual rate at they are still high "the government has been squeezed very hard in the last four to five years " he adds with spending down from of gdp on par with scandinavian countries in "hopefully well finish this year at or below " in a speech in hong kong mr fischer called for the imf to push countries to gradually remove restrictions on capital flows his experience in israel has shown that liberalization is more important than he thought "this economy is totally changed but totally changed from years ago when it had capital controls " he says "i knew the technical issues of getting rid of capital controls what i didnt realize is that it also forces people to change their approach " in a protected economy business focuses on local markets and exports "the full opening of the capital account in the context of globalization made everyone realize they had to compete in the world " he says "israeli businessmen are of a different quality than years ago " israel hasnt had reason to regret it inflation is around down from in the s the country is unaffected by the subprime shake out with the shekel stable mr fischer doesnt have a weakening currency on his hands as does his most famous graduate student from his mit days fed chief ben bernanke "whatever exchange rate system you have there will be days when you wished you had another one " mr fischer says with a smile but "so far so good " the netanyahu reforms shook up the structure of the economy without changing the countrys political culture spending pressures are re emerging the state owns too much land "only " deadpans mr netanyahu now in opposition israel needs a far more serious dose of liberalization to become another ireland a small low tax investment driven boom economy "trying to explain market economics to our politicians is like trying to explain sex to a eunuch " says daniel doron who runs the center for social and economic progress in tel aviv israel cant afford a return to expensive welfare policies it already spends north of of gdp on defense this wont soon change the economy is handicapped by the lowest labor participation rate of any developed country one in four ultra orthodox working age jewish men and about as few israeli arab women hold down jobs that leaves only of israelis in the work force compared with around in a typical western country as a result income per worker is on par with europe notes economist omer moav but per capita significantly lower with the right policies mr netanyahu says israel could grow at an irish like for a decade but its experience already shows that strong human capital and an opening market are the best resources any country could ask for a good lesson for the oil rich middle east and while far from finished the mini revolution of recent years ties israel into the world and vice versa thats good news for its future prosperity and security
