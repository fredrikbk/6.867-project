weekend journal gearing up recreation how to throw like a pro former nfl qb phil simms on the secret mechanics of hurling a football take a kidney bean blow it up to the size of an eggplant shave both ends to a point cover it with slick leather and fill it with quarters now go outside and try to throw it accurately this is in rough terms the challenge millions of americans will face this holiday season during ritual backyard football games never mind that footballs werent meant to be thrown in the first place the sport was derived from rugby a game with no forward passes or that no two coaches seem to agree on how this skill should be taught the ability to throw a spiral remains one of the most unforgiving litmus tests of american manhood its also one of the toughest to fake physicists say a football needs to spin to be gyroscopically stable but as soon as its airborne wind and gravity will try to knock it from its axis and make it wobble like a slow bicycle that a quarterback can throw one of these things yards and hit a moving target "is just amazing " says william rae professor emeritus of aerospace engineering at the university at buffalo for those who want to master the skill phil simms the year old former new york giants quarterback agreed to share his secrets on technique at his home in franklin lakes n j though he won a super bowl with the giants in the season mr simms says it wasnt until about when he retired and started teaching his two sons to throw that he immersed himself in the mechanics of passing since then simms has become an nfl color commentator for cbs and emerged as an expert on passing technique he has written a book called "phil simms on passing" and tutored several promising quarterbacks at no charge from nearby schools if hed known what he knows now while he was still playing he says "i would have set records " until football was a running game the forward pass was foisted upon it when university presidents became outraged at the number of deaths on the field which hit an estimated in college footballs rules committee which included legendary coach amos alonzo stagg created the pass to spread the game out it didnt become popular until the s when the ncaa and the national football league adopted a standard ball size since then the popularity of the forward pass has grown to the point where its hard to imagine football without it today about of nfl plays involve passing current nfl quarterbacks arent always the best passing role models among the leagues starters there are different ways of throwing the ball mr simms says few of which approach anything close to perfection mr simms says he first started to rethink his own passing technique when jim fassel came to the giants as an assistant coach in under his tutelage mr simms says he started clasping the ball with two hands which reduced fumbles he held the ball low at his chest instead of up near his shoulder which improved his release time by keeping his arm and body relaxed his throws became more accurate after retiring he took his study further and created drills that reinforce specific aspects of his passing technique the first thing he tells students is to take a deep breath and relax tension and a too tight grip on the ball can be the downfall of a passer tight muscles inhibit movement at the joints he says causing the arm to work as one object like a catapult when its limp and the joints move the arm acts as a whip ball grip is a matter of preference he says holding it over the laces helps add spin but holding it without using the laces is ok too one grip has the middle and ring fingers over the laces and the index finger just behind them but someone with smaller hands can grab the ball closer to the point where the circumference is shorter most people throw by drawing the football back behind their ear and pushing it forward but pushing the ball makes it difficult to impart spin mr sims says instead the arm should whip with the help of torque created at the waist another misconception is that a spiral can be achieved only by launching the ball as hard as possible softly thrown balls can have spin too some of the drills mr simms has come up with to teach these principles are unorthodox so much so that a few coaches have refused to let their young quarterbacks train with him for fear hell ruin them tom martinez who began coaching new england patriots quarterback tom brady when he was and now heads up the quarterbacking branch of an invitation only camp for gifted players says he doesnt share the simms philosophy instead of teaching one rigid technique mr martinez says he works with a throwers existing style and tries to make it more consistent and repeatable those who think they have a good handle on the spiral would be well served by standing on the receiving end of the simms version after licking his fingers to get a better grip and setting his feet he uncoils a series of identical passes that cover yards with alarming speed delivering a sting to the palms of anyone not wearing oven mitts "ive thrown over a million " mr simms says modestly secrets of the spiral a four step guide to achieving a perfect throw step hold the ball with two hands relaxed at chest level your body is open to the field but angled so your throwing shoulder and rear leg are back a bit step decide where you want to throw the ball point your forward shoulder at the target and take a step with your forward foot but keep your head from moving forward your body is now cocked ready to create the torque you need to throw the ball step quickly rotate forward around your waist keep two hands on the ball until youre about to release it let the ball spin off your hand as you follow through with the throw step on the follow through your thumb should be pointed down indicating you used torque from the waist to throw the ball rather than pushing it forward after making the pass you should naturally take a couple of steps back as your body recoils outfitted more launch ables projectiles can help you perfect your spiral skill or learn a new one aerobie football &# the curved fins on this football make it possible for anyone to throw a spiral delicate arch se &# boomerangs are even harder to throw than footballs the delicate arch se in right and left handed versions can go yards and stay aloft seconds daredevil frostie &# as ultimate frisbee and frisbee golf gain in popularity manufacturers are filling more niches the frosties soft rubber is good for playing in cold weather passback
