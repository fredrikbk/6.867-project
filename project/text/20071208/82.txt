weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece the poets alchemy inspired by a tv documentary on mining perils philip larkin wrote a great poem only lines long anatomy of a classic one evening during the christmas holidays of philip larkin the pre eminent british poet of his generation watched a television documentary on the mining industry and its inherent dangers for those in the trade the program critics believe provided the "trigger " the emotional source for one of his greatest narrative poems "the explosion " it is an artful and telling connection because it validates larkins own thoughts on the process of poetry how poetry happens briefly explained it is a process in which a poet so impressed with an experience or image is compelled to construct a verbal device a poem that will reproduce his emotional concept recurrently in anyone who cares to read it anywhere anytime larkins composition time for "the explosion" was relatively brief he already had a sense of the mining culture for he had read d h lawrences writings of life in a mining village the poem was completed early in just weeks after the mining documentary was broadcast it is composed in the same meter as longfellows "hiawatha " though larkin said he was not aware of this when he created the poem published by the poem of the month club later that year it was included in "high windows " larkins last collection of verse released in the reception of the book was extraordinary considering that it was a collection of poetry thousands of copies were sold in the first weeks another edition rushed into print and larkin who was at the time a prominent figure in british poetry became in the words of a reviewer "a national monument " as a poet larkin was influenced by the novelist poet thomas hardy who also focused on intense personal emotion avoiding sentimentality or self pity in a similar assessment seamus heaney the irish poet and nobelist believes that there is a "crystalline reality" in larkins poetry that "refuses alibis" about the conditions of contemporary life with "the explosion " larkin achieves this in a mere lines in eight three line stanzas and a single almost isolated final line for all its concision its an ingenious accomplishment a masterpiece of poetry in the poems first stanza larkin begins with an everyday interpretation of the early morning of the disaster it is cast with a colloquial slant and a neat alliterative end though there is a sense of the ominous "on the day of the explosion shadows pointed towards the pithead in the sun the slagheap slept " images of a new day and a rugged camraderie appear in stanza two as we follow the men to the mine the poems journey is beginning "down the lane came men in pitboots coughing oath edged talk and pipe smoke shouldering off the freshened silence " in stanza three there is a pause in the poems movement an interlude ill call it that suggests innocence along the lane a young miner chases rabbits loses them but returns to his group with a nest of larks eggs that he has found and tenderly returns "showed them lodged them in the grasses " the use of the "lark" is perhaps larkins narrative signature or emphasis of the playfulness within the stanza then the poems pace quickens to its true theme of understanding and accepting our common destiny which a great poets work has the capacity to convey in "the explosion " larkin pairs death and fatalism love and beauty and explores mans affinity with the environment the ensuing stanzas include memorable lines essential to the poem with layered depths of meaning underscoring t s eliots suggestion that a poem can communicate before it is understood "through the tall gates standing open" is a stark image of a void an abyss and then the explosion reduced to a shudder by larkin "at noon there came a tremor cows stopped chewing for a second sun scarfed as in a heat haze dimmed " larkin cast stanza six alone in italics distinguishing it from the rest of the poem it is more than a dramatic turn he is separating the miners from their suffering their previous state "the dead go on before us they are sitting in gods house in comfort we shall see them face to face " the remaining two stanzas are larkins images of visions the bright visions of the miners wives "plain as lettering in the chapels it was said and for a second wives saw men of the explosion " in the final stanza a model of euphony the poet transforms the miners as they appear in the vision as golden sanctified figures "gold as on a coin or walking somehow from the sun towards them " the poem concludes with a vision of renewal and hope the larks eggs that were found and returned by the young miner now reappear in the poem in the hands of a miner in the group walking out of the sun "one showing the eggs unbroken " the darkness of the pit from which they have emerged is lit for an instance by larkins pure poetry james fenton former professor of poetry at oxford lectured there on larkins poetry writing that it expresses the common experience and "that it has its origin in the commonplace " to that statement add the sheer pathos of larkins poetry and you have "the explosion " worth listening to is mr fentons excellent reading of the poem for "poets night " an audiocassette produced by fsg penguin putnam tall bald bespectacled and gloomy larkin has been called a curmudgeon and worse he was indeed an accomplished complainer though his countenance if the novelist martin amis is correct was of "a mournful priestly gaze " larkin often self critical famously said that deprivation for him was what daffodils were for wordsworth larkin was a university librarian novelist and jazz critic writing monthly reviews for the daily telegraph the reviews were published in a book called "all what jazz " he was the leading voice of what was to be called "the movement " a group of young british writers who rejected the prevailing fashion for neo romantic writing larkin was a lifelong friend of the novelist kingsley amis martins father from their university days in response to larkins detailed suggestions amis heavily revised "lucky jim " his hugely popular novel larkin received the queens gold medal for poetry in though for health reasons he declined the honor of poet laureate of england in he died of esophageal cancer on dec biographers tell us that his last
