weekend journal holiday gift picks he shops she shops is it possible to give luxury gifts on a budget and not look like a miser two columnists debate she shops by laura landro when it comes to luxury this holiday season there is no shortage of extravagant bling on offer from the &# million carat uncut diamond necklace in the neiman marcus catalog to the &# minox digital camera with k gold plating and carat diamonds surrounding the lens at vivre com but with a chill in the economy gift buyers may be feeling more like cubic zirconia and disposable cameras with retailers bracing for the weakest sales growth in five years even the most profligate spenders may decide tis the season to batten down the hatches a bit of course that doesnt mean giving up the feel of luxury this season my colleague alan murray and i set out to find luxury gifts for the opposite sex for less one strategy buying from a high end designers lower priced line you can also try bargain hunting at the outlet mall on the web or at big box discounters where the wrapping may not be as nice but the price is right here are some ideas patterned ties as much as i love power ties from hermes and salvatore ferragamo at about &# to &# a pop they seem steep this year you can get similar designs featuring whimsical figures from vineyard vines a company based in marthas vineyard that specializes in the preppy look though some look a little goofy i found nice looking ties with a rope and starfish and an orca whale pattern &# from vineyardvines com alan responds off to a good start i love vineyard vines ties colorful fun and not too pretentious even if the economy were red hot id prefer these to hermes at twice the price faux exotic leathers accessories in exotic leathers like alligator python and crocodile can cost hundreds of dollars a number of retailers now offer reasonably priced knockoffs such as "classic croc" created by hand staining layers of color on calfskin with a glassy finish one of the best looking and most versatile is the &# croc embossed italian calfskin passport wallet from curranonline com alan fake crocodile laura you have taken a step down this holiday i wouldnt have wanted a real crocodile wallet so no need to buy me a fake one plain leather will do just fine keeping time instead of spending &# on a watch from cartiers new ballon bleu collection a travel clock of the same design will set you back &# if you really want the watch there are bargains to be had costco has a wide selection of high end mens watches including a cartier stainless steel tank francaise in k gold and stainless steel at &# compared with about &# at cartiers own stores cartier declines to comment other than to note costco isnt in its network of authorized dealers costco says it provides its own warranties for all the watches it sells alan amazing how quickly you went from fake croc to cartier its good to know though that when the day comes that i need a cartier watch i can save big bucks at costco who knew getting away while he may not be able to take a weeklong scuba diving vacation in the islands this year a spa weekend or afternoon tea at a luxury resort or hotel can help lessen the pain of course you get to go too with gift cards among the hottest items this holiday season order one from the four seasons hotel chain which lets you buy them in denominations from &# to &# up to &# personalized and presented in a nice box buy online at fourseasons com giftcard or at a four seasons hotel also available from the ritz carlton chain alan clever idea if youve got this kind of cash to spare go for it but youve got to give me carte blanche to choose the resort headphones top of the line bose noise canceling headphones can run &# or more but for music lovers who spend more time on their ipods than in front of the hi fi bose has mini headphones in an ear bud style with rich spectrum sound for ipods and dvd players for about &# in bose stores or at bose com alan ive listened to these babies and they are awesome if you are willing to spend a bit more you might even go for the &# "on ear" headphones he shops by alan murray satisfying her bordeaux tastes on my budweiser budget has always been my central dilemma in these shopping exercises so im glad my colleague laura landro has finally joined the challenge even if it took a sagging economy to change her ways i did my shopping this year on black friday far from the hordes sitting comfortably in front of a roaring fire in vermont i searched the internet on an unsecured broadband line courtesy of a neighbor if this is what laura means by power shopping i could learn to love it in the quest for discount dior and half priced prada the internet is an invaluable friend bargains abound and price comparison is easy even the most intimidating of department stores neiman marcus becomes less threatening when you see only gifts "priced under &# " there is also plenty of friendly sales advice a rare service in the real world during the holiday season my favorite was at gifts com where an automated gift guru asked a few questions to gauge lauras "personality " the site then served up several dozen ideas from multiple online vendors my favorite monogrammed umbrellas available at guess where neiman marcus for just &# a piece but there is a danger in hunting for designer discounts online knock offs abound my advice make sure you buy only from well established online stores some suggestions for the women in your life travel size products travel size tubes of bath and body products have become acceptable gifts in recent years thanks in part to the otherwise thankless folks at the transportation security administration who wont allow tubes larger than ounces on airplanes nordstrom offers a laura mercier "creme brulee" travel set that includes creme body wash sugar scrub and souffle body creme for &# i havent a clue what you do with this stuff but women seem to love it nordstrom com laura responds i do love laura mercier cosmetics and the travel sizes are a great idea though i may have to lose the sugar scrub in order to fit more practical items like toothpaste into that quart sized bag allowed for carry on luggage silk ties if hermes scarves are beyond your budget take a look at the companys "twillies " these thin ribbons of silk are inches wide and inches long again exactly what you do with them is a bit of a mystery to me but a fashionista is likely to find a suitable use &# hermes com laura actually the uses are many tie one on the handle of your purse trim the brim of your hat secure one around a ponytail but i can save alan &# by suggesting the hermes pocket square scarf which can be folded and tied jauntily with a womans open collared blouse tiffany gifts half a nod to tiffany for allowing online shoppers to search for gifts priced under &# but its a small collection i prefer shopping at blue nile where you can get a freshwater cultured pearl pendant on a gold chain for &# if you know her eyes will light up at that blue box regardless of whats in it tiffany sells a candle in a crystal votive for &# tiffany com bluenile com laura the under &# tiffany gifts include some pretty decorative objects like a porcelain oval wildflowers vase as for the jewelry i cant get past my feeling that theyre better suited for the younger set so they may be re gifted or rather bequeathed to one of my nieces sooner rather than later discount designers the bluefly site is full of discounted designer merchandise from fendi theres a "double f" mini messenger bag that sells for &# and a leather french wallet for &# those prices may still seem high but they beat what youll find at some department stores bluefly com laura i once got a birthday card that said "if its wrong to love an accessory then im wrong as wrong can be " enough said ill happily take them all
