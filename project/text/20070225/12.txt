travel watch rental car insurance what you need rental car companies are keen to offer insurance along with the vehicle but with a growing number of credit cards and auto insurers promising to pick up the tab for damages to a rented car are the policies worth the money before you answer with an automatic yes or no take a good look at what each company is actually offering you may be surprised a credit card for instance will typically offer protection for damages to the car but wont pay for harm toanother person or vehicle that means you could be accountable if you cause an accident and someone gets hurt your auto insurance policy on the other hand will probably cover harm to people and property but wont pay the rental company for "loss of use " a charge thats incurred when a rental is out of commission for repairs or replacement the two most common products sold at the rental car counter are the "collision damage waiver " which isnt technically insurance and "supplemental liability insurance " heres what you need to know about each the collision damage waiver typically costs between &# and &# a day it provides that the company wont hold you accountable for theft of the rental car damages to that car or loss of use you may not need it if youre covered by your credit card company most visa cards have their own collision damage waiver mastercard american express and discover also offer protection especially on platinum or other specialty cards note that there may be a time limit on coverage the visa waiver for instance doesnt apply to rentals of days or more in your country of residence or of more than days abroad if you have collision and comprehensive coverage under your regular auto insurance policy that may offer protection for longer periods of time geico for instance will cover up to a day rental but the payouts will typically be limited to the value of the car on the policy "if you only have coverage on a toyota it wont cover you for a lamborghini " says loretta worters a vice president at the insurance information institute the supplemental liability insurance offered by rental companies typically has a price range of &# to &# a day and will pay up to &# million for damages to people or property outside the car that augments the more limited liability coverage that is typically included in any rental usually the minimum coverage required by the state if you have assets to protect such as a home and savings youll probably want more than the minimal coverage credit cards generally cant help but an auto insurance policy with enough liability coverage should do the trick since policies vary and have so many exceptions experts recommend getting the details in writing from your credit card company and your auto insurer before you travel you might find that information yourself in the actual insurance policy or disclosure documents from your credit card company be sure to ask about coverage limits time restrictions "loss of use" charges and the countries that are covered says neil abrams an auto rental consultant in purchase n y your auto insurance policy may not cover you for collision or liability outside the u s or its territories and credit card companies will usually have a list of countries where the collision damage waiver isnt applicable visa for instance doesnt cover rentals in israel jamaica or ireland and american expresss premium protection which costs extra is void in all of those countries plus australia and new zealand "if youre going to be renting a car you cant assume anything " mr abrams says
