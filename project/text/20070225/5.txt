love &amp money thinking about long term care now with apologies to the beatles my wife amy and i have been asking ourselves a question recently will you still need me will you still feed me when im we both expect to be there for each other but what if we cant be what if one is gone or neither can care for the other its not the happiest thought for a sunday but an important one we all get old and the daily activities we take for granted in our youth are the luxuries we mourn in our twilight as ive written before one of our goals for was to explore long term care insurance weve finally completed that the process took longer than anticipated largely because long term care isnt the easiest insurance to understand but buying it also isnt the easiest decision to make when youre years old maybe its smarter to invest our money and build a larger nest egg for our old age and what happens if one day we cant afford the policy and have to drop it we would have wasted all those dollars on premium payments to dispense with the suspense amy and i bought a policy for each of us we did so because we recognize life is increasingly long and statistically theres a good chance either or both of us will require some sort of care in our later years and even though were relatively young for long term care buyers we want to be certain today that someone will still feed us when were old to be clear not everyone needs this insurance many people will ultimately qualify for medicaid others have more than enough money for their old age and are in effect self insured based on our current nest egg and saving rate amy and i will likely fall somewhere in the middle that makes us perfect candidates for a long term care policy we will be above the medicaid cap yet an extended need for long term care could consume so much of our savings that it would be difficult to afford the comforts we want in our later years and impossible to leave anything to our kids in the event we need to draw on it a long term care policy would make life markedly less stressful for the spouse who must handle the costs of care or live on what remains of our savings but it has taken a lot of tortured thinking and some disagreement to get to this point amy has worked in health care her entire career and routinely sees families struggle with end of life financial issues as i wrote recently shes now watching her family and her year old grandfather deal with this she looks at our lives and figures the need for long term care is not an "if" but a "when " so she has been eager from the get go to buy these policies but ive struggled for months with this i honestly didnt want long term care insurance its relatively expensive costing us about &# a year combined thats money we certainly have better uses for such as saving for our kids education fattening our nest egg or even a vacation the more we talked about it though the more it made sense in my state louisiana the average daily rate for long term care services is roughly &# about &# a year according to notaburden com this is a massmutual web site for insurance professionals not consumers but its a good place to gauge individual state costs with the way health care costs are rising by the time were were talking about an obscene amount of money our nest egg might be able to cover those costs but it could leave a surviving spouse hard pressed to afford much of a life for me though this is the most sobering question what happens if the money runs out and were both still breathing a lot of people will argue its stupid to buy long term care coverage at our age theyd argue we have so many years ahead of us before well need it years in which we could be setting aside money that would grow into a much bigger nest egg they might be right but insurance is an emotional buy youre buying peace of mind and here are the facts that shaped our emotions at least half of people over will require help with activities of daily living the costs of long term care are huge and growing faster than overall inflation nursing homes averaged &# a year in assisted living facilities &# in home care &# an hour even if those costs rise a mere annually youre talking nearly a quarter million dollars a year for care in years medicare covers very little long term care needs medicaid does but you generally must impoverish yourself not my idea of a retirement to relish finally long term care insurance is generally speaking a pass fail policy pre existing conditions pretty much make it impossible to get so while we could wait we risk ailments arising that prevent us from obtaining coverage later arguably im overly conservative still in the past year ive come to think of long term care insurance as possibly one of the smartest buys you can make when youre young you lock in substantial coverage for future expenses that are statistically likely to arise and you preserve your nest egg for other needs or wants the policies amy and i have provide &# a day in benefits for an unlimited number of years and those benefits compound at annually to help keep pace with some of the inflation that will occur over the next to years well spend between &# and &# for policies likely to provide many times that amount in coverage yes we risk never needing the policies meaning we will have spent all that money for nothing but thats what insurance is our house may never burn down but that doesnt mean we dont spend money on a homeowners policy to keep our premiums relatively affordable we opted for a long elimination period the equivalent of a high deductible basically we have to pay for the entire first year of care most policies kick in after to days that saved us more than a thousand dollars a year in premiums our rationale these policies are for catastrophic care a nest egg should in part cover some of the ailments of aging long term care insurance should kick in when costs threaten to spiral beyond your means all told we keep our premiums down we maximize our coverage and were guaranteed that someone will still feed us when were jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at
