eyes on the road california goes to war against auto makers flurry of litigation over efforts to reduce the environmental impact of cars trucks online edition when it comes to automobiles california isnt just another state its something close to a sovereign nation a nation currently at war with a fair chunk of the auto industry californias recent efforts to regulate carbon dioxide emissions as a pollutant and to mandate reductions of co emissions including gases coming out of vehicle tailpipes has provoked a flurry of litigation with big auto makers the car companies contend californias efforts to clamp down on co amount to an effort to regulate fuel economy and states have no right to supersede federal fuel efficiency laws the state has countered that car makers by persisting in selling gas guzzlers to californians are creating a public nuisance by contributing to the ill effects caused by global warming including rising sea levels that could threaten californias miles of coastline and dwindling mountain snows that could undermine the states water supply read the complaint into this fight comes now california attorney general edmund g brown yes that jerry brown the former california governor who ran for president three times and more recently was mayor of oakland mr brown inherited the litigation with the auto industry when he took his current office in january some have called on mr brown to quit the states legal fight with the auto industry but mr brown has chosen a different tack he has called on the chief executives of the six biggest auto makers in the u s market to meet with him to find "cooperative approaches" to the global warming issue read his letter so far the auto makers have declined through their attorney to schedule a ceo summit instead they have offered to send "legal representatives" to brief mr brown on the industrys "multi faceted efforts to improve fuel efficiency " so what does jerry brown really want in a telephone interview the attorney general says his real goal is to help the car companies "this is not a problem that is going to be swept under the rug " he says "it is getting intense scrutiny even a year ago people would not expect we would be as far into this issue as we are " but now he says democrats control both houses of congress and the new congressional leadership including california democrat and house speaker nancy pelosi has indicated it plans to take global warming concerns seriously a leading republican presidential contender arizona sen john mccain has advocated tougher measures to curb greenhouse gases "some of these auto makers would want a practical interlocutor" to deal with the political pressures mr brown says as a democratic party leader he says "i am offering myself for that role " the problem of course is what can the car makers do mr browns proposal is that the auto makers "put their best scientists to work and come up with alternatives the auto companies invented the heavier cars the greater emitting cars they have a corresponding responsibility to compensate and correct for the damage they have unloosed in california " mr brown says hes open to the idea of subsidies to help car makers finance new technology that on its own cant compete with traditional internal combustion engine systems from the vantage point of sacramento mr brown says he knows that detroits auto makers are in tough shape financially "some companies are better positioned to deal with these greenhouse emissions than others " he says "thats a problem " mr brown also remembers that when he was governor the auto makers fought seat belts and he says electric cars once mandated under california law "died because the car companies wanted them to die " industry executives counter that electric cars died because they were exorbitantly expensive and the vast majority of consumers had no interest in buying them preferring instead the larger heavier vehicles mr brown is denouncing but mr browns point is that the auto industry has a long history of insisting that it cannot profitably build cleaner safer cars only to be shown up when such advances turn out to be both possible and profitable in todays political environment the industrys reflexive response to californias latest effort to push advanced technology "scorched earth sue everywhere endless attorneys for endless litigation is counter productive " he says mr brown and the car makers agree on this much litigation is counter productive "the reality is these issues simply cannot rationally be addressed through a tort lawsuit seeking damages against businesses for making essential lawful and comprehensively regulated products that play such a crucial role in californias economy and culture " theodore j boutrous jr wrote to mr brown in a feb letter read the letter to a significant degree the dispute between california and the car makers is a culture clash california has a long history of using its special status as the nations biggest car market to press for risk taking on advanced technology this is what youd expect from a state whose economy is based to a great degree on nimble high tech entrepreneurship auto makers by contrast are stuck with a business that involves sinking enormous chunks of capital into machinery and factories staffed by thousands of workers whose labors will yield a return only after several years those returns will come only if the car makers havent misjudged while planning their vehicles three to five years earlier consumer tastes or the price of oil the risks inherent in auto making breed a certain conservatism all the more so given the inconsistent track record of various on board gadgetry the other problem is that car makers dont create co emissions by driving cars people do mr brown who says his last car was a mercury sable purchased in concedes that changing californians motoring habits wont be easy he says "car pools those seem to be difficult to encourage there are ways of encouraging public transit not all that successful there are ways of encouraging urban in fill also very challenging in comparison to sprawl i get it that this is not easy " he says "but what some of the executives may be missing is to the extent global warming is real they will be forced into accommodating the popular will they sooner they get creative the better " send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
