alando tucker is a player of the year candidate but its the osu teenager who leads the league in assist to turnover ratio assists and steals afterwards the crowd rushed the court and mr conley was mobbed "he said there were people all around him " tom archdeacon writes in the dayton daily news "he couldnt see his teammates he could barely move " the victory fulfills the first of a triad of goals set by mr matta before the season for his young recruits the other two are the conference tournament title and the national title "this wasnt spin " andy katz writes on espn com "it wasnt some sort of fantasy it was in this fluid era of college hoops a distinct possibility for a talented group of freshmen " the loss capped an up and down week for the badgers who began it holding the ap no ranking for the first time in school history then lost twice still the badgers proved themselves tournament tough on the road michael hunt writes in the milwaukee journal sentinel but sportslines gregg doyel was unimpressed by the physical play and low scoring between the two teams that were nominally nos and in the country "if the best team this season has to offer was at the schottenstein

phenom and likely top two nba draft pick kevin durant has led texas to five straight wins including a victory over oklahoma saturday in which he scored points on just field goal attempts oklahoman columnist berry tramel considers where mr durant ranks among college basketballs luminaries concluding that hes one of the best freshmen ever though hes unlikely to match carmelo anthonys feat of carrying syracuse to a national title then again texas is third in the big and has games left against the two top teams it trails by a game texas a&amp m and kansas with so much attention heaped on where mr durant might be heading next year san antonio express news reporter jeff mcdonald provides a welcome look at where he came from most notably the tutelage of taras brown nearly every day for seven years "the program brown instituted made boot camp look like the macys parade " mr mcdonald writes "the first rule no pickup games in the world of taras brown pickup games were the devils workshop instead he devised an endless series of drills for the young durant to perform catch and shoot drills dribbling drills crab walks duck walks passing drills with a medicine ball defensive slide drills " a rung lower in the big kansas state is and overall under first year head coach bob huggins a major improvement from last years campaign and the wildcats first win season since next year teams should be much better thanks to the arrival of top recruit michael beasley "the kid is smart " jason whitlock writes in the kansas city star "you can see it in his play you can see it in his smile you can see it in his winning personality the best player to hit the state of kansas since danny manning has a chance to be the biggest thing to hit oz since dorothy toto and overalls " mr huggins is missed at cincinnati where he compiled a record his successor mick cronin has seen the bearcats lose straight games and just one of overall in the big east cincinnati enquirer columnist paul daugherty says many fans are blaming university president nancy zimpher for driving away mr huggins but a new set of documents casts mr hugginss departure in a new light "what it shows clearly is a coach who wasnt fired but left by mutual agreement a coach who agreed in may to serve the remaining two years of his deal and a coach who vacillated on that agreement all summer making unrealistic demands that zim &amp co would never approve " mr daugherty writes to the annals of awkward coaching ousters add the case of santa clara coach dick davey the broncos are tied for first place in the west coast conference with gonzaga yet mr davey was pushed out forcibly "retired" by the athletic department a few weeks ago after a troubling loss riled some alumni "why do people like this story so much because its a tale we see play out too often in life the powerful deciding they know best " ann killion writes in the san jose mercury news "the jettisoning of a loyal person who has worked long and hard to build something the capriciousness of the wealthy pursuing status and glory while failing to see what they already have " kentucky didnt trail for of minutes against vanderbilt yesterday but the commodores came from behind to win "in seven games this year decided by five or fewer points yesterday was uks fifth loss " john clay writes in the lexington herald leader "when teams win those close games the coaches get the credit when teams lose those close games the coach blames the players " indeed tubby smith attributed the late losses to his "personnel " but mr clay writes that
