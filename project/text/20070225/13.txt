when the time comes to tap home equity its a truism that for many people their home is their biggest investment of course when most people look at their house they see it first as a place to live a life maybe raise a family and fill with memories and thats the problem when it comes to retirement planning emotions often get in the way when we think about whether and when to tap the often large sums of money we have tied up in our homes of course living in a place that makes you happy is important but would be retirees should at least familiarize themselves with their options for getting at the equity in a home some of which dont require moving for bob and judy bartlett a square foot home on two acres in durham n c no longer made much sense after their two children had long since moved out meanwhile the retirees were spending more time at a second lakefront home so several years ago they began thinking about selling their primary house and buying something smaller but it wasnt easy to make the break the couple had called the durham property home for three decades and were unhappy about the prospect of moving away from close friends for many older adults walking away from a home is among the most difficult decisions in later life even when a move makes economic sense in a recent survey of retirees fidelity investments fidelity research institute found that didnt want to cash out the equity in their home because they wanted to live where they are "comfortable " an additional explicitly cited "sentimental" reasons "there are big emotional barriers to selling and those barriers appear to grow as you age " says guy patton who heads the fidelity group the fidelity research institute considered the outcomes from seven different strategies for a hypothetical year old couple who own a &# home and need to pull out cash the options included major steps like selling the home and buying a smaller house as well as less dramatic moves such as taking out a reverse mortgage fidelity calculated that the couple could pull anywhere from &# to &# out of their home over the remainder of their lives depending on the strategy the best option for generating the largest amount of immediate cash fidelity found was a dual approach of selling and moving to a smaller house and then taking out a reverse mortgage or home equity line of credit on the new home in fidelitys example the retirees were able to invest the profit of the house sale in an annuity and earn a higher return than if they took a reverse mortgage or a home equity line on the existing home of course some couples are reluctant to sell the family home because they want to leave the house to heirs fidelity found that for a couple more concerned with leaving their house as an inheritance it would make more sense to rent out their current home and rent a less expensive place to live fidelitys study is available at www fidelityresearchinstitute com for previous generations the only real choice when it came to tapping equity was to sell buy a cheaper home and save or invest the difference and there are still benefits to this strategy it raises cash but leaves room for tapping home equity again in the future on the newer house it also lets people retain an asset that could be passed on to heirs the negatives the emotional aspects of selling a beloved home and from a practical standpoint the potential difficulty of finding a less expensive home in the same area in the case of the bartletts they spent the better part of two years half heartedly looking at houses mainly outside the immediate durham area nothing seemed right says mr bartlett a year old former duke university professor "the fact that we didnt want to leave our friends could have in part been the reason we found nothing of interest " he says then last year they found a smaller house for sale in their price range just miles from their longtime home they snatched it up the bartletts were able to set aside some of the profit from the sale after paying off a home equity loan on the old house and also lowered their tax bills in the end the ability to stay in the durham area was important says mr bartlett but he adds "the emotional side was balanced out by the fact that we knew from an economic standpoint that we were going to come out ok " for people unwilling to sell reverse mortgages and home equity loans may be the answer reverse mortgages are a special type of loan taken against the equity built up in a house available only for those age and older reverse mortgages are growing in popularity because unlike a home equity loan the loan becomes due only when the last owner moves dies or sells the home however reverse mortgages typically carry fees higher than a traditional home equity loan and a home equity loan can be a better choice for people who want to pass the home to heirs fidelity says both options have appeal for those who arent ready to sell such as dave beyersdorf a year old retired truck driver when it came time to help with his daughters college bills he and his wife looked to their house but mr beyersdorf and his wife had built their michigan home in his wife designed it on land attached to a farm that has been in his family since the s selling the house was a possibility "but you have to understand i only live a quarter mile from where i was born " mr beyersdorf says the solution was a home equity loan in the end not only were they able to raise enough money to pay their daughters tuition they had some left over for her wedding of course all planning involves uncertainty and events sometimes beyond your control may require a backup plan donald rommel a year old metairie la resident had figured that his home of the past years could provide a financial cushion if he ever needed to supplement his retirement savings now mr rommel is unexpectedly out of a job because of an illness and is facing potentially big medical bills complicating the situation hurricane katrina his house wasnt damaged but in the aftermath he doesnt think he could sell his house for what he thinks its worth "i figured i wouldnt keep the house its just myself in a three bedroom house " mr rommel says "now im starting to think about a reverse mortgage " email encore wsj com
