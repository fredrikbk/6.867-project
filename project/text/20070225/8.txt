text of starbucks memo online edition from howard schultz sent wednesday february am pacific standard time to jim donald cc anne saunders dave pace dorothy kim gerry lopez jim alling ken lombard martin coles michael casey michelle gass paula boggs sandra taylor subject the commoditization of the starbucks experience as you prepare for the fy strategic planning process i want to share some of my thoughts with you over the past ten years in order to achieve the growth development and scale necessary to go from less than stores to stores and beyond we have had to make a series of decisions that in retrospect have lead to the watering down of the starbucks experience and what some might call the commoditization of our brand many of these decisions were probably right at the time and on their own merit would not have created the dilution of the experience but in this case the sum is much greater and unfortunately much more damaging than the individual pieces for example when we went to automatic espresso machines we solved a major problem in terms of speed of service and efficiency at the same time we overlooked the fact that we would remove much of the romance and theatre that was in play with the use of the la marzocca machines this specific decision became even more damaging when the height of the machines which are now in thousands of stores blocked the visual sight line the customer previously had to watch the drink being made and for the intimate experience with the barista this coupled with the need for fresh roasted coffee in every north america city and every international market moved us toward the decision and the need for flavor locked packaging again the right decision at the right time and once again i believe we overlooked the cause and the affect of flavor lock in our stores we achieved fresh roasted bagged coffee but at what cost the loss of aroma perhaps the most powerful non verbal signal we had in our stores the loss of our people scooping fresh coffee from the bins and grinding it fresh in front of the customer and once again stripping the store of tradition and our heritage then we moved to store design clearly we have had to streamline store design to gain efficiencies of scale and to make sure we had the roi on sales to investment ratios that would satisfy the financial side of our business however one of the results has been stores that no longer have the soul of the past and reflect a chain of stores vs the warm feeling of a neighborhood store some people even call our stores sterile cookie cutter no longer reflecting the passion our partners feel about our coffee in fact i am not sure people today even know we are roasting coffee you certainly cant get the message from being in our stores the merchandise more art than science is far removed from being the merchant that i believe we can be and certainly at a minimum should support the foundation of our coffee heritage some stores dont have coffee grinders french presses from bodum or even coffee filters now that i have provided you with a list of some of the underlying issues that i believe we need to solve let me say at the outset that we have all been part of these decisions i take full responsibility myself but we desperately need to look into the mirror and realize its time to get back to the core and make the changes necessary to evoke the heritage the tradition and the passion that we all have for the true starbucks experience while the current state of affairs for the most part is self induced that has lead to competitors of all kinds small and large coffee companies fast food operators and mom and pops to position themselves in a way that creates awareness trial and loyalty of people who previously have been starbucks customers this must be eradicated i have said for years that our success is not an entitlement and now its proving to be a reality lets be smarter about how we are spending our time money and resources lets get back to the core push for innovation and do the things necessary to once again differentiate starbucks from all others we source and buy the highest quality coffee we have built the most trusted brand in coffee in the world and we have an enormous responsibility to both the people who have come before us and the partners and their families who are relying on our stewardship finally i would like to acknowledge all that you do for starbucks without your passion and commitment we would not be where we are today onward return to main story
