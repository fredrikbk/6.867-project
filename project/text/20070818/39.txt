pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece what the pols should read trollopes phineas finn is still a politically savvy novel anatomy of a classic when asked by the associated press to name the last novel they had read many of our umpteen presidential candidates responded predictably with thrillers by the likes of grisham or patterson james or richard north sen john mccains choice of bedside reading was the most intriguing did hemingways "a farewell to arms" give him second thoughts about the war in iraq if it were up to me to assign the pols summer reading id put "phineas finn" at the head of thelist the second of anthony trollopes six "palliser" novels chronicling political life in victorian england "phineas finn" is the outstanding volume in an outstanding series and can be enjoyed independently of its companions weighing in at more than pages it cant be polished off during a quick flight from d c to des moines but englands greatest th century political novel is instructive and illuminating to this day trollope wrote phineas finn in and dickens was dying and george eliot was at work on "middlemarch " unlike his great contemporaries trollope had a keen and clear eyed appreciation of the political process and the money and factionalism that drove it were a source of dismay but not despair while dickens fulminated against politics and eliot philosophized about it trollope actually entered it standing for parliament in trollope called himself an "advanced conservative liberal" no more oxymoronic than the radical toryism of benjamin disraeli whom trollope opposed in "phineas finn" he described the nitty gritty of legislative gerrymandering long before the supreme court reviewed redistricting in texas trollope understood the allure of campaign finance reform but recognized the danger of opting out of the money game "while the thing remained it was better that the thing should contribute to the liberal than to the conservative strength of the house and if to the liberal how was this to be achieved but by the acceptance of such influence by some liberal candidate " "phineas finn" gives every side its say "the people can take care of themselves a great deal better than we can take care of them " says an mp who might as well represent a red state as ireland a political protester could be inveighing against our own patriot act when he insists on suing the government for unjust imprisonment and dismisses an adversary "he dont know what patriotism means i pays rates for the police to look after rogues not to haul folks about and lock em up for days and nights who is a doing what they has a legal right to do " the personalities in "phineas finn" are as up to date as the politics although the title character fights a duel and saves a mans life he is anything but heroic the cad woos four women during the course of the novel and deceives them all blame it on his youth at the outset of the novel finn is just the "impetuous irish boy" is elected to parliament in fewer than pages before he has won our vote or his character has been formed "men dont begin either very good or very bad " a barrister observes "they have generally good aspirations with infirm purposes or as we may say strong bodies with weak legs to carry them " the narrative drama and suspense in "phineas finn" lie in whether finn will ever acquire a sturdy set of pins and walk on his own two feet the novel describes a life that until very nearly the end is largely unexamined "there were many questions about himself " trollope writes of finn "which he usually answered by telling himself that it was his fate to walk over volcanoes " yet self questioning and self doubt are the surest proofs in trollopes view against vanity and fanaticism self examination distinguishes a statesman "ever doubting of himself " from a demagogue "it was not that he was insincere in all that he was daily saying but simply that he never thought about it " a century before the feminist movement declared that the personal is political trollope intertwined inextricably finns personal and political development as an mp as well as a lover he must acquire self knowledge and convictions this symmetry gives phineas finn an aesthetic unity missing from many of trollopes novels which are often padded with subplots that relate tenuously if at all to the central story this is no "loose baggy monster " in henry jamess famous formulation the twists and turns in finns love life mirror the maneuverings in parliament and forming a government is as tricky as making a marriage finns journey to self knowledge does not end happily the principles he eventually discovers compel him to honor his engagement to an insipid childhood sweetheart and to defy his political party by defending the rights of irish tenants in doing so he sacrifices his seat in parliament and marriage to a wealthy and beautiful widow but in condemning himself to a life of obscurity in ireland finn finally overcomes his inconstancy and achieves a kind of integrity however ineffectual trollope regretted his painful conclusion and killed off finns bride in a sequel "phineas redux " so that finn could come into a fortune enabling him to return to the political stage but doing the right rather than the expedient thing is often excruciating and virtue is seldom rewarded in politics as trollope knew all too well when he ran for parliament he declined to follow finns example and refused to bribe voters with money or beer they retaliated by handing him an ignominious defeat mr emerson is the author of "always magic in the air the bomp and brilliance of the brill building era" and co editor with john mollenkopf of "rethinking the urban agenda reinvigorating the liberal tradition in new york city and urban america "
