pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink a privilege of the privileged the demure old days of the upper crust are gone katharine hepburns "philadelphia story" portrayal of a socialite heiress allergic to publicity "of all the filthy ideas coming into a private house with a camera" was something of an anachronism even in but there was once a society ethos of quiet discretion articulated in gender specific terms by teddy roosevelts wife edith "a ladys name should appear in print only three times at her birth marriage and death " its a lesson that todays heiresses seem never to have learned but at least that venerable country club cocktail the southside has managed to maintain its aloof elegance cocktails like everything else in our current age of celebrity jostle for attention the creators of drinks and the liquor companies sponsoring them vie for bankable publicity with press releases blog blurbs tastings and all the other trappings of modern promotion not so the old southside a drink of subdued fame a tall cooling drink of gin lemon juice sugar mint and soda the southside has long been a particular privilege of the privileged class how did the drink come to be the property of new yorks country clubbers and the hunt club crowd of marylands baltimore county a few years ago nprs "day to day" featured an elaborately produced and wildly improbable segment on the history of the southside the drink came from chicago the story went notorious south side gangsters joe saltis and frankie mcerlane invented the cocktail to mask the taste of the dubious bootleg gin they were selling nonsense there is no evidence that the southside was ever served in prohibition chicago and saltis and mcerlane focused on strong arming saloons into selling their beer and their beer alone beyond such pesky details the story makes no sense why would a drink from louche chi town speakeasies find its way east to be embraced by lock jawed locust valleyites one might just as well imagine the astors inviting big jule over to shoot craps there have also been claims that the drink began at jack and charleys speakeasy in new york city later the "" club which is still known for its southsides but i suspect the drink had its origin on long island at a retreat so exclusive that few people even knew it existed the southside sportsmens club "its members as a rule are men of wealth and everything possible is done to make the appointments perfect in all that conduces to the pleasure and comfort of the members and their guests " mary orvis marbury noted in her book on fishing "favorite flies and their histories " the monied new yorkers who launched the southside sportsmens club had long been coming out to the wilds of long island to fish and hunt they would stay at the inn built by eliphalet "liff" snedecor his tavern was known for its excellent food but even more so for its mint juleps and champagne punch snedecors tavern started to get too famous and crowded for the tastes of its society patrons so in they bought the hotel with its restaurant and bar and turned it into the lodge of their newly formed southside sportsmens club some years later snedecors famous mint juleps still echoed in the cocktails served at liffs old place elizabeth foster a novelist and angler managed to visit the southside sportsmens club lodge in and found that mint predominated in the drinks not only were minty southsides on offer she wrote in town &amp country but there was "a drink called a collon special named after a former club bartender which is made like a manhattan with the addition of some chopped mint well shaken with plenty of ice it is a very refreshing drink for a hot day although fairly powerful " foster offered that "there is some doubt" as to whether the southside actually originated at the sportsmens club but i find myself convinced the men who fished and hunted at the southside did their golfing riding and racquet sports at places such as the rockaway hunting club the maidstone club and piping rock which explains how the cocktail spread to become the definitive summer drink of the country club set what was once the southside sportsmens club is now the connetquot river state park preserve gil bergen is the environmental manager for the park in the early s he was the superintendent of the old southside club where as he puts it "i first guided the old gentlemen fishing in " in those days the members drank no small number of their clubs eponymous cocktail "mint is an important part of the drink " mr bergen says as that is what distinguishes it from the tom collins when the cocktail book of londons savoy hotel was published in there was a recipe for the southside it called for the mint to be shaken with gin lemon juice sugar and ice battered by the ice inside the cocktail shaker the mint leaves give up a nice subtle hint of their flavor but over the years many country clubs have adopted a time intensive practice of letting the mint steep for days in lemon juice and sugar producing a mint infused southside "mix" that the clubs prepare in bulk to make the drink the greenish mix is poured over ice together with some club soda and the liquor of choice but what liquor though the southside was originally a gin cocktail at new yorks clubs the drink is more often made with vodka these days and has been for years when tom wolfe put a drink actually a lot of drinks into the hand of peter fallow the loutish but class conscious brit reporter in "the bonfire of the vanities " it was the vodka southside in baltimore the spirit of choice for southsides is rum picnic hampers of those going to the maryland hunt cup and other steeplechase races are usually loaded with ice southside mix and mount gay the rum ill allow but otherwise im a stickler for gin in my southsides thats the way "the old gentlemen" of the southside sportsmens club drank theirs and thats good enough for me email me at eric felten wsj com southside  oz gin  oz fresh lemon juice  oz simple syrup or tablespoon superfine sugar half a dozen fresh mint leaves club soda shake all but the soda vigorously with ice strain into an ice filled highball glass top with club soda give a quick stir and garnish with a sprig of mint for a more minty southside combine a cup of lemon juice with cup simple syrup and pack the mixture with fresh mint
