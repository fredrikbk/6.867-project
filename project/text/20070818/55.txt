the buzz marketwatch weekend investor subprime dance indymacs optimism will be put to test like many successful executives who have built a company virtually from scratch michael perry is a natural optimist as the mortgage industry has been pelted he has consistently said he believes his company indymac bancorp inc wont just be a survivor but eventually will thrive this past week writing on his companys blog www theimbreport com on the same day that rival thornburg mortgage inc issued a four day moratorium on locking in new loans mr perry went so far as to say that the "only issue" indymac faced was "how much business we temporarily have to cut out because there is no private mortgage secondary market right now " indymac he has argued for months has been unfairly lumped in with the subprime mess even though subprime loans those extended to borrowers with spotty credit make up only small part of its overall portfolio instead most of indymacs business is in the so called alt a space which is generally described as being somewhere between subprime and prime not that mr perry agrees with that description "thats true " he was quoted as saying in a company news release in march "but not very accurate given the facts let me give you a simple visual geographic analogy thats like saying that our headquarters in pasadena is in between los angeles and las vegas true enough but theres the question of degree pasadena is miles northeast of los angeles and las vegas is miles northeast of pasadena " geography lesson aside it is clear that mr perry is doing his best to distance himself from anything related to subprime which is understandable however as investors in all mortgage companies are painfully aware subprime is the least of anybodys worries the greater concern as the days go by is how the rapidly expanding mortgage crisis will affect a company like indymac which in addition to being second only to countrywide financial in size among independent mortgage lenders operates the countrys seventh largest savings and loan "based on an objective analysis of the facts " mr perry said in the same statement that contained the geography lesson "talk of the subprime contagion spreading to the alt a sector of the mortgage market is in our view overblown " overblown not according to bank of america securities analyst robert lacoursiere whose track record on the subject as of now is better than mr perrys in the spring of when the mortgage market was still firing on all cylinders mr lacoursiere downgraded indymac to a sell the lender had just beaten estimates with stronger than expected originations but with the stock hovering at a record high of around &# mr lacoursiere thought it was too expensive given what he believed would be "an impending cyclical downturn" in the mortgage industry since then as the mortgage industry has gone through something a bit more than a mere cyclical downturn causing indymacs stock to lose of its value as its financial performance has slumped as indymac has moved to adapt mr lacoursiere hasnt been impressed for example last month the company said it was laying off of its work force mr lacoursiere said that "signals managements realization that they wont be able to outgrow the problem " the company again showing its unabashed optimism has since said it is hiring about laid off executives from american home mortgage investment corp which has filed for bankruptcy protection mr lacoursiere feels so strongly about indymac that he headlined one of his reports "the basis for optimism is sheer terror " after one of oscar wildes most famous quotes then citing the lord henry character in "the picture of dorian gray " he added "we think indymacs optimism reflects their fear of what would occur otherwise making it a hope to avoid the negative outcome " mr perry though a spokesman declined to comment instead referring me to the companys blog time will tell whether his optimism was hope or hype herb greenberg senior columnist for marketwatch doesnt own stocks except his employers or sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds the wall street journal and marketwatch are owned by dow jones email hgreenberg marketwatch com
