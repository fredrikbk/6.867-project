the week ahead our take on coming events credit markets investor doubts put deals in jeopardy tribune faces hurdles in debt fueled buyout no better than by sarah ellison tribune co shareholders are scheduled to gather in chicagos downtown tribune tower on tuesday to vote on the complicated &# billion buyout for the newspaper and tv concern negotiated during the spring there is little doubt shareholders will endorse the deal the real question is with the credit markets badly hurting and newspaper revenues declining can tribune and its lenders complete the two stage debt fueled deal the stock market clearly has doubts tribune shares in recent days fell to nearly &# or below the &# shareholders stand to get on closing scheduled for just a couple of months from now lehman brothers said this past week that the likelihood of the deal closing "is no better than " a tribune spokeswoman said "our going private transaction is on track and the financing for it is fully committed we anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter " the deal has faced doubters since it was finalized april after a long tortuous auction that brought forward little interest in a purchase of the newspaper and tv empire chicago real estate magnate sam zell ended up striking a deal in which he makes a very limited financial commitment to support a buyout he has agreed to invest &# million the centerpiece of the deal is an employee share ownership plan that is taking on debt and can utilize tax breaks afforded esops to make repayment easier tribune completed the first part of the deal a tender offer for half the stock in may it ended up having to pay higher rates than anticipated in order to sell &# billion in loans to finance the offer and refinance existing debt to complete the second stage buying out remaining shares tribune is borrowing &# billion more while some analysts have wondered whether mr zell might back out his limited exposure may give him little reason to do so a person close to mr zell said "sams perspective on his investment in tribune hasnt changed he is a long term value investor and has an outlook that stretches well beyond a month or a quarter " if anyone wants to back out it may be tribunes lenders but a barclays capital analyst noted in a report last month that themerger agreement specifically excludeschanges in the "credit or financial markets" as a possible excuse for the deal to be pulled the agreements also make it difficult for either mr zell or the lenders to back out because of operating weakness at the company david hiller publisher of tribunes biggest newspaper the los angeles times said in july that second quarter cash flow declines at the paper of made the period "one of the worst quarters ever experienced " tribunes operating profit from its overall publishing operations which include the chicago tribune newsday and numerous other papers plunged in the quarter of course for one investor the chandler family until recently the biggest shareholder in tribune all this is moot the chandlers agitation is what led to the auction of the company last year but they didnt wait around for the second stage of the deal the chandlers have sold all their stock and so wont be voting at tuesdays shareholder meeting archstone smith sale if it actually happens may mark eras end by alex frangos yet another deal may be in trouble amid the brittle credit markets the planned sale of archstone smith trust a marquis name in real estate with more than high rent apartments to a joint venture of tishman speyer properties and lehman brothers holdings inc when shareholders vote tuesday they are expected to sign off on the deal in which the buyers have agreed to pay &# billion and assume &# billion in debt closing already has been postponed once and is now scheduled for oct but wall street will be closely watching to see if this deal crosses the finish line intact at a time when lenders are on the hook for more than &# billion in commitments on private equity deals over all in some ways the archstone smith buyout is one of the last of an exciting era when private firms picked off publicly traded real estate companies whose shares were trading below the value of their properties buyers in these deals typically invested little equity used huge amounts of debt and reduced their risk by flipping many of the properties indeed in the archstone smith deal tishman speyer put in only &# million in equity lehman and its financing partners bank of america and barclays capital put in &# billion of equity and so called bridge equity much of which they need to sell to investors lehman and its partners must also come up with &# billion in debt financing at a time when credit markets are having trouble swallowing real estate debt but unlike blackstone groups blockbuster takeout of equity office properties trust for &# billion tishman and lehman are buying to own rather than to flip they intend to keep most of the properties selling less than &# billion worth all that has wall street nervous archstone smiths stock closed at &# on friday up and below the &# a share buyout price indicating investors are wary that the deal will get done things looked different when the deal was announced in may shareholders complained then that the price at &# a share was too low as buildings were still trading at record prices but even then cracks were apparent in the debt markets as later disclosed in a government filing tishman and lehman in may privately lowered their offer price for archstone smith from as much as &# a share citing "adverse changes in the debt markets" as well as unforeseen tax costs the deal was scheduled to close by the end of august but as the credit crisis worsened lehman which is funding several other major leveraged buyouts including txu corp asked archstone smith for more time given how real estate stocks have sunk since may the buyout price now seems a steal nonetheless some say it might make more sense for the buyers to cancel the deal and pay as much as &# billion in termination fees to archstone smith rather than try to swallow all that debt another option to lower the price would require another shareholder vote after the vote attention will shift solely to the financing the end result will have major implications both for commercial real estate and wall streets deal making world "my gut feeling is theres a chance it gets done " says rich moore a real estate analyst at rbc capital markets "youre talking about a very high quality portfolio if you cant arrange financing for that youve got to wonder what you can finance " oil on the gulf coast helplessly awaiting the hurricane by ana campoy its late august in the oil belt which means
