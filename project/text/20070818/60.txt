the fed at a discount one rule of sound central banking is that if you fire your best weapon youd better hit the target so we can all hope that yesterdays federal reserve decision to cut its discount lending rate will restore some liquidity and confidence to shattered credit markets stocks rallied yesterday but the financial surprises arent over yet give chairman ben bernanke credit for creativity in threading the needle between doing nothing and throwing dollars at the problem the discount move is not the general easing of monetary policy that so many on wall street are still demanding it is also not a "bailout " the move is consistent with the feds appropriate role as lender of last resort and lending liberally in a crisis is sound central banking the reduction of basis points to from means the fed is cutting the "penalty rate" for such borrowing the fed also eased the terms for repayment to days though we are told that it will if anything tighten its collateral demands the goal is to coax financial institutions to borrow and thus begin to reliquify some of the capital markets that have seized up in the general panic over subprime mortgages and commercial paper using the feds borrowing window is usually a sign of financial weakness but the fed made a show yesterday of a conference call with banks that encouraged them to use the window as a sign of "strength " all of this suggests that the fed believes the credit turmoil is still not seeping into the larger economy the problem is a lack of liquidity especially in areas such as corporate and high yield markets that are otherwise untainted by the subprime meltdown if the feds move works it will ease the extreme risk aversion that has unhinged all financial markets of late with everyone afraid of anything except cash and treasuries one danger for the fed is that this is the kind of weapon that always looks better if you dont have to use it if you use it and it fails your credibility has taken a hit already too some on wall street and in highly leveraged positions are demanding the fed go further and cut the fed funds rate of they want to flood the entire economy with more dollars in effect to reflate the bubble but as weve been saying this carries its own risks of "moral hazard" and a loss of global confidence in the dollar by blinking on the discount rate the fed will encourage the easy money crowd to push even harder the discount move is also no substitute for the more difficult job of financial crisis management to hear some of the financial pundits tell it the fed is a magician that can wave its liquidity wand and all will be well again but the real estate bubble cant be revived the subprime assets are now worth much less than originally claimed someone has to absorb the losses and that means some hedge funds and companies are going to fail the most important job now for the fed the u s treasury and their global counterparts isnt to flood the zone with money it is to seek out and identify the specific financial problems handle them with care and then merge or liquidate them as needed in short to show the world that americas regulators are skillful and tough enough to let adam smith punish bad decisions without creating more systemic risk a hopeful backdrop is that before this credit market mayhem the global economy was strong the feds statement yesterday said that the credit woes "have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward " but this weeks economic statistics were nonetheless good for retail sales and industrial production u s exports also have been especially strong which will help offset the slump in housing that is likely to continue for some time lets hope yesterdays market rally was a show of faith in that underlying strength
