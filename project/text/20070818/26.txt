mortgage fraud is prime prosecutors hunt down scams amid foreclosures amid a jump in the number of foreclosures federal and state prosecutors have stepped up efforts to crack down on mortgage fraud the scrutiny by prosecutors comes as the housing industry undergoes a shakeout further exposing fraud schemes said to be as rampant as ever federal prosecutors in a number of jurisdictions including houston los angeles phoenix and new york have indicted dozens of mortgage industry professionals in recent months for their roles in a variety of alleged scams that were operating as recently as june the federal bureau of investigation has stepped up probes into mortgage fraud with cases under investigation compared with in and in the increased scrutiny stems in part from a flood of leads from banks the fbi received more than mortgage fraud reports totaling almost &# billion in losses last year up from nearly reports totaling &# million in losses in federal prosecutors obtained mortgage fraud convictions last year generating &# million in restitutions and &# million in fines an fbi report in may said "mortgage fraud is pervasive and growing " many of the schemes have been around for some time but continue to crop up despite increased awareness and scrutiny by lenders regulators and borrowers "were getting new cases faster than we can close out old ones " fbi spokesman stephen kodak said the increase in foreclosures was "providing criminals with the opportunity to defraud vulnerable homeowners " the fbi report said state prosecutors meanwhile are targeting an area of mortgage fraud known as "foreclosure rescue " there are different variations of foreclosure rescue but in general the scheme works like this rescue companies target homeowners facing foreclosure with what is termed as a temporary refinancing or sale the homeowner gets to remain in the home and make monthly payments until they get back on their feet but the new payments are often more than the mortgage was forcing the resident deeper into debt often they move out or get evicted and the new owner sells the home and pockets the equity the jump in foreclosures is helping to fuel the rescue scheme foreclosure filings were up in the first six months of this year compared with the year earlier period and on track to top two million homes for the year according to realtytrac inc an irvine calif company that compiles foreclosure data the number of homeowners who enter into foreclosure rescue deals is unknown but the national consumer law center an advocacy group for low income residents called the scheme a "new wave of fraud" affecting "thousands upon thousands" of homeowners this month a maryland man became the first in that state to be criminally prosecuted for a foreclosure rescue scam in june massachusetts became the first state to temporarily ban the rescue practice after a spike in foreclosures several states have passed measures in recent years designed to regulate foreclosure rescue operators state prosecutors in illinois massachusetts ohio and washington have filed civil suits against foreclosure rescue companies in recent months idaho attorney general lawrence wasden warned residents in june to be wary of foreclosure rescue deals "many of these schemes are designed to fail so that consumers lose their homes to the so called rescue company " he said ohio attorney general marc dann called the rescue scams "contemptible " after filing civil lawsuits against six rescue companies this month mr dann said "i can think of little that is more shameful or sleazy than attempting to profit from the misery and fear of homeowners who face foreclosure and are willing to do anything to grab on to any ray of hope that may enable them to keep their homes " massachusetts attorney general martha coakley sued individuals including three attorneys in march for their alleged roles in a foreclosure rescue ring the suit filed in state superior court in boston alleges fraud conspiracy and deceptive practices were used against several homeowners including steven thomas a church pastor who bought a home in december for &# and borrowed &# the same day for repairs less than a year later he was behind on his mortgage and facing foreclosure according to the attorney generals lawsuit leo desire a broker at primary mortgage resource inc of brockton mass offered to refinance the home and requested a &# deposit however mr desire later said refinancing wasnt an option according to the suit and suggested selling the home to a "trust" that would enable mr thomas to remain in the home then buy it back in six months mr thomas couldnt be reached to comment according to court documents he sold the home for &# in january but never received almost &# owed to him after fees and expenses were paid the home was never placed in a trust and went back into foreclosure after the new owner failed to make the mortgage payments according to the suit mr desire says
