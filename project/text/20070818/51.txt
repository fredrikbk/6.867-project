stocks soar as fed takes action to calm jittery markets currency carry trade becomes harder play amid aversion to risk as if many hedge funds and other global investors werent having a tough enough time during the market selloff now one of their favorite bets looks to be in jeopardy the "carry trade " this popular strategy where investors borrow money in countries with low interest rates such as japan to invest in assets in countries with higher rates has been a source of tremendous profits for currency speculators companies and even japanese small investors for years but the onset of a u s credit crisis has generated an aversion to riskier higher yielding assets that has caused speculators to reverse course buying back currencies they borrowed in before they get even more expensive the quandary now is that after many lucrative years with the carry trade there is no obvious strategy to take its place under the current market conditions "thats the problem " says john taylor chief investment officer at fx concepts a new york hedge fund that specializes in currencies and manages &# billion "were basically out of the carry trade now and it gets more complex and harder to make money " the biggest winner during the unwinding of the carry trade is likely to be the yen which at one point on thursday strengthened more than against the dollar would have been its biggest one day gain since had it held all those gains though the yen declined on friday the japanese currency surged against the dollar for the week and more than versus the australian dollar and versus the new zealand dollar but these moves are generally not welcome in japan where a stronger currency hurts exporters and could weigh on stocks the rapid unwinding of the carry trade in recent days strained the &# trillion a day foreign exchange market usually among the most liquid of any market even during crisis periods but on thursday and friday traders complained that trading even small yen orders became a challenge because buyers were overwhelming sellers some traders said the prices offered them looked so odd they suspected that some banks werent really prepared to trade the currency at all "they just dont want to make prices " one trader said "they dont know where prices are " earlier this year mr taylor said his firm borrowed money in yen at near zero rates and invested that money in new zealand dollars and australian dollars where those rates recently have been to since then the firm has been looking for another strategy as reliable it wont be easy goldman sachs said earlier this year that one basic version of the carry trade selling the six currencies with the lowest interest rates buying the six with the highest and resetting the mix once a month has returned annually since that made it both one of the most straightforward and profitable strategies over that period yet when interest rates move and market volatility accelerates traders can get crushed as they all head to the exits trying to reverse their bets at the same time once the yen begins to rally traders want to buy it back so they can close out their open loan positions before the yen gets even more expensive even so some investors are hoping that the unwinding of the carry trade is merely a short term reaction to the credit crunch and that it will return to fashion as it did after a violent unwinding in february and march and the spring of last year "i dont think that will happen now " says rodrigo guimaraes a barclays currency analyst in london he says that three conditions are usually necessary for the carry trade to thrive a funding currency with low interest rates low market volatility and plenty of trading liquidity mr guimaraes believes that japanese rates will remain low for some time but he thinks it may be a while before volatility eases and liquidity may not return to the abundant levels seen in recent years meanwhile he sees further unwinding of the trade in the days ahead "we think that long term investors such as corporates and japanese individuals are only just beginning to unwind their long carry positions " he said in a recent report while the dollar strengthened a bit on friday to from yen mr guimaraes sees it going to at least yen for now japanese currency authorities seem unperturbed by the yens surge encouraging traders to maintain their bullish outlook japans currency policy point man naoyuki shinohara said he was watching the market carefully but declined to comment on specific currency moves many traders took this as a sign that the ministry will not intervene to stop the yens rise soon sebastian moffett and amy chozick contributed to this article see related article "fridays markets cut in borrowing rate call with banks help dow back above " wsj aug
