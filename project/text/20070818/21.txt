the american petroleum institute minnesota rep jim oberstar the democratic chairman of the house transportation committee has called for a three year five cent a gallon increase michigan rep john dingell the democratic chairman of the house energy and commerce committee has proposed a cent a gallon increase but president bush two weeks ago voiced opposition to a gas tax increase and suggested that congress re evaluate spending priorities particularly the funding of pet projects in congressional districts congress has been considering how to improve the nations roads and how to achieve greater fuel efficiency meanwhile gas prices fell to an average of &# a gallon this past week the lowest yet this summer and down from the record high of &# a gallon set in may heres a closer look what share of transportation funding comes from the gas tax gas taxes remain the single largest funding source for the nations highways and roads and accounted for about of the &# billion spent on highways in according to the department of transportation other sources include tolls vehicle registration fees and bonds gas tax revenues go into the federal highway trust fund which was created in to finance projects and repairs for the interstate highway system and relies almost entirely on the gas tax since highway expenses are outpacing those revenues the fund is set to run out of money in soaring highway construction costs a result of booming overseas demand for asphalt steel and other construction materials and inflation have gradually reduced the purchasing power of the gas tax how much support is there for a gas tax increase a gas tax increase enjoys support from an unlikely coalition of road builders who favor more transportation funding and environmentalists and economists who believe a consumption tax would do a better job of getting consumers to buy fuel efficient cars and encouraging energy companies to develop alternate sources of energy former federal reserve

transportation bill two years ago that included more than earmarks worth &# billion in pet projects for chosen districts president ronald reagan vetoed a transportation bill because it had similar earmarks critics argue that more spending wouldnt necessarily have prevented recent infrastructure disasters minnesota for example received nearly &# million in earmarks in the bill but hadnt requested any money for the interstate w bridge that failed last month are there any alternatives to a gas tax more states are looking at private toll roads in a private partnership paid &# billion for the right to operate the mile chicago skyway for years charging motorists tolls indiana has leased its mile turnpike for years for &# billion a public private partnership is also behind the trans texas corridor which will add miles of utilities roads railroad tracks and truck only lanes over years nick timiraos points of view before we raise taxes which could affect economic growth i would strongly urge the congress to examine how they set priorities president george w bush the president is sticking his head in the sand the money to do the job isnt going to fall from the skies like manna from heaven rep jim oberstar d minn facts washington has the highest state gas tax at cents followed by pennsylvania and rhode island georgia has the lowest state tax at cents according to tax
