cross country warner warning arlington va virginia republican sen john warner seems to have made a political career out of proving the adage that timing is everything he married elizabeth taylor not long before running for senate in narrowly losing the gop primary he got the nomination anyway when the man who beat him died in a plane crash then he edged out a victory in the general election at a time when republicans were just coming up in the state now it would seem that mr warner a seasoned incumbent politician with strong military credentials is perfectly positioned to lead his party back to electoral victory in a state where its fortunes have been flagging and it has been hurt by an unpopular war but there is one just one problem mr warner is considering hanging it up and calling it a career mr warner came up in a time in virginia politics the s when the party just starting to make strides he is also an established military republican secretary of the navy under president richard nixon during the vietnam war he served in the u s marines during the korean war more recently he was chairman of the armed services committee and he is also turning against the war in iraq in january mr warner opposed the surge of troops and is now weighing how to stake out middle ground between democrats demands for withdrawal and republican support for the president the thinking in washington is that next to sen john mccain mr warner is the most influential senator on the war if he votes to defund on going military operations he would likely be followed be more than a few republicans its a position of influence mr warner must relish he was never really comfortable in a party with pat robertson and the late jerry falwell both his constituents as social conservative leaders hes a republican in the old style a country club republican not beloved by conservatives now with the war heading toward a september showdown when congress will have to authorize spending for the next year mr warner is becoming a key republican barometer if he goes other establishment republicans will find it much easier to abandon the president and if he does go mr warner will likely win praise for his leadership this is mr warners opportunity to show off his independent i e less republican credentials and in typical warner fashion hes doing his best to drag out his decision making process by not breaking from the president too early its been a rough stretch for virginia republicans in three of the four past major state wide races those for either senate or the governor the gop has lost all but one mr warners re election in in that span gop sen george allen a budding presidential hopeful was defeated and a bonafide democratic star former gov mark warner has been made its ironic that mr warner could be a savior for the virginia gop as historian frank atkinson notes in his book "virginia in the vanguard " he was estranged from the party in the s refusing to endorse two gop nominees for state wide office mike farris for lieutenant governor and oliver north for senate both men lost his turn back to the gop can be traced to when he beat back two tough challengers first he won the republican partys nomination in tough fight against james c miller iii in the general election it was warner vs warner as the incumbent senator ran against the man who would later go on to become a very popular governor the double near death experience pushed him back into the fold or was it that conservatives realized they had to tolerate him whats fascinating is that from a year perspective mr warner hasnt lost touch with virginia ideologically the two parties ebbed and flowed past him while hes continued to appeal to independent voters over the past four decades theyve traded dominance in state wide elections with one party or the other winning three or four major races in a row in this state each party has been able to hold the upper hand through the support of independent voters for about a decade at a time in the s independents started aligning with the gop in the s a slew of conservative democrats led by now former sen chuck robb wooed them back the s saw the republicans take advantage of the democrats moving slightly too far left to win four out of five major races now the democrats are on their own winning streak thanks to putting on a more practical governing face and a republican party thats lost touch with the independents national handicappers have missed this trend because the state has sided with the gop in presidential races but that is changing too democratic sen john kerry a candidate who would have been out of step with virginias electorate in the past lost the state by just eight points the joke ive used is that in virginia seceded from the confederacy and culturally thats true its now home to so many former northerners as well as transplants from the west southwest and new south that it is no longer a purely southern state that may be why mr warner never really fit in with the states gop and fits well with the state now hes not a real southerner he was born in washington d c that brings us to virginia is finally being recognized as a national battleground and mr warner is hinting that he wont run for re election but there is reason to think he will he is competitive enough not to want his seat to fall to a democrat and he may not want to retire if his departure sets his party up for an ideological primary fight between former gov james gilmore and the senators protege rep tom davis and then theres iraq one very keen observer of mr warner told me he thinks the old bull is getting so engaged in the debate over the war that he wont be able to pull away well know soon enough but mr warner has never been better situated for re election than he is now which is why the idea of his retirement has so many republicans nervous even as he flirts with the idea of breaking with the president on the war mr todd is political director
