pursuits culture theater a midsummer nights obsession shakespeare troupes abound despite slings and arrows puck sees a shark mill valley calif on a recent saturday afternoon a dozen actors and three musicians circled up in a grove of redwoods here just before their first performance of shakespeares "twelfth night " it was time for our directors preshow pep talk this time it was short susannah rose woods had been juggling a ridiculous workload in the previous six weeks doing everything from designing and sewing costumes to finding and arranging the flowers then a recently recruited set designer quit forcing five actors to strap on tools and carry out the construction in the final minutes ms woods was on a ladder with a glue gun affixing fake moss to a mock mansion for our southern setting of the play "ive never been so grateful to reach this moment " she sighed to her cast around the world thousands of people face similar travails as they tackle the bards greatest hits coping in the face of day jobs tiny budgets and no shows why do they do it to a fortunate few theres money and recognition in shakespeare but to most the benefits arent financial some take part because the plays teach the fundamental skills and logic of drama others hope to impress their friends and family or just like donning leotards strapping on swords and pretending to be somebody else my group the curtain theatre was conceived as a one weekend project in but evolved into an annual affair putting on a free show each summer the san francisco bay area has a glut of shakespeare companies and the curtain is one of the least prominent regularly getting confused with older better known groups in the well heeled suburbs of marin county the curtain has no offices no year round staff and no corporate sponsors we pass the hat after each show to fund a small travel stipend that rarely covers what the actors pay for bridge tolls gasoline and incidental expenses there is one special attraction a strikingly beautiful setting with a city owned stage in a park that is flanked by towering redwood trunks and encircled by a shallow creek each rehearsal there is like summer camp with a purpose turning the worlds most eloquent words into something that feels original our own there are other motivations for me my wife my collaborator in two music bands and a veteran of several shakespeare companies eight years ago dragged me into the curtains first production of "as you like it " to play the singing lord amiens where her theatrical adventures had often separated us suddenly there was a way they could bring us together after becoming the curtains music guy i learned how much musical choices can define a setting and differentiate one production from another leading a small band that usually includes my wife i sit with a guitar and noise making implements waiting to signal character entrances or make sound effects such as creating a cymbal roar to suggest a storm besides adapting folk tunes ive taken to composing original melodies for some of shakespeares songs and dances and even pen some lyrics using play deadlines to force me into creativity i rarely show in my folk or rock bands for the current troupe of actors one draw is ms woods a passionate leader who believes in rituals such as prerehearsal "walkabouts" that let players visualize emotional states and improvise encounters with each other but something more rare than devotion to a director happened last year through a combination of clever casting luck and the spell of "a midsummer nights dream " this particular group of people simply fell in love where curtain casts typically changed each year these young actors bonded so personally and artistically that ms woods was compelled to use most of them again for "twelfth night " none is more inspiring than chris libby a san francisco bartender who was a late addition to the cast last year as the rustic known as nick bottom by the end of our "midsummer" run as he added layer upon layer to the mock death of bottom playing pyramus he was scooping up rose petals from a prior scene and spitting them into the air to cough bogus blood even miscues are celebrated eric hoffman an educator by day who tumbled ranted and rapped his way through the part of puck during one of the final shows accidentally began calling up lines from a later part of the play trying to contain the damage he pointed up to the tall trees telling oberon something like "my fairy king attend and hark i think i see a shark " the image of flying sharks and the gleeful backstage reaction to it seemed to call for a song the one i wrote strictly for the casts consumption has this chorus "theyre not staying in the water like finny things they oughter theyre flying oer the land scaring every boy and man yes the sharks are in the trees " it isnt all fun i estimate we rehearsed about hours a week before the four weekend run of "twelfth night " which opened aug and ends aug my wife and i as part of the curtains ad hoc administration get involved in meetings and constant email and phone calls about all manner of logistics when ends dont meet i feel a moral obligation to reach into my own pocket this year ive already written the curtain a check for &# as did another director but the actors including a teacher a masseur and a hotel sales and marketing manager are equally committed more than some earlier curtain casts they dont dodge grunt work they come to rehearsals early stay late and find excuses to hang with each other when the show is over in an avocation marked by turnover can a group like this stay together it wont be easy practical or reasonable but i like to remember how bottom wearing an asss head responds when the fairy queen titania says she loves him "to say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays "
