pursuits travel the search for the next hot spot it may be the worlds best job testing beaches and scouting scenic locales how a little known cadre of tastemakers shapes tomorrows trendy destinations turning albania into the new costa rica for global travelers vietnam sao paulo and the caribbean island of vieques have emerged as hot spots a year from now there could be a new name on the list sarande a coastal town at the southern tip of albania it might sound unlikely its a five hour drive from the capital city most hotels there have fewer than a dozen rooms and nato soldiers still patrol the countrys border with kosovo sarandes shot at joining the ranks of travels trendy locales is the work of a little known but highly influential executive at crystal cruises named john stoll his title is director of land operations and his job is to scout out new and often obscure destinations albania he says has miles of shoreline on the ionian sea well preserved roman ruins and the cachet of being a place most americans have never visited some destinations of course are perennial favorites others like papua new guinea or zambia are visited by only a handful of the most intrepid globetrotters but a critical part of the travel business depends on the places in between those spots that have the potential to draw well heeled travelers but have yet to be developed specifically for the vacation set luck and market forces of course play a role in the rise or fall of a destination but in many cases their fortunes reflect the remarkable influence of a small cadre of people like mr stoll whose job it is to identify the next hot spot its the kind of employment many would covet crisscrossing the globe in search of unspoiled beaches great food and natural historic or cultural sites few tourists ever see mr stoll landed his job after a few decades of paying his dues in the travel industry he became a flight attendant right out of college raised in st louis as one of kids he says he inherited the travel bug from his father who worked for the railroads now hes held jobs at five cruise lines and titles ranging from "manager of passenger logistics" to "director of tour operations " w hotels relies on someone who has only been with the company four years to scout out new locations ross klein has spent most of his career in fashion as a marketing executive for ralph lauren and liz claiborne and early on as an executive trainee at burdines department stores he says his experience translates well at w which markets itself as a hip brand and has a big retail component everything inside is for sale from the sheets to the shower heads when talking about his travels he often uses words like "texture" to describe the feel of a place for inspiration mr klein picks up vintage travel magazines from the s and s at flea markets he looks for destinations that were once popular and today might have a retro appeal after reading a story about the bahamian island of eleuthera in an old town &amp country he floated the location at a brainstorming meeting while w has no firm plans yet to build there it does say outposts are coming soon to hoboken n j doha and moscow joachim schutte now a development director for shangri la hotels and resorts was once a chef and a waiter at his familys beer garden and restaurant outside dusseldorf germany scott woroch who helped bring the four seasons to malaysia studied political science in college and practiced law in washington and simon cooper who has spearheaded the opening of ritz carltons in moscow and bahrain used to sail yachts "its not really work at all " says adrian zecha of his job as the chief executive of amanresorts a singapore based hotel chain mr zecha was partly responsible for putting cambodia on the luxury travel map when he opened an outpost there in he spends two thirds of his time on the road often staying at his own hotels where rates routinely top &# a night or looking for new places to expand in a previous life mr zecha was a journalist and the founder of now defunct asia magazine at club med any new project in the western hemisphere needs the green light from nicolas boudet the paris born development director grew up in the middle east and north africa where his father was a food and beverage director at various hotels one of his most important resources is a year club med veteran named gerard joachim the year old mr joachim is the companys "marine consultant " he literally tests the waters at potential resort sites peeling down to his bathing suit and swimming or snorkeling in the ocean putting down stakes in a new place is a huge gamble for hotel companies building a room luxury property can cost &# million says michael sullivan a managing director with hvs capital which works with hotel companies on financing new projects resort hotels generally need to get about occupancy or more if theyre in an urban setting with high real estate prices to make a profit in many remote resort destinations particularly underdeveloped ones hotels often act as guarantors for the airlines sometimes paying &# million a year to ensure sufficient flights to the area some bets dont pay off a few years ago beirut started getting a lot of buzz for its booming night life and scenic beaches cruise lines started adding it to their mediterranean itineraries and in travel &amp leisure magazine named beirut one of the "worlds best cities " ahead of san francisco but when war broke out last july tourism came to a virtual standstill the cruise lines pulled out a new four seasons opening was delayed until at the earliest such risks are why some hotels say they prefer to play it safe the waldorf astoria brand recently launched by hilton as a chain of luxury hotels only plans to open new properties in proven markets like paris and london being the first to discover a new spot however can reap big rewards besides tax breaks and other government incentives hotels can claim the best site before the masses come rushing in it also helps attract well traveled customers looking for something new bruce schobel an actuary from new york says he rarely vacations in the same place twice recently hes visited vietnam and iceland his goal to join the travelers century club a group of world travelers who have each visited more than countries a few months ago he heard that united airlines had added direct flights from washington dulles to kuwait "i thought wow kuwait " he says "ive never been there before but that would be really cool " hotels and cruise lines across the globe are stepping up their hunts the four seasons keeps three separate lists of contenders depending on how likely they are to be built the "a priority" list for example has places that are most likely to go forward right now ho chi minh city is on that list after "b priority" comes "c priority " which now includes zanzibar as a hopeful shangri la says in developing its pipeline it keeps close tabs on the chinese with millions of chinese citizens now holding passports they might be setting the agenda for where travelers world wide will go in the years to come ritz carltons decision to build in the former soviet republic of kazakhstan offers insight into how the whole process works mostly known in the u s for its role as the birthplace of the fictional borat character kazakhstan might not seem like a good fit for the hotel company local culinary specialties there include horse sausage and sheep brain summers can be brutally hot winters extremely cold but to hear simon cooper tell it a trip to kazakhstan could be captivating complete with tours of historic cathedrals shopping for designer clothes and alpine skiing mr cooper is the year old chief operating officer for ritz carlton rather than focusing solely on the companys existing properties from his office in chevy chase md he says he needs to be at the forefront of building new ones plus he loves to travel about every other month he flies to relatively obscure at least to vacationers places to see firsthand the potential of an emerging destination mr cooper envisions the companys coming kazakhstan hotel which is now in a preconstruction phase catering primarily to business travelers but he says he hopes it will one day appeal to the leisure market too he says the country first popped up on the radar in ritz carltons development team in london was poring over european newspapers and looking through government statistics when they noted kazakhstans fast growing gross domestic product and booming oil industry around the same time he started planning a ritz carlton in moscow which finally opened its doors this july with a full time vodka sommelier a &# "czars breakfast" and rooms starting at around &# a night the developers who financed it were from kazakhstan and made a pitch to ritz carlton and marriott that the countrys business capital of almaty a center for much of its economic boom made it ripe territory for something similar mr cooper says the relationship with a reliable group of locals as development partners was crucial most big hotel brands act as management companies for hotels that are owned by third party developers and investors he put the country on ritz carltons list of "opportunistic" destinations at any given time this list includes roughly two dozen places the company is keeping an eye on for potential development including right now the seychelles and madagascar another "strategic" list comprises places that are more obvious like cairo and rome but that dont have a ritz carlton yet the majority of the destinations that make it onto this list end up being developed but it can sometimes take many years there were doubters when the idea of building a five star hotel in a country with a name most travelers could barely pronounce first came up mr cooper says out of the well traveled development staff of including ritz carlton staffers and employees of parent company marriott only two or three had been to the country "ill be honest initially we didnt think of it as ritz carlton " says mr cooper "but then there would have been skepticism seven years ago with doha and now youve got an incredibly robust portfolio of luxury brands and our competitors there " earlier this year mr cooper says he learned that the architect robert a m stern was redoing a dilapidated ski resort near almaty this he says was a good sign that the countrys developments were moving in the right direction in june mr cooper traveled to almaty and to the capital astana one afternoon mr cooper rode into the mountains to check out chimbulak ski resort there he met with mr stern who had also designed ritz carltons in dallas and aspen and discussed the architect coming on board in kazakhstan on the same trip mr cooper says he noticed other promising signs during the flight out he met financial consultants sitting next to him newsstands sold the economist and the financial times driving into town from the airport he passed a mercedes dealership for an urban hotel like the one in kazakhstan a local population with rising wealth is a crucial customer base mr cooper says thats because nearly of a hotels food and beverage sales need to come from locals who pop in to drink fancy martinis and eat five course dinners
