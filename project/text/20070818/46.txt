pursuits sports golf journal the biggest clubs shrinking role who needs a yard blast tiger others move away from drivers the common thread in two of the three most recent majors tiger woods has won last weeks pga championship and the british open was how seldom he used his driver over holes of golf in those two events he employed the big stick only times and theres reason to think that in the years ahead this will be an increasingly successful strategy in professional golf under standard conditions mr woods is capable of pounding the ball to yards in the air with his driver depending on wind fairway conditions and roll he might gain a further to yards sometimes more but on certain courses such as the site of last weeks pga southern hills in tulsa okla with its many tapering fairways and doglegs it makes no strategic sense for him to hit the ball as far as he can it would for a pro who typically hits drives close to the pga tour average of yards but not for mr woods so instead he plays for position off the tee with three woods and irons it is interesting to contrast mr woodss strategy at southern hills to that of john daly one of the few players able to hit drives comparable distances mr daly famous for his grip it and rip it style deployed his driver with impunity he lofted balls high over doglegs and attempted to reach the green of the shortest but penal par fours in the first round it worked on the th hole for instance he drove the ball yards into a pencil neck of fairway and birdied on his way to a stellar but no one expected him to match that driving accuracy four days in a row and he didnt he finished in a tie for nd place shots behind mr woods the comparison is imperfect since mr daly is nowhere near the overall golfer mr woods is especially given mr dalys recent doldrums but it does neatly showcase mr woodss strategic brilliance and points to a future in which for the tours big bombers the driver may be only a specialty club almost certainly going forward there will be many many more pros on tour with tiger like length gary player told me recently that he thinks plus yard drives will be common for pros of the next generation "what happens when athletes on the order of shaquille oneal and michael jordan start taking up golf at a young age instead of football or basketball " he said "theres big money in this game now athletes can have a longer career in golf who knows how far theyll be hitting it " already college coaches say its getting harder to pick out the best high school players because almost all of the good candidates are strong athletic and well coached and can easily boom plus yard drives formerly they simply selected the longest hitters figuring they could work with them on the rest of their skills now they have to look deeper to some extent yard drives are already here the tour so far this year has recorded drives that went farther than that the longest a belt of yards by brett wetterich at the mercedes championship in hawaii most of those drives were wind and elevation aided but according to several swing teachers and club experts i contacted routine drives in standard conditions approaching yards are a possibility according to custom club designer tom wishon mr woodss "controlled" driver clubhead speed is to miles per hour but when he really wants to crank it rarely in competition because he then has less control he can swing at to mph that creates an initial ball velocity of close to mph and a potential carry distance of yards or more plus roll some competitors at professional long driving events can swing even faster jason zubecks clubhead speed has been clocked at more than mph generating ball speed of mph and carries topping yards again in standard conditions but pro long drivers develop specialized swings for distance not consistency they have to connect with only one good drive in six attempts and usually use clubs that are slightly longer than allowed in competitions by u s golf association rules still mr wishon believes a tall strong limber superbly coordinated athlete with great technique could conceivably learn to generate clubhead speeds of mph or faster using a relatively normal swing and current tour legal equipment his drives might routinely carry to yards and roll out to the yard range but he warns "the faster you swing and the farther the ball flies the slimmer the margin for error " a ball hit one degree off line might still end up in the fairway at yards but at yards will probably be deep in the rough "the yard drive doesnt really match up with the golf game " says rick smith until recently phil mickelsons instructor not that long hitters wont always have an advantage he notes from yards for instance they might hit a five iron into a green while their short hitting peers have to go with a harder to control fairway wood "the courses the tour plays today are generally designed to reward drives in the to yard range " says rick martino director of instruction for the pga of america "hitting it longer doesnt make sense except maybe on a few holes per round " some of todays long hitters dont see it that way they would rather be closer to the green in the rough than farther away in the fairway but the powers that be are trying to discourage that style of play by setting up courses in more penal fashion especially for the majors and through recent proposed tweaks in equipment regulations and mr woods who can drive as far and at times as inaccurately as anyone seems to have determined that this so called bomb and gouge strategy doesnt win tournaments based on his track record majors and counting my guess is that the most talented of tomorrows young bombers will see it that way too email me at golfjournal wsj com
