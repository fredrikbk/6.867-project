placing bets using goldman sachs group inc s money he was one of goldmans highest paid employees turns out it wasnt enough internally dubbed "goldfinger" for running one of goldmans most profitable units mr mcgoldrick delivered a big chunk of the firms profits people familiar with the matter say he co founded and built the firms secretive "special situations group " goldmans elite but opaque money making machine that buys and sells eclectic assets including british power plants japanese golf courses and thai auto loans but the year old mr mcgoldrick decided he was working too hard on a certain path to burnout "years of constant travel around the world took a personal toll on mark even though the business was exciting " says lance west a former goldman partner who worked for mr mcgoldrick "finally it was about the money but it wasnt just about the money " mr mcgoldrick and some of the partners in his unit griped that they werent being rewarded as well as counterparts at hedge funds and private equity firms though highly paid his team was "under compensated " mr mcgoldrick complained to goldman colleagues he groused about being shut out of investments because of potential conflicts inside goldman then he quit now he is planning a hedge fund where he believes he can make more money with fewer restrictions the recent market tumult has mr mcgoldrick "chomping at the bit" to get back into the fray according to a person familiar with the situation he has told colleagues that the current credit crunch which has battered bond and stock markets presents new

traders who want to strike it rich mr mcgoldricks success illustrates goldmans willingness to risk its own capital to make unusual investments goldmans shares have fallen over the past two months amid an increasingly volatile stock market and worries over the firms risk taking trades three of the hedge funds it manages have seen the net value of their assets fall by several billion dollars so far this year the performance of goldmans special situations group will go a long way toward determining how well the firm weathers the current storm the special situations group manages more assets and operates differently than the goldman hedge funds hit in the recent market decline those funds are essentially "quant" funds which make thousands of trades daily based on computer driven models on the other hand the fund formerly run by mr mcgoldrick consists largely of illiquid often distressed assets such as real estate or corporate debt investments that may not pay off for a few years mr mcgoldricks departure shows that even top wall street investment banks no longer have a lock on key employees a few top traders at private equity firms and hedge funds earn as much as &# million a year with more autonomy his departure was so sensitive inside goldman that when mr mcgoldrick resigned in january the firm didnt send out an internal memo instead some executives hinted that mr mcgoldrick suffered a medical crisis partly to head off an exodus by goldmans other star employees according to people familiar with the situation "mark was such a legendary figure here that there was a lot of chatter when he left " says a goldman executive "people were curious or concerned " in recent months friends and colleagues of mr mcgoldrick have been calling to ask if he was in the words of one person "wheeled out" of the firm "the way the firm is spinning my disappearance is nonsense " mr mcgoldrick responded these people say a goldman spokesman says mr mcgoldrick left for "personal reasons " mr mcgoldrick who grew up near boston joined goldman from a canadian bank a decade ago he and the goldman partner who recruited him pete briger traded "distressed" mortgage debt amid the

deliver solid profit margins after the terrorist attacks the special situations group became a buyer of aircraft on the cheap from s to airbus jetliners mr mcgoldrick negotiated with travel operators falling behind on their aircraft leases banks dumping aircraft collateral of weak borrowers and owners who left their jets parked in the desert as the sector recovered mr mcgoldrick sold the planes earning several hundred million dollars for goldman in when mr briger joined fortress investment group llc an alternative asset manager mr mcgoldrick began frequently working hour days and traveling three weeks each month he typically would land in hong kong at p m and go home to work it would be noon in new york so hed participate in three hours of conference calls to review the credit and asset value of u s partnerships under consideration at a m hong kong time hed go to bed until a m when hed rise to review the units asian investments and markets by lunchtime he would turn his attention to his member staff in europe he then would be back on the phone with new york to review risks of the latest daily deal cycle to reduce his schedule mr mcgoldrick switched time zones by moving with his family to london a few years ago he began a push into alternative energy investments long before the sector got hot his group bought horizon wind energy based in houston for about &# million infused

receivables in korea when the government absolved card holders his unit bought an asian truck leasing business which performed poorly as markets recovered around the world in the past few years mr mcgoldrick snatched up assets he hoped would spike in value including office buildings and shopping centers in japan china india and the u s with this switch into more equity than debt he began bumping into goldmans other divisions specifically its equity units suddenly he had to contend with a variety of firm rules particularly goldmans lists on conflicts of interest for example hed turn in the name of a company he wanted to invest in which would be run through the "gray list" where goldman was working on a deal that hadnt been announced or the rt the "restricted trade" list where employees cant trade in a companys stock or use certain information in research reports because the firm is engaged in a transaction mr mcgoldrick bristled at the lists if one of his proposed trades spent days at goldmans headquarters for analysis hed move to another idea some goldman officials found his behavior as contrary to the firms culture of being a team player says one executive as he invested in more asset classes in more currencies and countries the special situations group grew "what started off as a specific group in asia focused on distressed debt grew like a weed " says a former goldman partner who left a few years ago "no one stopped mark and it grew to be of overall earnings " last year the unit contributed about &# billion says one person familiar with the situation a goldman spokesman says the firm wont discuss the units performance by mr mcgoldrick oversaw &# billion in proprietary investing that is making bets with goldmans money that year goldman chief executive officer lloyd blankfein asked mr mcgoldrick to brief the board on his highly profitable unit in the firms board room mr mcgoldrick went through a flip book and slide show of the businesss revenue return and growth say people who attended the meeting despite the firm wide recognition the star investor was growing increasingly frustrated by the firms bureaucracy when goldmans officials were slow to approve a potential investment mr mcgoldrick directly called david viniar goldmans chief financial officer he often demanded mr viniar clear investment ideas immediately claiming they were "time sensitive " says a goldman executive he wanted to sign "confidentiality agreements" with prospective targets within an hour in a bid to have access to deal information occasionally mr viniar relented more frequently he told his colleague to "go through the process " this person says still the special situations group cranked out profits a huge contributor to the bottom line mr mcgoldrick bought scores of bankrupt japanese golf courses for the past several years packaged them into one entity and sold it in an initial public offering in november for a one time gain of &# million in goldmans fourth quarter taking note of their competitors mr mcgoldrick and his partners began saying that the "paradigm" on wall street had changed executives at hedge funds and private equity firms were receiving of assets under management and of profits at goldman mr mcgoldrick and his subordinates hadnt been paid based on assets they managed and instead received less than of profits as drew to a close mr mcgoldrick argued that his group should receive a substantial boost in compensation by his calculations the special situations unit should get &# million representing of its assets and &# million or of the units profits for a total of &# billion "were going head to head with fortress cerberus blackstone " mr mcgoldrick told his bosses in new york referring to big hedge fund and private equity firms he wanted his team to be paid more closely to that formula around the same time mr mcgoldrick got sick frequently on the phone or on an airplane he developed severe bronchitis with a hacking cough he couldnt get through a phone call without throat lozenges for consecutive days a person familiar with the matter says he visited his doctor in london who ordered him to change his grueling lifestyle then the bonuses were distributed in early january goldman didnt come close to mr mcgoldricks figure of &# billion in bonuses for his group instead goldmans senior management awarded the group about &# million says a person familiar with the situation a goldman spokesman wouldnt comment on employee compensation mr mcgoldrick and several of his top deputies were outraged because he led such a profitable unit mr mcgoldrick was one of the highest paid executives at the firm with about &# million mr blankfein goldmans ceo received a pay package totaling more than &# million mr mcgoldrick believed they deserved more considering their groups profits when rivals such as fortress and blackstone went public this year their founders reaped financial bonanzas his team grumbled that their pay no longer was based on "market reality " most compelling to mr mcgoldrick his close friend fortress executive mr briger the man with whom he started the special situations group became an overnight billionaire worth &# billion earlier this year an exhausted and frustrated mr mcgoldrick traveled to new york to meet with goldman management because mr blankfein was away he saw gary cohn goldmans co president and mr viniar "ive run my race here its over " mr mcgoldrick told mr cohn says a person familiar with the situation "its time for a change " there wasnt a need to discuss compensation the latest bonus showed goldman wouldnt change that in a follow up meeting with mr viniar the goldman cfo told mr mcgoldrick the firm will "miss you very much " according to another person familiar with the conversation goldman didnt send out a memo announcing mr mcgoldricks departure nor did it immediately say who would take his place "all these rumors are flying around " maya ajmera director of the global fund for children says she told mr mcgoldrick she talks occasionally to goldman executives since the firm provides financial support to the charity the most bizarre rumor that mr mcgoldrick was at the same london hotel where a russian dissident was poisoned later goldman named richard ruzika as mr mcgoldricks replacement to serve as co head of the unit with steve mcguinness the units "book" of investments made under mr mcgoldricks leadership will last more than two years meaning that many stakes are longer term investments that wont be cashed out quickly this will give the unit a pipeline of deals to work from for now mr mcgoldrick is biding his time until his agreements with goldman not to compete or solicit clients expire in the next few months in the meantime hes begun running again and lost nearly pounds on his foot inch pound frame hes vacationing with his family at their horse farm in marthas vineyard and taking his oldest child to visit colleges still hes watching for investment opportunities and is expected to visit goldman soon seeking a waiver from the prohibitions of getting back into the business thats necessary because goldman has the hammer of holding a portion of mr mcgoldricks past compensation in the form of restricted stock former colleagues and other investors are already talking with him
