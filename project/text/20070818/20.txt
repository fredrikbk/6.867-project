hot topic of bridges and taxes some things in politics seem to be inevitable and one of them is that any road or bridge tragedy will be followed by an argument to raise the gasoline tax thats what is now happening in the wake of the terrible minnesota bridge collapse but that states transportation and tax record shows precisely why voters are skeptical the gas tax pleas are coming from the usual suspects in both washington and st paul james oberstar the minnesota democrat who runs the house transportation and infrastructure committee recently stood beside the wreckage and recommended an increase in the cent a gallon federal gas tax as a way to prevent future bridge collapses his wing man alaska republican and former transportation chairman don young agrees whole heartedly as it happens these are the same men who played the lead role in the &# billion federal highway bill thats the bill that diverted billions of dollars of gas tax money away from urgent road and bridge projects toward member earmarks for bike paths nature trails and inefficient urban transit systems in minnesota meanwhile politicians and editorial writers imply that the bridge collapse is somehow the fault of those like gop governor tim pawlenty who believe in the "motto" of no new taxes as a columnist for the minneapolis star tribune put it mr pawlenty has been skewered for his veto earlier this year of a cent a gallon gasoline tax increase from cents a gallon currently senator amy klobuchar a minnesota democrat has told her gopher state constituents that if president bush werent keeping us in iraq bridges wouldnt be falling down mr pawlenty has been wavering first saying after the collapse that he was open to a tax increase but more recently showing more reluctance democrats in the legislature are also demanding a sales tax hike to raise another &# billion whats never explained is why the gas tax revenue they already raise is so poorly spent minnesotas transportation auditors warned as long ago as that there was a "backlog of bridges that are classified as having structural deficiencies " in engineers declared that cracks found in the bridge that collapsed were "a major concern " bike paths were deemed a higher priority by congress however including its powerful minnesota representatives as recently as july mr oberstar sent out a press release boasting that he had "secured more than &# million in funding" for his state in a recent federal transportation and housing bill but &# million of that was dedicated to a commuter rail line &# for the "isanti bike walk trail " &# to bus services in duluth and &# for the mesabi academy of kidspeace in buhl none of it went for bridge repair minnesotas state budget is also hardly short of tax revenue the state spends &# billion a year twice what it did years ago the tax foundation reports that minnesota has the seventh highest personal income tax rates among all states the third highest corporate tax rates and the th highest taxes on workers the legislature started the year with a record &# billion budget surplus and the economy threw off another &# million of unexpected revenue where did all that money go not to roads and bridges the taxpayers league of minnesota says the politicians chose to pour those tax dollars into more spending for health care art centers sports stadiums and welfare benefits even transportation dollars arent scarce minnesota spends &# billion a year on transportation enough to build a new bridge over the mississippi river every four months but nearly &# billion of that has been diverted from road and bridge repair to the states light rail network that has a negligible impact on traffic congestion last year part of a sales tax revenue stream that is supposed to be dedicated for road and bridge construction was re routed to mass transit the minnesota department of economic development reports that only of the states commuters ride buses or rail to get to work but these projects get up to of the funding americans arent selfish or stingy and they can see for themselves that many of our roads need repair minnesota in particular is a state that has long prided itself on its "progressive" politics and a willingness to pay higher taxes for good government minnesotans already pay twice as much in taxes per capita than residents in new hampshire and texas states that havent had a major bridge collapse we suspect most voters would indeed be willing to pay more for better roads and bridges if they had any reason to believe that is where the money would be spent but they have long experience with politicians promising them that new taxes will go to such projects only to see it diverted for parochial ends a new survey usa poll finds that of minnesotans oppose higher gas taxes mr pawlenty can follow their advice or mr oberstars
