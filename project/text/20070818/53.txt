stronger steps fed offers banks loans to ease credit crisis the federal reserve took highly unusual steps friday to open up the supply of cash to the nations banks and signaled a willingness to cut interest rates if necessary at a time when some of the safest financial markets are seizing up and threatening the broader economic outlook specifically the central bank lowered the discount rate charged on direct fed loans to banks to from and took steps to encourage banks to borrow from what is known as its discount window such as lengthening the term of such loans to as long as days from the current one day fed officials also joined a conference call with leading financial executives aiming to ensure the feds moves have maximum impact by making clear that officials are actively inviting more borrowing from the fed the central bank has now used most of the tools at its disposal for restoring normalcy to the markets if these steps fail its only major weapon left is a cut in the federal funds rate target perhaps even on or before its next meeting on sept the futures market indicated traders expect the fed to cut rates at least a quarter point at its september and october meetings and down a full point from the current to by the end of the year "the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably " the central bank said in a statement before markets opened in the u s and after another day of drastic declines in asia and europe the fed said it would "act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets " the discount window was originally established as a way for the fed to lend to banks having difficulty raising funds elsewhere but this option is little used because it generally carries a stigma since it is seen as a struggling banks last resort officials are hoping their latest moves will encourage more borrowing injecting more liquidity into the system markets reacted euphorically to the fed intervention the dow jones industrial average soared more than points at the markets open then eased a bit to close at up points or but fed officials consider that widely watched benchmark a poor barometer of financial conditions and have focused more on the trading in debt securities such as commercial paper interest rate swaps and treasury bills and bonds which in recent days signaled deepening financial distress trading in those notes had become difficult because investors were seeking the safest most readily traded investments and dont want to let them go officials were relieved to see some signs of improvement friday but the gains were tentative and officials believe it could be some time before they know if their steps have worked amid a growing clamor from battered traders and money managers as well as some economists for central banks to go beyond their massive liquidity injections of the past week fed chairman ben bernanke continued to resist calls for an immediate interest rate cut but he showed some creativity and flexibility by altering the prices and policies surrounding the discount window top fed officials decided to lower the discount rate the interest charged on direct fed loans to banks during an emergency hour long videoconference thursday evening to encourage banks to borrow from this source the fed lengthened the term of such loans to as long as days from the usual one day then in a move reminiscent of the feds crisis management during the market meltdown prompted by woes at the long term capital management hedge fund a consortium of banks got together with fed officials to discuss the central banks plans at the request of the new york fed the clearing house payments co a year old bank owned group that operates much of the nations payment systems by clearing checks wire transfers and other forms of payments hosted a conference call at a m friday financial leaders such as as james dimon of j p morgan chase &amp co charles prince of citigroup inc kenneth lewis of bank of america corp lloyd blankfein of goldman sachs group inc talked with fed officials who explained their crisis response and subtly sought some help in boosting the impact of their action officials believe that getting banks to borrow from the window requires overcoming the reluctance of any individual bank to borrow for fear of showing weakness unless other banks do too the call was led by new york fed president tim geithner and fed vice chairman donald kohn and they emphasized they would see discount window borrowing as a sign of strength "the objective is to encourage a broad range of financial institutions to feel more comfortable providing term financing that will facilitate orderly functioning of funding and credit markets " mr geithner said according to a participant the steps he said will "help facilitate a collective response by financial institutions to these exceptional conditions officials believe that getting banks to borrow from the discount window requires overcoming the reluctance of any individual banks to do so for fear of showing weakness unless other banks borrow from it too so fed officials said they would regard participation as a sign of strength not weakness bank executives said the moves would likely bring some confidence to markets although they stopped short of saying they would follow the feds guidance and tap funds from the discount window that is particularly the case for banks that can borrow at more attractive rates elsewhere even in light of the reduced discount rate still the fed move does give banks access to cash they wouldnt otherwise have because the discount window will accept as collateral the mortgage related securities that have been shunned by creditors amid the turmoil lori appelbaum a bank analyst at goldman said access to the discount window could help specialty mortgage finance companies such countrywide financial corp on thursday countrywide drew down an &# billion credit line to bolster its short term finances "this is not a panacea in any way but i do think people will use the discount window in the coming days and weeks " said an executive who was on the call morgan stanley economist david greenlaw said that in theory banks could use the discount window to make relatively low risk loans such as jumbo mortgages as those over &# are known or purchases of commercial paper and be assured a profit for days moreover he noted that many investment dealers and finance companies have bank subsidiaries or affiliates that they may be able to use to access the discount window for example some investment dealers own industrial loan companies and countrywide owns a thrift all of which have access to the discount window for months fed officials believed the financial markets problems were generally limited to borrowers of subprime mortgages those issued to more risky homebuyers and firms and investors who held those mortgages but the credit crunch has spread as hedge funds banks and others from around the world reported unexpected exposure to defaulting subprime loans the breadth suddenness and opacity of this exposure have rattled investors and triggered a broadbased reluctance to lend to any but the most creditworthy borrower that skittishness spread first to the market for loans to heavily indebted companies such as those undergoing a leveraged buyout next it hit "jumbo" size mortgage borrowers and then some issuers of asset backed commercial paper short term corporate ious backed by other assets such as subprime mortgages which are often sold to money market funds while the fed acknowledged at its aug policy meeting that the risks to growth had grown it kept its principal concern on inflation a scramble for cash a few days later triggered by new revelations of subprime exposure sent short term rates spiking in europe and the u s prompting the european central bank and the fed to pump billions of dollars into overnight money markets through open market operations markets calmed down initially but this week the situation steadily worsened the commercial paper market a critical source of short term funding for an array of companies was becoming in accessible for a growing number of companies there were signs of trouble in parts of the currency market the announcement by countrywide the nations largest mortgage lender that it was facing funding difficulties also weighed on officials minds in the past week top fed officials have explored what other options they had to restore market confidence as they dusted off operating procedures for the discount window mr bernanke and others concluded they had a potentially powerful tool at their disposal the fed could lengthen the term of discount window loans accept virtually any collateral including unimpaired subprime loans and could set the rate at whatever level fed officials deemed necessary mr bernanke convened a videoconference of the federal open market committee comprising the feds governors in washington and presidents of its regional banks or their stand ins at a little after p m thursday after about an hour the panel agreed to the unprecedented step of releasing a statement with a revised assessment of the outlook such a statement has never been released outside a regular meeting except when rates were also changed officials knew one of the biggest risks facing their new strategy was that banks wouldnt borrow at the discount window in attempt to prevent that officials went on the offensive their formal announcement was released shortly before a m friday soon after mr geithner asked the clearing house payments company a year old bank owned group that operates much of the nations payment systems by clearing checks wire transfers and other forms of payments to organize the a m conference call mr bernanke wasnt on the call but mr geithner and fed vice chairman donald kohn were and they emphasized to participants they would see discount window borrowing as a sign of strength a number of executives countered that they could borrow more cheaply than at the fed window said people who participated in the call mr geithner made it clear the banks werent being told they must participate but should keep it in mind as an alternative when they are making judgments about credit the discount window can be particularly helpful to the nations smaller institutions which have less access to financing mechanisms than their larger brethren and are likely reining in their lending due to concerns about deteriorating credit markets although smaller firms didnt participate in the call a person familiar with the matter said the fed is reaching out to those institutions as well goldmans mr blankfein said he applauded the moves because accessing the window would not only provide liquidity that is extra buying power but more importantly would add more stability to the system participants in the call said they found it very productive according to someone who was briefed on the discussion and were especially gratified to be told by fed officials that there would be no negative ramifications to accessing the window even so the discount windows reach in the current crisis is limited by the fact that only banks can use it and they arent the ones facing the greatest strains fed officials categorically rejected suggestions by some analysts that they were acting on signs of distress among banks saying banks are in good shape rather the strains are being felt by nonbanks such as unregulated mortgage lenders issuers of commercial paper hedge funds and the market for securitized loans such as mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations still the fed hopes banks that take advantage of the discount windows easier loan terms will in turn be more willing in turn to finance the positions of others "its conceivable that the feds actions today could go a long way toward restoring liquidity to the markets " said mr greenlaw the morgan stanley economist yet the risk for the fed is that like its other steps so far it will prove too little and require even more aggressive action later its decision to acknowledge downside risks to growth on aug then its aggressive open market operations last week both briefly sent stocks soaring but the debt markets have only tightened since "theyre kind of running out of options " said j p morgan economist michael feroli "beyond this the only option thats going to give them a lot of traction is to cut rates " craig karmin joanna slater serena ng
