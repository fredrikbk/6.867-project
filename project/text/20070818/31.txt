pursuits books martyrdom without end the case was called a never ending wrong it still inspires wrong headedness sacco &amp vanzetti by bruce watson viking pages &# furious at the indictments of his fellow anarchists nicola sacco and bartolomeo vanzetti charged with the murder of a shoe factory paymaster and his guard in south braintree mass mario buda headed for new york city in september when he got there he obtained a horse and wagon and placed in it a large dynamite bomb filled with cast iron sash weights and equipped with a timer on a thursday morning he drove to the corner of wall and broad streets parked across the street from j p morgan and co and disappeared the noontime explosion killed people injured several hundred and caused millions of dollars in property damage his philosophical point made buda soon returned to italy beyond the reach of american law william j flynn director of the justice departments bureau of investigation blamed the wall street bombing on the galleanists militant followers of the deported anarchist leader luigi galleani "the same group of terrorists " he said that was responsible for coordinated bombings on june in washington and six other cities buda was indeed a galleanist and so were sacco and vanzetti paul avrich the eminent historian of anarchism wrote in his book "sacco and vanzetti the anarchist background " that it was "a virtual certainty" that sacco and vanzetti were involved along with buda in the bombings though their precise roles were unclear in his vivid smoothly written narrative of the sacco vanzetti case bruce watson concedes that sacco a skilled shoe worker and vanzetti a bookish fish peddler may have been "legally complicit" in the bomb conspiracy they were "gentle dreamers whose dream included armed rebellion " but mr watson does his best without quite succeeding to overcome his nagging doubts and persuade himself that both men were innocent in the april braintree murders when the gentle dreamers were first arrested it was not big news elsewhere "theres no story in it just a couple of wops in a jam " an editor of a socialist paper in new york decided but the case turned into a world wide cause celebre americas dreyfus case though they had been armed when arrested and lied extensively to the police sacco and vanzetti came to be seen by liberals and radicals as harmless philosophical anarchists railroaded because of anti immigrant prejudices and their own radical beliefs the prosecution had been corrupt it was said and the judge narrow minded even the president of harvard who headed a committee appointed by the governor to review the case supposedly betrayed the truth in the interest of the established order his committee upheld the verdicts against sacco and vanzetti and the governor denied clemency as the executions neared they took place on aug almost exactly years ago sympathizers flocked to boston to protest and when the executions were carried out mass demonstrations erupted in american cities and abroad the case "stabbed like a knife into the liberal conscience " historian arthur schlesinger jr later wrote many liberals their eyes opened to the apparent reality of class warfare moved leftward in the late s poets playwrights and novelists devoted works to the two anarchists though passions eventually cooled the legend of sacco and vanzettis martyrdom remained in the early s however revisionists such as francis russell the author of "tragedy in dedham" began to appear originally setting out to prove the two men innocent he wound up concluding that sacco was guilty vanzetti innocent he based his own verdict in part on ballistic evidence tying saccos gun to the bullet that killed the guard just as important however was the disclosure that the anarchist leader carlo tresca who had been like a guardian angel to sacco and vanzetti during their ordeal had told the writer max eastman and others that sacco was guilty and vanzetti wasnt that disclosure had been foreshadowed by another after the executions fred moore the anarchists first lawyer confided to novelist upton sinclair that he believed sacco to be guilty and vanzetti at the least to have had knowledge of the crimes twenty years after russells book was published further confirmation arrived in the form of a letter to russell from ideale gambera whose late father giovanni had been a close associate of sacco and vanzettis "everyone in the boston anarchist circle knew " ideale wrote "that sacco was guilty and that vanzetti was innocent as far as the actual participation in the killing but no one would ever break the code of silence even if it cost vanzettis life " finally even mario buda according to a friend of his interviewed by paul avrich said in of the braintree affair "sacco cera " that is sacco was there mr watson is not convinced he misreads the gambera letter mistaking the sons decision to disclose the secret for the fathers to cast doubt on its import and he discounts the confidences of tresca moore and buda by lumping the three men in with two erratic trial witnesses and three criminals who provided questionable confessions all eight he writes "changed their stories who to believe who to believe " its apparent that as a historian mr watson is no sherlock holmes but did sacco and vanzetti get a fair trial the philosopher sidney hook one of those in whom tresca confided the apparent truth of saccos guilt said in his autobiography that it still was "indisputable" that the two men were badly served by the american justice system but francis russell after his close study of the case found that despite "tenaciously held myth " the trial had been "reasonably fair relatively free from bias and prejudice " mr watson disagrees maintaining that sacco and vanzetti "clearly deserved" a second trial unlike his two comrades buda had no trial for he was never charged in the wall street bombing as avrich acknowledged in his book it "cannot be proved" that buda was the bomber because "documentary evidence is lacking " but he added "it fits what we know of him and his movements i have it moreover from a reliable source and believe it to be true " mr watson readily accepts budas guilt why then is he so reluctant to accept the cumulative evidence of saccos perhaps because to do so would make the story more complicated and less rousing a somber tale in which liberal illusion plays as large a part as liberal conscience mr landers is the author of "an honest writer the life and times of james t farrell" encounter see related letter "letters to the editor sacco and vanzetti perpetually on trial" wsj sept
