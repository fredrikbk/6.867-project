pursuits books five best oliver august former beijing bureau chief for the times of london finds these books to be reliable guides to china and its history  the bridegroom by ha jin pantheon ha jin is the master storyteller of modern china and this is his best book in the dozen stories collected in "the bridegroom " he portrays his homeland in exceptionally dark colors it is a place where anarchic privateering and lawlessness flourish below a surface of authoritarian control freebooters and corrupt officials inflict cruelties on the less fortunate who then turn on one another rather than banding together still ha jins view of his countrymen is intensely affectionate for three decades they have faced immense social change and yet even as their lives are repeatedly upended most people have responded with remarkable good grace an exception is the man in one of the stories who wants to poison an entire town after being freed from false arrest for the most part though ha jin traces the continuing toxic effects of the cultural revolution that began under mao zedong in the s when children informed on parents and even the most harmless comment could trigger persecution  please dont call me human by wang shuo hyperion wang shuo has claimed his own chinese fiction genre "hooligan literature " which revels in vulgarity and the rude contempt for authority shown by disaffected chinese youth in the novel "please dont call me human" translated by howard goldblatt he describes an alternative olympics in which nations compete for medals by humiliating themselves and their athletes the protagonist is a bicycle rickshaw driver and martial arts aficionado who is recruited as a wrestling competitor and then put through an ordeal that culminates in his castration but the plot is almost beside the point in this surreal tale it was written long before beijing won the right to stage the games but would be an excellent counterweight to next summers festivities  hermit of peking by hugh trevor roper knopf if proof were needed that foreigners in china can behave as dubiously as any chinese then british historian hugh trevor roper supplies the evidence with "hermit of peking " his investigation into the "hidden life" of sinologist sir edmund backhouse backhouse who lived in beijing helped shape western understanding of the inner workings of the chinese court when in he published "china under the empress dowager " but as trevor roper discovered backhouses depiction of the empress dowager cixi chinas de facto ruler at the turn of the last century was based on fabricated sources it is delicious to watch trevor ropers mounting incredulity over the fibs and and outright fantasy he uncovers including backhouses claim in his unpublished memoirs that he had affairs with both the empress dowager herself and oscar wilde  gods chinese son by jonathan spence norton historian jonathan spence has spent decades explaining how the middle kingdom got to where we find it today but none of his books captures the sheer madness of chinas past quite like the story of hong xiuquan a farmers son born in a hard up village near canton in southern china in after encountering western missionaries who gave him religious tracts he became convinced that he was gods second son jesus younger brother and had been sent to china to save it from unjust rulers he reinvented himself as the leader of the "god worshippers " and in fierce sermons he rallied armed followers to his cause they included bandits like "big head yang " a pirate queen from macao fleeing government forces hong named his troops more than the taiping heavenly army and led them north conquering territory with unexpected speed in he controlled an area bigger than france taking the city of nanjing he set up a christian capital or "earthly paradise " in as hong appeared close to toppling the qing dynasty he mysteriously died from poisoning and beijing reasserted its authority never again would it underestimate the potentially major effects of a single rogue  river town by peter hessler harpercollins peter hessler was on occasion called a "foreign devil" on the streets of fuling the town along the yangtse river where he taught english for two years as a peace corps volunteer in the mid s but in his fascinating and touching account of the experience he doesnt come across as very foreign much less a mephisto intent on leading his students astray he sketches the gentle rhythms of life along the yangtse under the shadow of the looming three gorges dam project with the sureness of someone who might have lived by the river all his life in a telling moment he asks his students what would happen if robin hood came to china today "a few followed the party line " claiming that in the economic paradise of the peoples republic robin hood would have nothing to do "but most of them kept robin hood busy stealing from corrupt cadres and greedy businessmen " mr hessler writes even in the upper valleys of the yangtse it seems chinese now prefer wanted men to party men mr august is the author of "inside the red mansion on the trail of chinas most wanted man " just published by houghton mifflin
