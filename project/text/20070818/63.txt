the new nuclear threat next week we will travel to moscow to mark the th anniversary of the nunn lugar cooperative threat reduction program a piece of legislation that has been the foundation of a decade and a half of u s russian cooperation to reduce and secure the soviet unions cold war era nuclear arsenal as the u s continues to adjust to a dangerous new era in which the greatest security threat is the possibility of a terrorist nuclear attack expanding and replicating this model of international partnership is essential to our national defense back in when we first proposed working with the russians to secure and reduce their weapons the skeptics were incredulous some detractors called it "aid to the soviet military " our response was clear and direct the nuclear threat was changing and our defense strategies had to change along with it as the curtain was falling on the cold war the possibility of an accident or a nuclear attack by a rogue state or terrorist group was rising the new nations of ukraine kazakhstan and belarus claimed possession of soviet nuclear weapons stationed on their soil one nuclear power was becoming four in russia nuclear warheads tons of nuclear biological and chemical materials and thousands of unemployed weapons scientists were scattered across time zones the closed society that had sheltered the soviet unions nuclear secrets had now been ripped wide open leaving an arsenal of the deadliest weapons on earth without adequate protection the premise of nunn lugar was simple the security of nuclear weapons and materials in the former soviet union was directly related to our own security and we could not act unilaterally we had to cooperate with the former soviet states russia saw cooperation as in its interest as well to ensure a secure nuclear stockpile to help meet arms control treaty obligations and to return soviet warheads to russian soil out of these new mutual interests a partnership was born we believe the partnerships results speak for themselves ukraine kazakhstan and belarus for a time the worlds third fourth and eighth largest nuclear powers have voluntarily given up their nuclear weapons in doing so they have set a powerful and courageous example for the rest of the world moreover today thousands of ex soviet weapons scientists are working in civilian jobs in addition to the weapons that have been secured nuclear warheads have been deactivated more than the combined arsenals of britain france and china along with hundreds of nuclear submarines missiles and bombers today russia is assuming more responsibility for sustaining the work we have done together contributing millions of dollars to major projects such as the elimination of its massive chemical weapons stockpile the nunn lugar program has been recognized especially in the wake of sept as one of the most essential elements in preventing terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction in light of the accumulated experience of years of successful joint work presidents bush and putin should expand nunn lugar and extend it outside the boundaries of the former soviet union to help other countries dispose of dangerous weapons and materials we have already begun in the american and russian governments working with the nuclear threat initiative a private u s organization spirited more than pounds of nuclear weapons grade material out of serbia since our two countries have been working together to remove stockpiles of highly enriched uranium from other unsecured facilities around the world many governments are now quietly inquiring about nunn lugar assistance with dangerous weapons issues through nunn lugar albania recently got u s help to destroy a secret cold war era stockpile of chemical weapons nunn lugar expertise could also be used in north korea should pyongyang agree to give up its nuclear weapons or in southeast asia if help is requested there to secure pathogens and viruses joint u s russian efforts would confer international legitimacy on these often sensitive missions by demonstrating that russians and americans are willing to work together and go anywhere in the world at any time to eliminate a threat the two sides can help avert new disasters and add a powerful international tool for keeping weapons of mass destruction out of terrorist hands the former soviet union was the starting point for this program but it must not be the endpoint terrorists seeking nuclear weapons or weapons material will not necessarily go to where there is the most material but to where the material is most vulnerable we must expand and extend the nunn lugar concept to help secure and eliminate dangerous weapons and materials wherever they are in the world mr lugar is a member of the senate foreign relations committee and mr nunn a former senator is co chairman and chief executive officer of the nuclear threat initiative
