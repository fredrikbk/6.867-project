pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations hatred begins at home whenever i think of war i think of this it was or i was in northern ireland and a local reporter was showing me around derry then a center of the protestant catholic conflict the neighborhood we were in was beat up poor with irish republican army graffiti on tired walls there were some scraggly kids on the street suddenly an armored british army vehicle slowly rounded the corner and the street came alive with kids pouring out of houses grabbing the heavy metal lids of garbage bins and smashing them against the pavement they made quite a racket a woman came out she was or her short hair standing up uncombed it was late afternoon but she was in an old robe and you could tell it was the robe she lived in she stood there and smirked as the soldiers went by shed come out to register her dislike for the brits and to show the children she approved of their protest as i watched this nothing sort of scene i thought thats where it comes from thats what keeps it alive i knew what kind of person she was she was lost neglectful she was what would come to be called dysfunctional and whichever of the kids were hers you could tell she wasnt giving them order or safety not often but here at this moment she was being responsive to something the presence of the enemy and she was showing an emotion hatred and i thought those kids banging the lids on the pavement they are going to wind up like her and for some utterly human reasons to get her notice and approval to ally themselves with her grievances if they cant have access to any other part of her at least they can have her resentment to be part of her world of any world they would grow up and assign their misery to outside forces the boy humiliated because hes never sent to school with a clean shirt will turn that into "britain get out of ireland " i know im being broad here but we often think it is large and abstract forces that drive history when it is personal forces too the headlines on todays paper whatever they are stock market decline bomb blast are in their essence personal stories somebody bought somebody sold somebody made the fuse people make history i remembered the woman in northern ireland this week while reading the new york city police departments report "radicalization in the west the homegrown threat " it is an interesting piece of work you can find the page report at the nypd web site nyc gov html nypd we associate terrorism with a threat from overseas but since terror plots have tended to be planned by homegrown terrorists these young men have tended to be "unremarkable" local residents who came to look to a radical form of islam for inspiration and meaning terror acts are preceded by a radicalization process in which young men are recruited to jihad the report traces the creation and development of terror cells throughout the west in america western europe and australia young recruits are often middle class and their interest is often sparked by an immediate or protracted crisis the loss of a job a change in family circumstances they do not necessarily come from anything particular lacking in the family but they have nothing to hold onto until this absolute thing this fundamentalist belief and its grievances comes by their rage is tended and encouraged by spiritual and operational leaders who offer a sense of community of belonging and of approval the report suggests an evolution in thinking "were very good at capturing these guys after a terror incident " john mclaughlin former deputy cia director told me "but in the past we havent spent as much time at the front end how do they get to be terrorists " he said terrorists "are changing their profile al qaeda knows what were looking for theyre not dumb " the terrorists of our future will likely be more credentialed and here legally they will be "integrated into american life " police commissioner ray kelly told me "i want a better understanding on the part of all law enforcement as to how radicalism takes place this report connects the dots " it is also meant to heighten awareness if the terror of the future is homegrown local eyes will see it first cofer black former director of the cias counterterrorism center told me that an important message of the report is similar to the signs on new york subways and in train stations "if you see something say something " mr black repeated one of the reports main warnings about the increased use of the internet in the radicalization of young men everyone knows about these sites but recruitment videos have become "more extreme " and their number has proliferated in only the past few years more and more they feature "hollywood techniques music heroic images to basically seize the imagination of isolated youths " all who follow american antiterrorism efforts closely wind up looking to what they call "the new york model " the city consistently seems more advanced than the feds in this area there are reasons new york is so good theyve already had a catastrophe which sharpens the mind they know theyre still and always a target new york has a lot of money a lot of cops a lot of capability and a citizenry with a heightened awareness because the city has a low crime rate it can shift resources part of the reason for new yorks effectiveness has also been solid leadership in the form of a popular mayor mike bloomberg and his police commissioner mr kelly mr black calls mr kelly "hard charging and no nonsense " so thats the latest report on young men and how they become drawn to terrorism its also the latest on what terror networks are up to and how theyre planning to move the only thing id add is that all modern young people come from two environments the first is the immediate family which is human and therefore by definition imperfect sometimes to a serious and destructive degree the other is the broader culture in which we all live and which includes everything from schools to the neighborhood to the media its not a new thing to say but its still true that the latter which is more powerful than ever is wholly devoted to the material people are money winners or luxury item enjoyers they just want stuff it is soulless the view we show of life to ourselves and to whatever lost young men are watching is not broad or inspiriting it is limited and dispiriting it is every man for himself we make it too easy for those who want to hate us to hate us we make ourselves look bad in our media which helps future jihadists think that they must by hating us be good they hit their figurative garbage bin lids on the ground and smirk and promise to make a racket and then more than a racket a boom
