to a daily fix near you soonest once it arrives itll dominate the rest of the month so before it gets here lets take a quick tour of sports odds and ends dont worry theres some college hoops in the mix first up how to sum up kansas state coach bob huggins the kansas city stars joe posnanski takes words to do that and winds up feeling like hes only captured some aspects of a complex man its a nice read by one of the fixs favorites though truth be told the motif of advice to young writers is a little baffling and no summary could capture all the twists and turns and entertaining tales told from mr huggins youth as a star high school player for a demanding coach who was also his dad to his legendary on court tirades to his missteps and his charity work "bob huggins is a lot of things " mr posnanski writes "hes tough to pin down hes modest and hes vain hes tough and hes caring hes blunt and hes indirect he says he doesnt read the papers and then he will quote your story back word for word he will call himself a dumb guy and never mention his masters degree in health education he will say he doesnt really care what people think about him and then tell you again word for word what other people think about him hes charitable and hes profane hes confident in his abilities and defensive beyond belief hes a defensive coach who usually recruits offensive players he always thinks a player can play harder and hes also said many times that the dumbest thing any basketball player can do is try to do too much hes one heck of a basketball coach thats one thing we know for sure " ron artest of the sacramento kings was arrested monday after a woman called from his home saying shed been assaulted and it turns out deputies have responded to five calls from mr artests house since last august including two domestic disturbances between the player and his wife oh and last month animal control officers took mr artests great dane because it wasnt being fed sadly such trouble doesnt make for a remarkable story in todays sports world what is remarkable says scott ostler of the san francisco chronicle is the kings reaction "the kings blew a golden opportunity to tap dance and obfuscate " he writes "they removed artest from the team picture the team did not announce its support for artest nor did any spokespeople say they would wait for the legal and judicial process to take its course before considering any action they sat artests arse on the bench and threw the bench out of the arena no weaseling waffling or wimping you can read the details in next months journal of the american medical association spine discovered in sports organization scientists believe it supports a moral structure " mr artests exit has meant a larger role for sophomore francisco garcia and ailene voisin of the sacramento bee writes that mr garcia has stepped up shedding many of the bad habits that hampered him as a rookie and earlier this season "after an impressive early stretch garcia assumed the role of the interested observer his teammates plodding and stagnating and struggling without him " ms voisin recalls "but this is where cisco has changed grew up while hardly anyone was watching though still the first king with a quip or to pull a prank he has become a serious diligent student of the game he has scrapped the tendency to launch a three the first time he touches the ball he has tempered his demeanor resisting the temptation to grab the pointer and like an overbearing schoolteacher acting as if he has all of the answers that look of disgust when someone fails to spot him in the corner the one that exposes his inner thoughts to virtually everyone inside arco gone the histrionics that so annoyed his teammates gone too " rick maese of the baltimore sun is following his first atlantic coast conference tournament and hes a bit confused why is he in tampa fla "id heard the stories from coaches players and fellow sportswriters for years and have looked forward to experiencing the event in person " he writes "the rich tradition the frenzied excitement the flip flops and sunscreen yep you read that right something funny happened when the tournament made the trek from tobacco road to the cigar city that little thing that made the event so special seems to have gotten lost stranded at a waffle house in georgia probably the most tradition rich conference tournament in the country managed to find a host city that has about as much hoops history as greenland " this being the age of the internet mr maese should expect a really boring call from someone connected to the tampa chamber of commerce oh right about now theres an unfamiliar emotion rearing its head in philadelphia hope "the flyers beat the first place devils tuesday night shook off that deathly first goal that new jersey thrives on shook off a deflating third period tying goal too and won the thing in overtime while a half filled building watched " writes sam donnellon in the philadelphia daily news "the sixers are on a late season roll and much easier on the eyes than when they had superstars the product now on the court resembles much closer the game you remember from back in the day before shoe companies ruled the earth the phillies was it only last june and the brett myers mess that you were convinced they would never ever get out of their own way their penny pinching with ryan howard aside how long has it been since you were this excited about them at this time of the year so now comes the question are you ready to drink the kool aid " equally astonishing the eagles arent mentioned until the second to last paragraph and then only as an aside doesnt that violate some kind of philadelphia law tiger woods plans to host an annual pga tour event in washington d c to raise money for his charitable foundation and pay tribute to the military around the fourth of july in the washington post thomas boswell discusses woods and his late father and the role earl woodss military career has played in his sons upbringing and career "unlike bobby jones jack nicklaus and byron nelson each of whom established well known invitationals woods is not associated with any particular town " mr boswell writes "he has been a world citizen since he won the masters in recent years he has been shown on his city block yacht or magnificent home over the ocean his image hardly resembles ohio jack or good ol arnie yet in a blink multicultural washington close to power lunch politics and world embassies but also near wounded soldiers at walter reed looks like a fit almost the only fit for the larger than life woods and his foundations long term ambitions " the prototype for modern hockey goalies isnt a player glimpsed through old black and white film its patrick roy the year old part owner and coach of the quebec ramparts last years major junior champions and the nhls all time leader in victories with "although roy was not the first to play a butterfly style glenn hall and tony esposito used it effectively throughout the s and s his size feet inches allowed him to drop to his knees and flare his pads toward the goalposts covering the lower portion of the net while using reflexes and handwork to try to cover the nets upper section " writes matt higgins in the new york times "if you take the stats of the time " mr roy tells the writer "it was probably or percent of the goals were scored on the ice and you were probably cutting down a lot of goals against just by going down on your knees " mr higgins explains how mr roy refined his style with the help of francois allaire who helped coach him with the montreal canadiens and how sports being conservative the butterfly style still has its detractors found a good column from the
