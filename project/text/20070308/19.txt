china tries longer term response to stock volatility shanghai share prices in china have bounced back from last weeks big drop but the roller coaster ride raises a bigger question whether beijing can tame the boom bust cycle that has defined chinas financial markets since their inception even as chinas economy has boomed its stock bond and futures markets have volatile histories each has experienced repeated bouts of speculation followed by a crash in past episodes including a chinese government bond futures debacle in a frenzy for mung beans in and a swing in copper contracts two years ago beijing responded defensively with bans on certain trading activity the reaction this time from within china as well as from the west appears to be that the answer lies less in stopping specific activity than in adding new financial products that risk adding more volatility in the short term but that in the long run might let steam out of a bubble before it gets big enough to burst this week treasury secretary henry paulson is in china dispensing advice that the key to secure financial system foundations is more openness and less regulation of capital markets "efficient developed capital markets will allocate resources more effectively and efficiently allowing china to continue growing at a healthy pace while spreading prosperity throughout the economy and giving chinese citizens a better return on their savings and investments " mr paulson said in prepared remarks for a speech today at the shanghai futures exchange he urged the chinese to quickly adopt certain market reforms including developing a more accessible and more liquid bond market a market for institutional investors strong accounting and governance standards and a less onerous regulatory structure mr paulson the former head of goldman sachs group inc also reiterated his view that "allowing much more foreign participation in chinas financial markets would speed reform " as well as bring "stability and prosperity " without these overhauls he said chinas growth will continue to be "imbalanced " and it wont be able to meet the "chinese peoples needs " such as funding education health care and retirement slowly chinese authorities appear to be adopting a similar message instead of recoiling in response to last weeks wake up call on stocks and the global downturn it triggered beijing said market corrections are normal after the stock rout premier wen jiabao reassured investors that the government remains committed to building credible financial markets and inviting foreign participation other officials said plans for introducing new stock based products remain on track the reason "we are an industrial giant but a capital markets dwarf this needs to change " says jin yanshi chief economist at xiangcai securities co in shanghai these attitudes could hearten washington that beijing is becoming more comfortable with the volatility inherent in financial markets in particular mr paulson wants china to build strong capital markets that could lay the groundwork for a market determined exchange rate market participants consider futures the next big thing for chinas financial sector development the exchange currently trades contracts in copper aluminum natural rubber and fuel oil commodities that china imports in large quantities but trading is largely closed to foreigners futures on financial products such as stock indexes and currencies dont yet exist in china though they are integral to other market economies china banned exchange traded financial derivatives in in response to a meltdown in its bond futures market within minutes &# billion in market value was wiped out in what remains the countrys most damaging market debacle to date by contrast last weeks drop in stocks has revived the case for financial futures officials now say share prices probably wouldnt have fallen so abruptly on feb if index futures existed thats because shares probably wouldnt have surged as quickly as they did last year the shanghai composite index rose if investors had had the chance to use stock index futures to bet against the market on its way up futures contracts are thought to build more of a two way market because they give investors the right to buy and sell based on expectations about how the value of an index stock currency or commodity might move within a particular time frame without them the only way for investors to make money is in a rising market a risky prospect over the long term after last weeks stock market volatility fan fuchun a vice chairman of the china securities regulatory commission told reporters that authorities hope to launch stock index futures in the first half of this year the products would be traded in the building where mr paulson is speaking on a newly formed china financial futures exchange which thus far has no products in his calls for more modern capital markets in china mr paulson is also clearly looking to deal with the battle over the countrys currency which many critics in washington say is kept artificially low by the chinese to gain an advantage in global trade many in congress are pushing mr paulson to bring home results and get beijing to relax its grip on the yuan while mr paulson did not mention the yuan or the debate over chinas currency in his speech people familiar with his thinking said his view is that adopting market overhauls will encourage china to pursue a more flexible yuan since the reforms will spur domestic consumption and make china less reliant on exports in his speech mr paulson said financial sector development will help china "transition into an economy that is less reliant on industrial activity produces more high value added products and reduces the intensity of natural resources consumption " yi xianrong a researcher with the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing says the risks in chinas markets are "even bigger than somewhere overseas" because the market infrastructure is lacking until a broad array of changes are made chinas financial system remains vulnerable to the boom bust cycle according to donald straszheim vice chairman of roth capital partners llc in los angeles "its all about risk and reward being properly aligned " he says but walter molano research director at bcp securities llc based in greenwich conn says that the u s also faced these risks when its markets began in china he says "the peaks and valleys are becoming less pronounced" as new products are unveiled regulations are tightened and the markets get bigger tang hanting contributed to this article
