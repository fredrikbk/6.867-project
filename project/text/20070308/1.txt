secret ballot is absolutely necessary in a largely party line vote last week democrats in the house passed the employee free choice act a measure that rewrites the rules for union organizing by eliminating secret ballot elections the senate is up next and if you suspect this has everything to do with expanding union membership and nada to do with "employee free choice " wed direct you to a missive sent to mexico in and signed by democrats in congress the letter is addressed to government officials and concerns "democracy in the mexican workplace " it reads "we are writing to encourage you to use the secret ballot in all union recognition elections " it continues "we understand that the secret ballot is allowed for but not required by mexican labor law however we feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose " five of the signers have since left congress the other voted last week for the employee free choice act and by the way the letters lead signatory is representative george miller of california who also happens to be the lead sponsor of the house bill which means the same person lecturing mexican officials on the primacy of secret ballot elections has been heading up the effort to end them for million u s workers big labors problem is not that americans arent free to organize but that more and more are choosing not to today just of the private sector workforce is unionized thats down from as recently as the s reversing this trend is a top union priority labor leaders made it clear to democrats that in return for political support in last years election they wanted a vote on legislation that would make organizing much easier house democrats have now delivered but dont let them fool you into thinking this has anything to do with "free choice "
