the evening wrap withdrawal symptoms online edition the president is expected to take plenty of heat from the left during his swing through hugo chavez country in coming days but political southpaws at home served up a parting punch by revealing a timetable for withdrawal from iraq just hours before president bush was scheduled to head off for a sweep through latin america house democrats unveiled legislation requiring the withdrawal of u s combat troops from iraq before the end of next year the proposal is the first time this congress has laid out a specific timetable for pulling soldiers out of iraq speaker nancy pelosi said the measure will be added to legislation providing roughly &# million in funding for the wars in afghanistan and iraq and that she hopes to have the package clear committee and be debated by the full house within weeks the democrats proposal ties the withdrawal to the meeting of certain benchmarks by the government of prime minister nouri al maliki mr bush would have to certify by july and then again by dec that iraq was achieving certain goals in improving security allocating oil resources and creating a fair process to amend the iraqi constitution if iraq failed to meet those standards by either deadline the withdrawal would be accelerated immediately pulling all u s troops out of the country in six months whatever the case "our troops are out by no later than august of " ms pelosi said the president has refused prior efforts to put a timetable on when troops will be brought home arguing that a firm set of dates would simply allow terrorists and insurgents to circle that date on their calendars go into hiding until u s forces clear out and emerge replenished to threaten the maliki regime dan bartlett a senior white house adviser traveling to latin america with mr bush said its "safe to say" that the bill is a "nonstarter with the president " john boehner the house minority leader quickly attacked it too saying "gen david petraeus should be the one making the decisions on what happens on the ground in iraq not nancy pelosi or john murtha " the measure is the product of considerable backroom politicking by ms pelosi and mr bartlett appeared to dismiss it as intraparty cat herding deeming it "a political compromise" aimed at "bringing comity" to the party he said the white house "would vehemently oppose and ultimately veto any legislation that looks like what was described today " meanwhile the administration signaled it may be open to direct talks with iran or syria over how to help stabilize iraq at a conference this weekend in addition to the withdrawal timetable the spending package carries a number of changes to mr bushs original request the legislation tacks &# billion on to the presidents

example perhaps most intriguingly the measure includes an increase in the federal minimum wage a minimum wage increase has been languishing in the senate amid bickering over whether the pay boost should include some tax breaks for small business ms pelosi is gambling that bundling the wage increase into the war bill will help keep liberal democrats at her side while also putting heat on the
