download their clip and are paid in cash via paypal accounts see me tv and several services like it in the u k and in asia are among the first to offer cellphone users the same kind of interactive self generated content that they are lapping up on their home or laptop computers these services are seen as the latest weapons in a broader turf war between internet companies and telecom operators as more people go online via their mobile phones a new market for ads will be created beyond just selling services phone companies want to grab a piece of that nascent ad market while companies like yahoo and google want to extend their web advertising dominance to cellphones in this evolving landscape the web companies and the telecoms are sometimes going it alone and sometimes joining forces

services make customers more loyal to which has million subscribers in the u k and networks in italy the netherlands austria sweden and ireland "if customers are engaging and interacting the chances are they will stay with us and not switch to one of our competitors " said mr oxby "that has an enormous economic benefit to our business " there are hurdles blogging and uploading content from mobile phones is still in its infancy and has been difficult for consumers to figure out leaving it the domain of cellphone aficionados also viewing internet pages from a phone can be tricky because formatting isnt the same and the screens are tiny and of course companies are still working out the business model but sanjiv ahuja chief executive of orange the subsidiary and brand of france telecom says customer demand is the real reason the operators have to create these services even if the business case is still taking shape "customers want this stuff we have to serve the customers " says mr

its customers even if they had a phone that was several years old assuring compatibility took more work upfront when designing the software but was key to a successful launch said s mr oxby the company also decided to let all customers access see me tv from their phones without paying any extra subscription fees or charges for downloading big data files "consumers are extremely price sensitive and dont want to be surprised when they get their bill at the end of the month " said david springall the chief technology officer for yospace "this stuff is considered throw away content you have to rely on volume not price to make the business model fly " yospace also developed and runs s look at me and is seeking contracts with others in europe and the u s because see me tvs content is user generated it requires a lot of adult supervision to ensure it doesnt cross lines of good taste or legality a dozen people at yospaces offices in london watch every video that is submitted and screen out those deemed too raunchy too boring or in violation of copyright some of videos submitted never make it onto see me tv "the moderation is a key part of the service " said mr springall adding that while users might spend minutes surfing on youtube to find a funny video they had a shorter attention span on a mobile phone "if the user cant find download and watch a clip in less than
