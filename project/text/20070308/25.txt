democracy by proxy for several months now the securities and exchange commission has been wringing its hands over whether to adopt a much hyped "shareholder access" rule this would make it easier for shareholders to use the corporate proxy process to elect dissident candidates to a companys board of directors activist investor groups including many hedge funds are pushing hard for the new rule they argue that greater shareholder access to the proxy machinery promotes "corporate democracy " the sec seems to be working just as hard to avoid making a decision sec chairman christopher cox has twice moved the matter off the agencys agenda recently he took the additional step of announcing that the sec needed to commission a study mr cox is right to drag his feet any time hedge funds start making speeches about rights and democracy average investors need to take firm grips on their wallets but the proposed rule poses a special threat to the average investor if passed it would dramatically accelerate an already dangerous trend the flight of corporations away from public investors and into the arms of "private equity " traditionally public shareholders have been portrayed in the media and in policy debates as helpless victims of managerial greed abused "owners" of corporations whose interests need protecting through regulation its not clear this portrait was ever accurate but its certainly not today for at least two reasons first thanks to a variety of developments over the past few decades from the rise of mutual funds to the proliferation of class action lawsuits to changes in the secs proxy rules to the passage of the sarbanes oxley act shareholders have more power and influence over corporate executives and directors today than at any time in the history of the american public corporation second and more important the notion of "shareholder as owner victim" ignores an awkward reality public shareholders are becoming less and less important to corporations corporate directors and executives are growing tired of public investors shrill often conflicting and apparently endless demands and many are finding they have an alternative instead of dealing with whiny public shareholders they can go to one of many rapidly growing private equity funds like kkr blackrock or carlyle group and raise the capital they need to buy the companys stock back from its shareholders voila a company once owned by the investing public is now owned by the private equity fund and the companys managers more and more firms are taking this road was a blockbuster year for corporate buyouts and may be even bigger private equity firms are the new stars of wall street earning to annual returns for their investors usually private foundations and wealthy individuals the ironic result seems to be lower returns for exactly the same average investor whom reformers calling for "shareholder access" say they want to protect small investors tend to own their stocks either directly or through a public mutual fund when they or a mutual fund sell their stock to a private equity fund in a buyout they receive a modest premium over the original market price for the shares they sell but once the company is private they are no longer investors and no longer entitled to share in the companys earnings and growth it is the private equity fund and its clients who will now enjoy all the firms profits so far those profits have been very impressive with the average buyout fund reporting an annual return of last year meanwhile the s&amp p index rose only this difference in returns strongly suggests that public investors are being left holding only stocks in the companies the private equity firms dont want to buy apparently for good reason or that the burden of carrying public shareholders has become a serious drag on corporate performance either way the modern culture of investor entitlement may already be working against investors own interests of course a certain level of investor protection is needed for an honest and healthy public market but public shareholders have more power and influence over corporate directors and executives today than at any time in american business history they are using that power and influence to badger companies to do everything from paying a special dividend to cutting carbon emissions to even reducing the ceos pay meanwhile as public shareholders are becoming more "high maintenance " they are also becoming less important to running a business managers who grow tired of dealing with demanding public shareholders will simply do without them the recent boom in private equity buyouts suggests that the modern trend toward greater shareholder power and protection has already gone too far the proposed "shareholder access" rule would only make things worse in the interests of shareholders themselves the sec should refuse to adopt it ms stout is the paul hastings professor of corporate and securities law at ucla
