mccain is forced to play catch up as support ebbs poll reflects concerns about age war stance a giuliani boomlet washington some months before republican voters begin to select the partys presidential candidate sen john mccain is facing unexpectedly formidable challenges despite courting the party faithful during his seven year wait on deck for a shot at the white house a new wall street journal nbc news poll shows the arizona senator trailing rudy giuliani by more than percentage points and encountering doubts in the party about his age and steadfast support for the iraq war mr mccains support "is softening " says democratic pollster peter hart who conducted the journal nbc survey with republican counterpart neil newhouse republican voters "are window shopping " mr newhouse adds and at this stage finding reasons to look past the familiar mr mccain toward the inspiring post profile of the former new york city mayor all told is shaping up as the worst presidential year in three decades to be the candidate of the republican establishment the spot some in the party think mr mccain has assumed the senators top political strategist john weaver calls himself "quite serene" about the campaigns predicament reflecting the mccain teams judgment that the giuliani boomlet will fade the journal nbc poll itself suggests that may well happen as voters learn more about the new yorker but the "strong leader" wave mr giuliani has ridden since the terrorist attacks has increased the pressure mr mccain faces from supporters and campaign donors to make that happen sooner and it has already accelerated a mccain campaign timetable that once anticipated a more leisurely early pace in advance of an earlier than expected formal campaign announcement in april mccain aides vow a faster paced travel schedule that gets the senator out of washington and connecting with voters he will embark on bus tours of iowa and new hampshire home to the earliest primary contests next week the mccain team argues that national polls overstate mr giulianis power in the race not only because the new yorkers social views are out of step with republican conservatives but because mr mccain is stronger in key early primary states yet they insist they wont soon joust with mr giuliani in an attempt to blunt his momentum instead they aim to protect mr mccains reputation for positive campaigning while hoping the media and lagging republican candidates former massachusetts gov mitt romney former arkansas gov mike huckabee and kansas sen sam brownback feel greater urgency to scrutinize mr giulianis record and stances on hot button issues it is far different terrain than mccain advisers expected as they set out methodically in recent years to build a front runners fortress of establishment endorsements financial strength and organizational infrastructure in critical states in a party that has traditionally respected hierarchy the runner up in the republican primaries was pursuing the same strategy that worked for george w bush that year bob dole in vice president george h w bush in and ronald reagan in president gerald fords near loss in the primaries to mr reagan was rare for a republican front runner yet mr mccain has seen mr giuliani race past him earlier than any of those republicans faced serious challenge in a two way matchup of the best known republican contenders mr giuliani leads to when also ran candidates are included mr giulianis lead is more than double his margin from a december journal nbc poll the telephone survey of adults conducted march carries a margin of error of percentage points the poll shows mr mccains problems are partly personal and partly the result of the iraq wars shadow over the broader political environment after years in which his maverick stance on issues from taxes to campaign finance grated on the party faithful one in five republicans express negative views of mr mccain and a similar proportion vow not to vote for him that is double the negative views about mr giuliani some of americans overall and of republicans express reservations about the fact that mr mccain now years old would be the oldest president elected to a first term more ominously of americans and of republicans express discomfort with his support for sending more u s troops to iraq nor is mr mccain helped by general voter unhappiness with republican leaders in washington president bush with whom the arizonan has worked to repair relations after their bitter contest remains bogged down with a job approval rating of just the poll shows democratic front runner hillary clinton is also facing a stiffer early challenge than her advisers anticipated among democrats the new york senators lead over sen barack obama now stands at down from in december in a two way matchup mrs clinton leads her illinois colleague by a narrower echoing mr mccains situation of democrats say they definitely wouldnt vote for mrs clinton twice the number who say that of mr obama and while seven in democrats embrace mr obamas call to withdraw troops from iraq about half express discomfort with mrs clintons refusal to call her vote to authorize the war a mistake mr hart the democratic pollster notes that mr obamas recent entry on the national stage leaves his support vulnerable to shifting political winds but with of americans now recognizing mr obamas name mr newhouse adds the survey shows "he is a real credible serious threat to hillary " mrs clintons challenge pales in comparison to mr mccains he has seen his main rival a backer of abortion rights in a socially conservative party seize the front runner mantle which can itself be a self fulfilling source of momentum mr giulianis campaign so far mr hart observes resembles "a hydroplane skimming over the surface" of intraparty ideological rifts he boasts more favorable ratings than mr mccain across the political spectrum and leads among conservative republicans by to mccain advisers insist the journal nbc polls national findings distort the actual state of competition they cite mccain leads in the polls in the critical battlegrounds of new hampshire and south carolina and a stronger organization in iowa the campaign routinely rolls out fresh endorsements yesterday seven state attorneys general publicly backed mr mccains candidacy but mr mccain now faces heightened pressure to reassert his financial preeminence when first quarter contribution reports are filed with the federal election commission next month mccain strategists expect him to lead both messrs giuliani and romney but within his camp there is also speculation that mr giulianis rise has impeded the senators early fund raising haul "they need to rebrand mccain " one adviser said yesterday harking back to the independent streak the arizonan displayed with his "straight talk express " around the time of his formal announcement next month mr mccain is expected to offer a renewed emphasis on spending restraint and other domestic issues that could help reduce the unremitting focus on the unpopular iraq war to be sure the poll shows mr giuliani is vulnerable when that happens fully three of four republicans including a majority of those backing the former new york city mayor say they would have reservations if they learned mr giuliani supports abortion rights and supports civil unions for gay and lesbian couples one in five republicans expresses discomfort with the fact mr giuliani has been married three times at the same time mr giulianis camp is counting on his strong security profile as "americas mayor" after the sept attacks and that a restless public will seek change from outside washington the latest encouraging sign for that view the criminal conviction this week of former vice presidential aide lewis "scooter" libby in the cia leak case the wall street journal nbc news poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of american adults conducted march by the polling organizations of peter hart and neil newhouse the sample was drawn in the following manner geographic points were randomly selected proportionate to the population of each region and within each region by size of place individuals were selected by a method that gave all telephone numbers listed and unlisted an equal chance of being included one adult years or older was selected from each household by a procedure to provide a balance of respondents by sex the datas margin of error is plus or minus percentage points sample tolerances for subgroups are larger
