politics &amp economics democrats bill pays for surge sets limit washington ending weeks of stalemate house democrats hope to have found a way to move ahead with an iraq war spending bill while still pressing president bush for a change in u s policy the administration would get a relatively free hand to increase u s forces in iraq by what is expected to be more than troops in coming months but the bill also pressures the iraqi government to meet benchmarks by oct or risk a withdrawal of u s forces by end of march "congress has the power of the purse and were trying to exercise it in a way that does not damage the troops " said rep david obey d wis house appropriations committee chairman "and i think weve got a way you build it step by step " last night the leadership began vetting the proposal with the caucuss liberal and moderate factions as well as the large number of democratic freshman elected in november after campaigns very much shaped by the war adjustments could still be made but the appropriations committee was preparing last night to begin to announce the package this morning and move toward a committee markup next week significant additional spending both for national security and domestic budgets is part of the political mix an estimated &# billion would be added for defense spending beyond the presidents request and the total bill could be in the range of &# billion when all the add ons are counted billions will be added for homeland security and veterans and child health care as well as a package of farm disaster aid important to rural more conservative democratic lawmakers whose support to important to the larger package republicans are threatening to withhold their votes which puts a greater burden on house speaker nancy pelosi to hold her party together defeat of the bill would be a dangerous victory for republicans because in the next few months the pentagon will run short of money needed for operations in iraq and afghanistan through the rest of the fiscal year ending sept "if the president is stuck and needs money to fund the war you dont shoot the burro thats carrying it " said rep dennis hastert r ill ms pelosis predecessor in the speakers chair the backroom negotiations over the bill in recent days underscored the divisions among democrats over the war an ambivalence also found in the public at large as captured in a new wall street journal nbc news poll among adults interviewed said they felt strongly in opposition to mr bushs decision to boost troop levels only felt strongly in favor but when asked if congress should restrict funding to bar the president from sending more troops those interviewed were more evenly divided felt strongly in favor of congressional action to restrict funding were strongly opposed yet those surveyed indicated they were more worried about congress doing too little not too much to pressure mr bush to cut troop levels in iraq fifty one percent feared lawmakers wont go far enough feared they would go too far following the november elections democrats are sensitive to these views and the need to take an activist approach on iraq ms pelosi was able to unite the party behind a nonbinding resolution against the troop increase but she was forced to back away from funding proposals that would have effectively set a cap on the troop increase below mr bushs target the crucial language threatening an earlier withdrawal appears more of a policy statement than a strict use of the power of the purse because the funding bill itself runs out sept but mr obey says the goal is "to put in print what the limits of our patience are with the iraqi politicians on the military and the political front " the basic structure would call for the president to certify if the iraqi government had met specified political and military benchmarks by oct if mr bush cant certify such progress the u s would withdraw forces over the next days if mr bush feels the standards have been met withdrawal wouldnt begin until next spring
