debating standards for mortgage lenders subprime defaults prompt calls for new rules ensuring that loans suit borrowers as more homeowners fall behind on their mortgage payments the debate is heating up over whether lenders should be required to ensure that the loans they issue are suitable for their customers just what is a suitable mortgage is likely to depend on a borrowers circumstances but already some states including ohio and pennsylvania are calling on mortgage lenders and brokers to do their best to put borrowers in loans that they are able to repay toward that goal federal banking regulators last week proposed guidelines for lenders who issue adjustable rate mortgages to subprime borrowers congress also is taking a close look at mortgage lending practices with consumer groups pressing lawmakers to impose a suitability standard on lenders the mortgage bankers association which says a suitability requirement would make mortgages more costly is working on voluntary disclosure standards for its members aimed at making it easier for borrowers to understand the pros and cons of various loans but mandating lenders to consider a loans suitability likely would force them to make only the most conservative loans says kurt pfotenhauer a senior vice president of the association lenders will "deny credit to people who deserve credit " he says suitability standards exist elsewhere in the financial services industry securities brokers and brokerage firms are required to have reasonable grounds for believing that investments such as stocks and bonds are suitable for their customers financial status and investment objectives imposing similar requirements on mortgage lenders proponents say would help homeowners such as joseph ripplinger a former construction worker mr ripplinger was happy to refinance when his mortgage broker late last year offered a loan that would lower the minneapolis residents monthly payments "he told me he could get me a good deal because my credit is a lot better " says mr ripplinger what mr ripplinger wound up with was a loan called an option adjustable rate mortgage which offers a low introductory interest rate but the loan balance can grow over time if the borrower regularly makes the minimum payment given his monthly income from social security and disability payments mr ripplinger says it will be hard to keep current on his loan as his payments begin to climb over the next few years "i believed him when he told me it was a good deal but i guess it wasnt " mr ripplinger says he plans to testify on friday before the minnesota house of representatives which is considering mortgage legislation "its not suitable to put someone in a loan they cant pay back or if its going to be unaffordable in two years " says jordan ash director of the acorn financial justice center in st paul minn an advocacy group the heightened focus on mortgage suitability comes as delinquencies are on the rise some of mortgages were delinquent in the fourth quarter the highest level since early according to equifax inc and moodys economy com inc lenders also are being affected a growing list of lenders that cater to borrowers with scuffed credit records have shut their doors other lenders are tightening their standards making it harder for some individuals to refinance into new mortgages or buy a home roughly two thirds of mortgages are now packaged into securities and sold to investors world wide that and other innovations have made credit cheaper and more available helping more people to afford a home the national homeownership rate stood at in the fourth quarter according to the u s census bureau thats up from about in but many borrowers still think they are dealing with a "paternal" lender "who wouldnt put me in a loan i cant repay " says ohio attorney general marc dann an ohio law that took effect in january requires mortgage brokers and loan officers to make "reasonable efforts" to secure a loan with terms that are "advantageous" to the borrower pennsylvanias department of banking will in the next few weeks publish proposed rules that would require mortgage lenders to discern whether borrowers will be able to repay their loan over its life rather than just make the introductory payment in iowa attorney general tom miller is proposing legislation that would require mortgage brokers to place customers in loans that are in the "best interests of the borrower and not the mortgage lender " north carolina already requires that mortgage brokers "make reasonable efforts to secure a loan that is reasonably advantageous to the borrower " consumer groups say they are looking to ensure that borrowers arent put into mortgages that are destined to fail "at its very core suitability is about the borrowers ability to repay the loan " says deborah goldstein executive vice president of the center for responsible lending a nonprofit research and lobbying group a recent study by the center estimated that about of subprime loans originated in and will end in foreclosure borrowers who took out exotic mortgages also are running into trouble felipe duluna a landscaper bought a house in watsonville calif in mr duluna used his life savings of &# as a down payment and took out a first and second mortgage to finance the balance of the &# purchase price less than two years later as his interest rate reset higher and his loan balance grew mr duluna is unable to make even the minimum payment on the option adjustable rate mortgage he received speaking through a translator because he is fluent only in spanish mr duluna says he was told that the loan was something he could afford mr duluna says he trusted the mortgage broker who was also the real estate agent on the sale and told him repeatedly that he couldnt spend more than &# a month on mortgage payments given mr dulunas annual income of &# and his familys combined income of about &# "these folks have no ability to actually afford this loan " says mr dulunas attorney pamela simmons with simmons &amp purdy in weighing whether a loan is suitable lenders might need to consider the borrowers financial circumstances ability to repay the loan and their objectives consumer groups say "its not enough to say somebody is qualified for a loan if they are left with &# or a small amount after the mortgage is paid " says allen fishbein director of housing and credit policy for the consumer federation of america whether a loan is suitable depends on a variety of factors including a borrowers current situation and future plans experts say an adjustable rate mortgage could be a smart choice for borrowers who expect to move in a few years or believe their salaries will rise to accommodate higher monthly payments but the same loan could be dangerous for someone on a fixed income another factor to consider is how much of a borrowers income will be devoted to housing some lenders will allow homeowners to spend as much as of their gross income on mortgage payments taxes and insurance but that doesnt leave enough of a cushion for most people says mitch ohlbaum a mortgage broker in los angeles even in a high cost market such as california "for a regular guy in a regular job is the most they should be looking at " mr miller the iowa attorney general advises borrowers to be wary of loans with low "teaser rates" and loans with prepayment penalties that can make selling a home or refinancing costly rather than focusing on the initial payment borrowers should consider their ability to pay "not just the first payment or payments for the first couple of years but the first five years or even longer" if they plan to stay put he says another consideration is what will happen if things dont work out as planned many borrowers took out adjustable rate mortgages and exotic loans figuring they would refinance in a few years "one of the things that is driving the increased default rate is people who thought they could solve their problems by refinancing " says kurt eggert a professor at chapman university school of law in orange calif tighter lending standards a soft housing market and in some cases their own credit problems are making refinancing less of an option for some borrowers
