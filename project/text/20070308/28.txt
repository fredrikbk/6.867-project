dont get caught in a losing battle over dvd technology competition in technology products is often a good thing microsoft and apple spur each other on by competing in computer operating systems research in motions blackberry smart phones and palms treo models have the same sort of rivalry partisans of these platforms can argue all day about which is better but the competitors have some things in common windows computers and apple macintoshes can both display the same photos and office documents and play the same mp songs and youtube videos blackberrys and treos can receive the same emails and call the same phone numbers it isnt perfect there are some files that dont play well across platforms but most common content does yet theres another technology competition that doesnt share content well and offers few if any benefits to consumers its the fight among two groups of technology companies and movie studios to sell a successor to the dvd each has developed a new type of disc that has the ability to show movies in high definition to my eye the pictures they deliver are identical neither of these competing new discs called blu ray and hd dvd works in current dvd players they require very expensive new players and the new players cant handle both new disc formats only one or the other adding to the annoyance some movie studios release movies only in one of the two formats paramount and warner brothers support both formats but universal supports only hd dvd and disney fox and sony only blu ray so in order to be sure you can play any movie released as a high definition disc you would have to replace your old dvd player with two new much costlier players it would be like having to buy separate tv sets to watch different networks programs now however one gutsy company lg electronics of korea a longtime member of the blu ray camp has broken ranks and introduced a new combo player that can handle three formats blu ray hd dvd and regular old dvds its called the bh super multi blue ive tested this combo player and found that it plays both new formats as well as regular dvds just fine but its more expensive than most single format players and has some serious limitations when navigating through the menus on hd dvd titles for now i can only recommend it for serious videophiles with deep pockets but im hoping its the start of a trend that will end the foolish war the bh costs &# thats vastly more expensive than the newest dvd players which for less than &# can take a regular dvd and "upscale" it so it looks better on a high definition set but that &# isnt so outrageous if you compare it with the price of buying two separate blu ray and hd dvd players which can reach or exceed &# total and the new lg takes up only one input on your tv occupies less space on your component shelf and requires just one remote control i tested the lg combo player on my high definition tv with this years oscar winning best picture "the departed " and with "superman returns " each of which is available in both of the new formats as well as on dvd all played perfectly the picture looked great in both formats and was noticeably better than an upscaled dvd image which the lg unit also can produce the lg outputs both new formats in a high but grossly overhyped resolution called "p " but the bh did a much better job with the blu ray discs than with the hd dvd titles thats because while the combo player can play hd dvd movies perfectly it cant display the hd dvd discs menus for selecting scenes or accessing special features these menus usually offer the title and a photo to identify a scene and the title and or a description of the special feature but on the lg bh the hd dvd menus have no pictures titles or descriptions and look nothing like the original they only identify scenes by number and duration that makes it hard to find say the deleted scenes from "the departed " or the documentaries on the superman disc the bh was based on a blu ray only player and lacks the special chips hd dvd players use to display the menus properly lg had to concoct its own rudimentary replacements for those menus the company says a future combo model could include the chips and thus display the hd dvd menus as well as it does the blu ray menus but it hasnt decided whether to make such a product one reason for that decision may be the competing approach to solving the stupid disc war warner brothers is working on a combo disc instead of a combo player this disc would hold both the blu ray and hd dvd versions of a movie so you could pop it into whichever type of player you own until the electronics and movie companies support universal high definition players and or universal high definition discs i dont recommend that most people invest in either technology why prolong a war thats bad for consumers email me at mossberg wsj com see video versions of my reviews at wsj com mossbergvideo
