irish anglers say dukes river claim is pretty fishy locals cite magna carta in bid to hook salmon but court doesnt bite so when irishman michael oshea a glass cutter at the nearby waterford crystal factory deliberately cast his rod on the river in without permission he reopened a legal can of worms mr oshea and sympathetic locals here have invoked the magna carta from the th century to challenge the claim that a mile stretch of the river irelands second largest waterway is the sole property of a british duke "i think its ridiculous that anyone even a duke can claim he owns a river " says olly casey a councilman for the town of youghal pronounced yall where the river empties into the sea the th duke of devonshire peregrine andrew morny cavendish years old begs to differ his family has owned storied lismore castle on the banks of the blackwater for four centuries even though the duke doesnt own all of the land along the river he contends his ancestors acquired ownership of the riverbed near lismore down to the sea and all the water flowing through it when they bought lismore from sir walter "if someone has owned something for years and paid rates taxes on it its not entirely appropriate to say it belongs to someone else is it " says michael penruddock the british manager of the dukes irish estates today the duke rents out his castle for as much as &# a week prince charles and camilla stayed there before their wedding he also runs an exclusive fishing lodge careysville house on the river which charges guests about &# a week each and boasts visitors such as golfer tiger woods with such high paying tourists theres little patience for alleged freeloaders like mr oshea whom an irish court fined &# and convicted of illegal fishing mr oshea is appealing the dispute has brought a renewed focus on irelands centuries of struggle against british dominion and on a conflict dating back to the late middle ages over private ownership of many of the countrys rivers one of the lodges selling points is a th century dam near the dukes fishing lodge that slows the passage of salmon as they swim inland to spawn giving the anglers a bounty of fish recently the irish government ordered the duke to remove the dam which engineers say prevents atlantic salmon from reaching their spawning grounds the dam has fish "ladders " like steps that are supposed to help the fish gradually splash to the top a government researcher instead observed "salmon hurtling themselves often in vain" against the dam according to a report that called the structure a "trap " without the dam it might be harder to hook a salmon at the lodge the duke has filed a lawsuit in irelands high court to block the governments order to demolish the dam a hearing is set for later this month the dukes family fortune is estimated at nearly &# billion it began to grow in the mid s when an ancestor earned the gratitude of king henry viii a protestant by helping shut down catholic monasteries in england the family has held lismore through turbulent times when ireland established its independence from england in its leaders considered radical land reform that would have driven out the british aristocracy instead the leaders allowed property owners to keep hereditary estates that benefited fred astaires sister adele she lived at lismore from to after marrying lord charles cavendish peregrines great uncle disputes over access rights to rivers flare up all over britain and ireland are among the stricter countries when it comes to barring the public from private waterways in the u s for example the supreme court has affirmed that the public owns rivers "navigable" by boat even those that run through private property says eric leaper executive director of the national organization for rivers in the th century an irish farmer challenged the th duke of devonshires right to exclude fishermen from the tidal section of the blackwater near the sea after years of legal battles the british house of lords in issued a lengthy decision affirming the dukes control in the late s when the seaside town of youghal considered making improvements to its harbor mr penruddock sent the town a letter reminding the town council the duke owned the river bed mr casey the councilman scoured government archives to counter the dukes claim there he discovered a charter by englands king james i granting the town of youghal control of the waters within its boundaries he also points to an ancient sword and ceremonial staff that represented the towns dominion over the water mr osheas troubles began in when a private fishing association leased rights from the dukes trust to a stretch of riverbank which mr oshea had fished for years this elite association which sells memberships to fishermen in america and elsewhere gives the duke another source of income beyond his lodge and castle the club wouldnt take mr oshea and his friends as members a letter from the club gives no reason they also say they cant afford to pay the clubs day permit rate of about &# just to go fishing after work they went to the blackwater anyway to cast their rods the clubs warden arrived and demanded the permit fee "i ignored him and kept fishing " says fellow laid off glass cutter pat ryan messrs ryan and oshea and four other locals were ultimately charged with trespassing on the blackwater "for the purpose or the pretence of killing fish therein " the group continued to fish in mr oshea was picked up again and prosecuted at a hearing mr osheas lawyer argued that the magna carta the th century bill of rights that influenced the u s constitution supersedes the dukes claims of ownership the magna carta a broad document which sought to protect people against arbitrary decrees of english sovereigns also gave the public the right to fish on large navigable tidal rivers that werent already under private ownership by the mid th century mr osheas lawyer paddy gordon said blackwater wasnt privately owned that early making its river publicly accessible asked about the magna carta claim mr penruddock the dukes representative rolled his eyes a local judge sided with the duke and fined mr oshea citing the house of lords ruling favoring the aristocrat "one hundred and twenty two years have lapsed since that ruling " judge james mcnulty said "and there has been no serious challenge brought by any person to the title of the duke of devonshire " while mr osheas appeal is pending in an irish circuit court he has stayed off the river but his friend mr ryan is defiant and fished there last month "it was lovely " he says
