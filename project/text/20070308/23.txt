d day in little rock a civil rights showdown ikes final battle by kasey s pipes world ahead pages &# in spring as the supreme court was deliberating on brown v board of education president dwight d eisenhower invited chief justice earl warren to a stag dinner at the white house he seated warren at the same table as john w davis the lawyer who had argued against school desegregation before the court eisenhower proceeded to tell the chief justice what a "great man" davis was as it happened eisenhower had authorized his justice department to file an amicus brief in the case opposing davis and public school segregation and he specifically allowed his solicitor general lee rankin to tell the justices during oral argument that "separate but equal" schools were unconstitutional yet he sympathized with the segregated south "these are not bad people " he told warren at the dinner "all they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown negroes " warren was appalled to put it kindly eisenhower was ambivalent on civil rights "conservative by nature he hoped that the advance of the civil rights movement would be gradual allowing time for the south to change " writes kasey s pipes in "ikes last battle " most of all eisenhower didnt want to lead a civil rights crusade from the white house "the only crusade he had ever wanted to lead was liberating europe in world war ii " mr pipes says but when necessary or when steps toward desegregation were relatively painless eisenhower acted he broke the color barrier in the military by deploying black soldiers alongside whites to win the battle of the bulge in december and january as president he integrated the schools and movie theaters in washington d c and federal installations around the country most important he sent u s army troops to little rock ark in september to escort nine black students into central high school after days of violent protest it was a defeat from which segregationist forces never recovered "little rock represented something else as well the culmination of eisenhowers own attitude toward racial justice " mr pipes writes "ike had enjoyed the luxury of endorsing civil rights in broad terms knowing full well that much of segregation law was a state and local matter little rock ended that " two days after the army troops arrived in little rock eisenhower decided to address the nation on prime time television this surprised his attorney general herbert brownell who had been prodding eisenhower for years to act more boldly on civil rights the president wrote most of the speech himself including a passage suggested by secretary of state john foster dulles arguing that violent opposition to racial integration was weakening americas influence and prestige in the world in the speech eisenhower lauded the desegregation efforts of other southern communities and their willingness to comply with federal law this was a new tack for the president who had refused to endorse brown v board of education the supreme courts decision declaring segregated public schools unconstitutional nor had he denounced the murder of emmett till by racist thugs in mississippi in despite pleas by the teenage boys mother "he feared that moralizing from the bully pulpit would raise not only awareness but also the collective blood pressure of the south " mr pipes writes "he saw no point in riling an already angry population to put it bluntly eisenhower had little interest in trying to change the minds of millions of southerners " but he had learned a lesson from little rock his view had been as mr pipes puts it that "segregationists and civil rights advocates were cut from the same cloth " in his dealings with arkansas gov orval faubus he learned otherwise faubus betrayed eisenhower in the midst of the little rock crisis as arkansass national guard was blocking the nine black students from central high faubus had agreed to meet the president in newport r i at the end of their minute talk faubus gave the president the clear impression that he would change the national guards orders requiring it to protect the black students as they entered central high but faubus didnt follow through eisenhower felt double crossed and told brownell "you were right faubus broke his word " the president then took the next step dispatching the st airborne mr pipes is not a professional historian he is a public relations consultant and speechwriter who worked in the bush white house from to but he has written a highly readable and credible account of eisenhowers struggle with race and civil rights while sympathetic he doesnt sugarcoat eisenhowers qualms about desegregation or excuse his unwillingness to move decisively before little rock eisenhower famously regretted his appointment of earl warren as chief justice warren served in that role from to warren confronted eisenhower about the presidents feelings toward him when they flew together to winston churchills funeral in eisenhower explained that it was warrens liberal rulings on national security that had upset him he didnt mention brown v board of education and understandably so years earlier eisenhower had told an aide privately that he thought the brown decision was wrong by he had concluded that it was right mr
