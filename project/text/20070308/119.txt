wonder land why be president is the nations future too important to be left to presidential candidates given their druthers the candidates arrayed before us likely would photo op their way from here to the acceptance speech last weekend hillary clinton and barack obama competed for inheritor of the civil rights legacy circa selma while messrs giuliani romney gingrich and five others skipped stones across the surface of conservative conventional wisdom at the cpac convention ok this is what politicians do or this is what they do when the imperatives of the modern presidential campaign require that one run full tilt boogie toward the office months before the primaries and some days before the nation chooses a new president but what does any of it have to do with us with whats going on in the real world outside the cottage industry of our politics we and they seem to be operating in separate universes just now they in the beanbag political world as defined by campaign consultants and we in the world defined by al qaeda mahmoud ahmadinejad kim jong il and vladimir putin the world beyond americas borders isnt dormant it is a globalized world trembling with problems and troubles that will remain after george bush leaves office iraqs future irans bomb homicidal islam conniving north korea unhelpful russia rising china booming india venezuelas oil mexicos human export in our system these matters are the responsibility of a president but the campaign is devolving into a campaign about nothing rudys kids hillarys "apology" set against the moment of the office they wish to hold this is infantile republican candidate policy is unavoidably yoked to the bush patrimony more or less john mccain is the undisputed master of the art of more or less the greater burden of proof falls on the democratic contenders the democratic party has built opposition to the presidency of george bush wholly around the war in iraq so much so that the democratic partys worldview by now resembles a steinberg new yorker cartoon a wavy circle around iraq or even just baghdad with nothing beyond but vaporous nation shapes its no accident that their major foreign policy effort should be "non binding " for the purposes of picking the next president we should be glad that democrats have made the presidency itself its foreign policy decisions and the use of presidential authority guantanamo wiretapping the war decision the core of their criticism hillary clinton barack obama and john edwards are their standard bearers logically one wonders what do they think a presidency should be what are their views on the exercise of presidential authority lets find out now before its too late historically a u s presidents tools are two soft power and hard power soft power is diplomacy hard power is the military the question that one wants answered soon is have the democrats become a soft power only party hillary clinton especially has berated the bush presidency for not being willing to "talk" to the likes of iran and syria reading democratic foreign policy intellectuals of late it is hard to find the conditions under which they would deploy u s military resources the military option may be on the democrats table but its buried beneath a foot high pile of talking points have the democrats in their opposition to the bush doctrine forced anyone seeking their nomination into a soft power only corner someone should ask them this matter links unavoidably to presidential authority presidents and the congress live in perpetual tension over the uses and limits of presidential authority nothing new there and with george bush both republicans and democrats have sought to rein in presidential power notably in their dispute over wiretaps and the fisa statute but the democrats have gone further the current murtha proposal in the house on troop deployments is a hard challenge to presidential authority they also have tried to thwart less controversial exercises of presidential authority refusing votes on judicial nominees and putting holds on executive branch appointments sen clinton as president would you assent to these limits on executive power or would you refuse to abide them sen edwards is carl levins reading of the fisa statute on the wiretapping of suspected terrorists your reading of that statute sen obama do you support the murtha proposal on iraq could you all elaborate your understanding of the term "commander in chief" or the war powers resolution or the pardon power congressional ambivalence toward presidential authority is likely a large part of the fact that no sitting senators other than john f kennedy and warren g harding have ascended to the presidency rudy giuliani may be outstripping john mccain because voters see sen mccain as a creature however eminent of congress bill clinton established the outer limits of domestic presidential authority would clinton settle for less not likely but someone should ask her even if you argue that mr bush brought this on himself the fact remains that presidential authority is in a hole at this rate of erosion there will be such lack of clarity about the presidential role come january that any new president will spend an entire term merely reestablishing his or her authority a democratic president who hasnt drawn a line in the presidential sand will be in hock to the partys pacifist left absent a vigorous debate on these matters we are likely to elect a weak president no matter who wins there is no bigger campaign issue than the proper role of the presidency on current course our winner the morning of nov may be uttering robert redfords famous last line in "the candidate" "what do we do now " as with the primaries lets move up the answer to that question
