new generation of cardiac stents awaits fda approval questions about safety could slow agencys review addressing clotting issues as patients and doctors wrestle with the potential risks of drug eluting stents used to treat heart disease manufacturers are offering the prospect of a new generation of devices that could be safer stents are tiny metal devices widely used to prop open clogged cardiac arteries the drug eluting or drug coated varieties have gained popularity over the original bare metal stents because the addition of drugs helps prevent the artery from reclogging but increasingly the drug eluting versions have come under scrutiny for an increased risk of life threatening though still rare blood clots now a number of new drug eluting stents from boston scientific corp medtronic inc johnson &amp johnson and abbott laboratories are queuing up or nearing a filing at the food and drug administration to win u s marketing approval several others are in earlier stages of development and some are already on the market in europe the manufacturers hope the new technologies help overcome the potential clotting risk of current devices though few have significant data to back up the hypotheses exactly what causes the clotting problem isnt clear but it is thought that either the design of the devices which are tiny metal scaffolds the polymer that holds and releases the drug or the drug itself might prevent the bodys healing response from completely covering the implanted stent with tissue that could leave a portion of the stents surface exposed to the blood stream where it has the potential to trigger a clot whether the patient takes blood thinners and how accurately the physician implants the device may also play a role a large question is whether safety concerns that are hanging over the current stents will apply to this new crop of devices a prospect that could slow their journey to market right now there are only two drug eluting stents on the u s market johnson &amp johnsons cypher and boston scientifics taxus express sales of both have slipped as a result of criticism from scientists and clinicians in december the fda convened a high profile panel of experts to debate drug coated stent use after listening to two days of presentations the committee concluded that drug coated stents are associated with a small increase in late thrombosis blood clots but that the increased risk wasnt associated with an increased risk of death or heart attack yesterday at a cardiology meeting called crt key members from that panel and the fda continued to discuss potential new requirements in the approval process for new devices the fda is planning to issue guidance as early as this spring "we cant have had this two day panel meeting and have heard all we heard in december and ignore it " says ashley boam the fdas branch chief for interventional cardiology devices and a speaker at crt she says the agency is likely to start requiring up to five years of postapproval studies on drug eluting stents "however were sensitive toward finding a middle ground " she says among the new drug coated stents in the wings is the endeavor device from medtronic the company submitted endeavor for fda consideration in november and expects u s approval in the second part of this year its on sale abroad in countries medtronics early findings suggest that endeavor could have a lower risk of thrombosis blood clots than do bare metal stents endeavors drug and polymer combination doesnt prevent the regrowth of tissue the thing that drug coated stents were designed to address as aggressively as some competitors that could be an advantage though if it turns out that it reduces the risk that the metal stents would be exposed to the blood stream and thus further minimize chances of a clot abbott laboratories is selling xience the drug eluting stent it got by acquiring part of guidant corp last year in some overseas markets it is aiming to file for u s approval in the coming months boston scientific will sell a private label version of xience called promus xience has a different hypothesis supporting it its thought to be thinner and more flexible than some other stents leaving less of the device for platelets to possibly catch on and build up the so called struts on a stent the pieces of metal that keep the scaffold together are about half the size of the ones on the cypher stent says john m capek president of abbotts vascular division abbott is also presenting data his month on its bioabsorbable stent which will dissolve and be metabolized by the body over time and which is at least five years from hitting the market johnson &amp johnson after buying conor medsystems late last year has gained control of a next generation coated stent now being sold in europe and parts of asia which it plans to submit to u s regulators this year the conor stent called costar has a polymer that dissolves completely turning the drug eluting stent into a bare metal stent over a six month period the drug and polymer it uses are held in wells inside the stent so much less of the mixture touches the arterial wall than in stents where the drug and polymer are spread out on the stents surface says frank litvack the former chief executive of conor and now a consultant to j&amp j johnson &amp johnson also has a follow on stent to cypher called cypher elite and says it will start clinical trials in the u s this year boston scientifics follow on to taxus express called taxus liberte was submitted for regulatory review in march it is on the market everywhere except the u s and japan the taxus liberte cant receive fda approval until a warning letter on an unrelated issue lifts but paul laviolette the companys chief operating officer says he expects the restriction to be removed and the stent to come onto the market in the second half of this year that device uses the same drug and polymer as the earlier taxus express but has a different stent geometry and thinner struts which could make it more flexible and easier to implant doctors are cautiously optimistic but say they want to see more data before making up their minds right now medtronic has data on patients for two years abbott only has two year data on patients and one year data on robert applegate a professor of cardiology at wake forest university school of medicine who has used many of the new stents as part of clinical investigations but isnt a paid consultant of any of the companies says the ideas are promising but he says more evidence of long term safety would "relieve some of the current anxiety about drug eluting stent use "
