the numbers guy odds of lost tomb being jesus family rest on assumptions online edition until two weeks ago university of toronto statistician andrey feuervergers body of research encompassed uncontroversial topics such as medical scanning and correcting for camera blurring so he was unprepared for the reaction to his work for the discovery channel documentary "the lost tomb of jesus " which aired on sunday the tomb is a set of limestone coffins or ossuaries found in jerusalem in bearing the names yeshua bar yosef jesus son of joseph maria mary matia matthew yose a nickname for joseph mariamene e mara a form of mary and yehuda bar yeshua judah son of jesus prof feuerverger calculated there is just a one in chance that those same names would have come together in a family that didnt belong to jesus of nazareth that calculation helped propel the already explosive story "it was really the thing that began to convince us all to give this more attention " says james tabor chair of religious studies at the university of north carolina charlotte who advised the filmmakers and prof feuerverger and appears in the two hour documentary but the one in calculation is based on many assumptions about the prevalence of the names and their biblical significance for purposes of his calculations prof feuerverger relied on new scholarly research that links the inscription "mariamene e mara" with a name for mary magdalene the filmmakers suggest that she was christs wife and that they are buried with a son judah claims hotly denounced by traditional christians had the professor assumed the inscription could be for any mary a very common name then it would be far less likely that christs family is in the tomb the mathematical finding would become "statistically not significant " prof feuerverger tells me similarly the name "yose" as one of jesus four brothers was called in the gospel of mark is a derivative of yosef another common name there too the finding would be less conclusive if the professor had considered "yose" applicable to any yosef even if there was consensus on the interpretation of the names there are no comprehensive records showing how frequently they occurred in the population at that time prof feuerverger relied on modern books about ossuaries and ancient texts to tally the occurrence of certain names in the area then that falls far short of a complete census "as you pile on more assumptions youre building a house of cards " says keith devlin a stanford mathematician and nprs "math guy " scientific american also challenged the calculation on its web site no one is questioning prof feuervergers statistical credentials or his calculation given the assumptions made for each of the names believed to be appropriate for jesus or an associate prof feuerverger calculated the probability it would arise by chance then adjusted for other factors such as the number of tombs in jerusalem but his conclusion is only as reliable as the assumptions that went into it "i wouldnt be comfortable coming up with a number like this because the general audience will not understand that it is very very subjective " says ivo dinov assistant professor of statistics at the university of california los angeles the case is far from closed on this tomb prof feuerverger who says he was paid a "nominal" sum for his work had signed a nondisclosure agreement with associated producers barring him from describing the project and so limiting his ability to run his work by his peers he still hasnt provided full documentation of his calculation saying hed wait until his paper not yet completed is accepted by a journal "there is a mismatch between how the media works and how academia works " prof feuerverger says "obviously it would have been a whole lot better if i had completed the paper" before the documentary aired writer director simcha jacobovici says he went to great lengths to find a responsible number initial "ballpark" calculations based on the incidence of the names including one made by charles pellegrino co author of the documentarys companion book found even smaller probabilities that the tomb wasnt that of jesus family mr jacobovici then turned to the university of toronto down the street from his production offices and tapped prof feuerverger to do the calculations with greater rigor "we told him charlie came out with million to " mr jacobovici says "he said the numbers will come out where the numbers come out " all this has brought some measure of distress to prof feuerverger who nevertheless says he thinks the experience will strengthen him as a human being and as a statistician "when i was doing the calculation i was naively unaware of the extent to which the filmmakers might be depending on the ultimate result of it " he says "i did carry out the calculation in every good faith i hoped it would be interpreted in that light " write to carl bialik at numbersguy wsj com
