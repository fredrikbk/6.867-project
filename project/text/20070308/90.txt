rating the parks of spring training nowadays spring training isnt just about the lazy joys of off the books baseball in sun kissed cities to the south in many ways the monthlong miniseason is starting to mimic the april to october full season with stadiums offering everything from luxury suites to gourmet concessions soba noodles anyone the los angeles dodgers dodgertown facility in vero beach fla features a "ladies spring training clinic" where women can learn the games finer points from pro coaches the chicago cubs spring home in mesa ariz underwent &# in upgrades including the addition of a digital scoreboard that can show instant replays and the philadelphia phillies complex in clearwater fla gives new meaning to the time honored tradition of enjoying a cold one a tiki bar lurks behind the left field wall beckoning fans to enjoy an icy cocktail if it all sounds a bit like visiting a theme park well thats an option too the atlanta braves train at the ballpark in walt disney worlds wide world of sports in lake buena vista fla disney boasts that "kids run the bases after every game literally running in the players footsteps " more states and municipalities see dollar signs in this preseason ritual over the past decade theyve poured hundreds of millions of dollars into new or renovated facilities in an effort to woo teams from other locations arizona has picked up three former florida based teams the chicago white sox kansas city royals and texas rangers or to keep them happily in place with all that money teams have upped the ante for fans providing something closer in spirit to the big league ballpark experience while trying to retain the intimate essence of spring training long a magnet for autograph seekers but teams have also upped the prices tickets can go as high as &# for behind home plate seats at the boston red soxs spring facility in fort myers fla if thats not expensive enough consider what scalpers are asking for a boston game next week versus the new york yankees the teams archrival as much as &# apiece while it might be worth the cost for a little face time with star boston slugger manny ramirez it leaves purists wondering if springtime baseball is at risk of becoming a slick and heaven forbid professional affair so far its not keeping fans away about million people made their way last year to spring training ballparks in florida and arizona to see the state of spring training we visited five ballparks three in florida home of the grapefruit league two in arizona cactus league during opening week and judged everything from the cost of tickets to consistency of the hot dogs we also took note of sightlines surrounding communities and that sense of fan loyalty these parks engender we quickly learned that just because a facility is relatively new it isnt guaranteed to bedazzle at the four year old surprise stadium in surprise ariz the spring home of two teams the kansas city royals and texas rangers the atmosphere was pleasant but sterile sure the seats in the capacity stadium have cupholders and the bathrooms are clean but the ballpark itself is part of a sprawling suburban community with housing developments and big box stores galore and the crowd at the royals vs rangers game we caught was near comatose showing no particular allegiance to either club the public address announcer had to practically beg folks to join in on the seventh inning stretch festivities conversely we were surprised at how an older stadium can continue to charm at dodgertowns holman stadium in vero beach a capacity year old ballpark theres little that separates the players from the fans the players dont even have a covered dugout to hide behind and the compact size a mere rows deep ensures good viewing from just about any vantage point want an autograph just stick around after the game along the outfield lines theres also a sense of history we took note of a plaque from honoring stadium namesake bud holman at the same time the stadiums efforts to get with the times appear a bit misguided a shiny new starbucks concession seems out of place in a facility thats getting a bit long in the tooth and with the dodgers now having made their home base in california for nearly a half century there werent many loyalists in this east coast dominated crowd to cheer them on of course it doesnt hurt to have a winning team to fill seats that was especially the case at the parks we visited that were home to last years pennant winners the american leagues detroit tigers joker marchant stadium in lakeland fla and the national leagues st louis cardinals the world series champs roger dean stadium in jupiter fla in both instances throngs of fans had made the pilgrimage from their respective midwestern cities the capacity nine year old jupiter stadium alone expects to be at capacity this spring and the hometown passion was clearly evident the stadiums capitalize on this in different ways jupiter has built a temporary addition to its team merchandise store to keep up with demand for cardinals gear the capacity lakeland stadium built in renovated in gives fans a literal taste of home at one concession stand youll find hand crafted beers from a kalamazoo microbrewery both stadiums are rich in amenities and relatively comfortable too we loved the pint size baseball diamond off to the side at lakeland a field of dreams for the grade school set to play on and it was hard to beat the concessions at jupiter also the spring home of the florida marlins everything from barbecued ribs to cotton candy the stadium also lays claim to the best baseball park hot dog weve ever had a third of a pound all beef behemoth known as the dean dog but if fanaticism is what you seek youre best off making your way to mesa ariz the spring home of the chicago cubs those lovable losers who have been seeking a world series title since their last championship in at the capacity year old bustling hohokam park the diehards were just about everywhere visiting the four "cubbie hole" merchandise stands gobbling up the "chi town" hot dogs with the requisite bright green relish and sunbathing in the outfield grass berms then again who can blame them for wanting to soak up a few rays in chicago the daytime high was degrees write cranky wsj com team venue tickets chicago cubs hohokam park mesa ariz &# to &# food a meat lovers delight with options including the "arizona fajitas" hot dog smothered in guacamole salsa onions and cheese gourmet choices include wok fired soba noodles &# and buffalo chicken pizza &# ambience energetic and bustling the year old stadium got a &# upgrade this year including a new instant replay scoreboard and two more souvenir stands grass berms behind left and right field are perfect spots for sunbathing player access good we saw the pitchers get drilled on pickoff moves the autograph hot zones are the railings above the outfield lines before games plus a roped off area behind the first base line comment springtime heaven for a cubs fan from the tailgating and posters of past cubs heroes to the old school organ player entertaining the crowds this place is valhalla for the legions of chicagoans who are used to the friendly confines of wrigley field team venue tickets kansas city royals and texas rangers surprise stadium surprise ariz &# to &# food you can scarf a hot dog &# but a better bet may be the meatball and italian sausage sandwiches &# at "taste of italy" stand other options fresh cut potato chips tacos and fat tire amber ale a colorado brew ambience pleasant but sterile the seats are angled toward home plate grassy berm is a great place to watch the action but the announcer had to practically beg the sluggish crowd to take a seventh inning stretch player access decent batting cages right behind the baseline stands allow fans to watch hitters up close players enter the stadium via the bullpens behind the outfield corners so autograph hounds should sit near foul lines and try to grab players as they walk to and from the field comment stadiums location adjacent to big box stores and fast food joints is hardly charming but at least the community offers a man made lake thats stocked with large mouthed bass and channel catfish team venue tickets detroit tigers joker marchant stadium lakeland fla &# to &# food concession stands have a military mess hall theme hence the chicken sandwich is an "aviator chicken sandwich" &# beer stand near general admission seats offers lesser known brews perfect with roasted nuts ambience an older ballpark that has been brought up to contemporary standards good sightlines and an outfield grass berm that even has its own concession stand picking up tickets can take awhile mini baseball diamond is great for kids to play on player access good after the game most everyone is in autograph signing mode you can do particularly well with the opposing team just wait for them to head to the bus thats parked right outside the gates comment stadium doesnt appear to be in a very lively neighborhood but the updated facilities and the excitement surrounding the team make for a fun game day experience even when the weather is almost too hot we got a sunburn team venue tickets los angeles dodgers holman stadium dodgertown vero beach fla &# to &# food the stadium is going the fancy route this year offering everything from starbucks iced mocha drinks &# to specialty beers &# to pulled pork sandwiches &# but the dodger dog &# is good especially when its served piping hot ambience this stadium more than a half century old is a step back in time small and intimate with players sitting within earshot of fans theres no enclosed dugout but its also an entire training complex with its own housing and player friendly amenities fans can even spend the night there are guest rooms player access excellent you really cant get much closer to ballplayers than this its easy to eavesdrop on conversations and collect autographs after the game we admit we even reached into the "dugout" really just a bench and collected an odd souvenir a mostly empty bag of sunflower seeds comment its looking like the dodgers will be leaving the storied dodgertown for arizona the team doesnt have much of an east coast fan base its been almost years since the club left brooklyn for los angeles it doesnt help that the stadium is looking worn in some areas especially the bathrooms team venue tickets st louis cardinals and florida marlins roger dean stadium jupiter fla &# to &# food the expanded array of offerings includes the classics hot dogs draft beer peanuts to the unusual smoked turkey legs st louis style ribs but the dean dog a plus sized all beef hot dog &# is the real find its as good a frank as weve had in any ballpark ambience the stadium has a retro feel but offers modern amenities including luxury suites and a party deck we saw nothing but a sea of red shirted cardinals fans but theres also deep support for the marlins player access outstanding its easy to get autographs even during the game prime spots the areas near where the pitchers sit the marlins seem especially eager to sign and to toss balls to the crowd perhaps in an effort to keep the excitement going through the regular season the team has always had difficulty drawing fans to its miami area stadium comment as complete a spring training experience as you could seek theres so much interest in the cardinals you might think the games actually counted stadium is in a pedestrian friendly new urbanist style community you can even leave in the middle of the game and pay a visit to the local cigar bar or starbucks and return in time for the seventh inning stretch
