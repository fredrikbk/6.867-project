politics &amp economics capital examining signs of a disturbance in the force the moment for instant analysis of global markets sudden dive is fading dissection of alan greenspans musings is getting tired and attempts to explain just how the chinese stock market market capitalization &# trillion might cause the crash of in the u s market cap &# trillion are tortured but big questions linger what is this disturbance in the force yeah ive been watching "star wars" reruns does it presage the end of an unusually vigorous run for the global economy one approach goes like this markets are like fads that come and go investors get a bit giddy the market goes up investors come to their senses the market goes down as long as mr greenspans successor at the federal reserve ben bernanke keeps a steady hand on the tiller the nations economy can keep sailing on theres a lot to that and its reassuring because it suggests recent market volatility is just a return to normal and doesnt say much significant about the economy itself the second approach attempts some economic explanation there are lots of versions floating around heres one that seems plausible the past two decades have been unusually calm for the u s economy economic growth and inflation rates are less volatile the same goes for the rest of the developed world for the past or years for emerging markets its been five years or so this great moderation as its been dubbed has pushed up prices of stocks houses and other assets the more placid the economy the less risky it is to hold such assets the less risky those assets are the more willing investors are to hold them and the less compensation they demand for taking the risk of buying them as opposed to buying virtually risk free u s treasury bonds thats all for the good "confidence appears to beget confidence with recent history giving some measure of plausibility to the notion that very bad macroeconomic outcomes can be avoided " fed governor kevin warsh said in a speech this week the only rub the great moderation isnt a law of physics but a description of recent history if the fed and investors "presume it to be an entitlement" if they get overconfident they could mess it up he said there is a little appreciated but relevant corollary to this if asset prices are high because the global economy is placid then little changes in the global economy or in how people perceive it can yield big swings in markets its like an extremely sensitive volume knob on a stereo a little twist can produce a big change in the decibel level "that is almost certainly a big piece of what happened last week " says harvard economist kenneth rogoff who described this phenomenon in a presentation at the feds jackson hole wyo conference warning mr rogoff notes that the same math suggests that at todays low interest rates stock prices will be more sensitive to quarter point fed interest rate moves than the historical norm mr bernanke cited last week that a quarter point increase in rates by the fed pushes down stocks by between and by this logic the u s stock market might not have been reacting to shanghai but rather markets around the world were reacting to a change in the economic outlook but reacting to what oil prices are below last years highs economies in europe and japan are looking good for a change the housing slump has barely dented u s consumer spending financial houses that have made bad bets have collapsed without much collateral damage all true but the u s economy which has been growing at slower than a pace for the past three quarters wont do much better this quarter or next it isnt showing much momentum yet inflation pressures seem to worry the fed enough to discourage a rate cut business investment spending which was supposed to be rebounding as consumer spending cooled off is surprisingly sluggish fat corporate profit margins seem likely to shrink a development mr greenspan described as "an early sign that we are in the later stages of a cycle " ah the return of the greenspan haiku the spreading subprime mortgage mess raises the ominous prospect of a broader pullback by lenders the sort of change that can slow the economy and make it vulnerable to some other nasty shock its hard to tell in advance what will produce the next recession or when but the past week can be read as a reminder that there will be one as george magnus of ubs investment bank said in a report to clients "were looking at a clock without hands we dont know the time but we know its ticking " mr wessel responds to reader comments at wsj com capitalexchange or email him at capital wsj com
