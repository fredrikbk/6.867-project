politics &amp economics canadas grain growers chafe wheat board tensions stir up issues of money and self determination canadas barley farmers long insulated from the vagaries of global trade by the government backed canadian wheat board will vote next week on whether to break free some farmers view the year old board which buys and sells their product on the world market as inefficient if the barley farmers are allowed to bolt wheat farmers could follow marking the biggest change in canadas huge grain business in three generations farmers like doug mcbain who has harvested barley on acres of high country prairie all his life are among those agitating to leave as global grain prices have climbed in recent years the debate has grown more contentious "where you stand has almost become like a religion " says mr mcbain years old "what i say is if you cant compete on your own get out of the market but dont try and tell me what to do " last year mr mcbain was offered &# a bushel from a chinese distributor for his malt barley he was legally prohibited from selling it himself and instead was required to accept &# from the wheat board which hadnt sold at the top of the market he says he has friends who would like to grow organic barley but because they couldnt sell it for the premium it could command they have little incentive to try in recent weeks long simmering tensions between backers and opponents of the member board have reached a boil some barley farmers have until march to cast their advisory vote on one of three options ditch the board and sell their grain themselves preserve the status quo or remain under the board with the provision that they can opt out polls show less than one third of farmers want to leave things as they stand barley represents about of the wheat boards business but the vote is seen as a bellwether for the nations massive wheat market at the heart of the fight are issues of land rights self determination and money ultimately at stake is the system through which of the worlds durum wheat and of its malting barley will be sold u s grain companies are watching the struggle because they stand to benefit from a more accessible market in canada created the wheat board to insure loans to farmers cooperatives during the great depression about of the countrys wheat and barley for domestic human consumption and export is sold through the board the majority of that harvest is pooled and farmers receive an averaged price for the farmer that means the lows in the market are generally avoided but so are the highs and whether that has meant an overall benefit to the farmer has become a contested issue in the mid s farmers began to challenge what they came to see as over regulation some protested the board by illegally trucking their harvest to the u s and selling for better prices dozens ended up in jail for farmers who want out of the wheat board which now sells about &# billion of grain a year those protesters are seen as freedom fighters to others they are traitors "if you make a decision on your farm that only affects you you get to make it " says kyle korneychuk a wheat board director and saskatchewan farmer who favors maintaining the boards monopoly "but if youre going to do something that affects all the farmers in canada youre going to get pushed back " the board today is more crucial than ever says mr korneychuk as a half dozen multinational agricultural companies like archer daniels midland inc and cargill inc control the lions share of the global grain market "were aware of the controversy but were not lying awake dreaming about it or scheming around it " cargill spokesman robert meijer said "once they make a decision we will work with them whether that be with the board or without the board " last year canadas conservative prime minister stephen harper replaced four of the five government appointed members of the board in their place he selected directors who want to break the boards monopoly "the ultimate aim is to have a strong viable yet voluntary wheat board " said conrad bellehumeur spokesman for agriculture minister chuck strahl "we want to remove the wheat board monopoly and offer farmers the freedom to choose how they market their product " mr korneychuk says that if the board became optional it would lose effectiveness and limp along until it disappears in a few years to that mr mcbain says good riddance his broad stretch of prairie at the feet of the rocky mountains has been painstakingly cultivated by his family since his grandfather immigrated from scotland years ago every slab of timber in the pair of red barns and each furrow in the soil was set in place by a mcbain today the farmer has little patience for anyone telling him what to do or how to do it mr mcbain also says board regulation has stymied local investment he argues that were it not for the board hundreds of millions of dollars would have been invested in canada instead of migrating to the u s mr korneychuk says tens of thousands of farmers have already left their land because they couldnt compete with subsidized u s farmers or the cheap labor available in eastern europe as fixed costs for farmers continue to rise and competition tightens he predicts it will only get worse in the meantime the board has reformed itself and now offers farmers a broader array of options to sell their crop than they had a decade ago after the march vote the debate over whether barley farmers remain under the wheat board will be taken up by the federal government which appears headed toward an election this spring should the conservatives gain a majority in parliament mr bellehumeur the agriculture ministry spokesman said the board will be opened up the battle over wheat is likely to follow "the ultimate goal is to remove the monopoly " he said mr mcbain said he is ready "i dont need a baby sitter " see related letter "letters to the editor barley vote in canada could free up exports" wsj march
