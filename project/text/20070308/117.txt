whats bank of americas real agenda in illegal immigrant offer i am one of those outraged customers of bank of america who vehemently disagrees with kenneth d lewiss granting credit cards to illegal aliens his response to customer complaints in "not in the cards" editorial page feb was about as disingenuous as a ceo of a company can get for him to suggest "the program is not about illegal immigrants" is pure obfuscation at its worst it may not be "about illegal immigrants " but bank of america will benefit financially if it can create a market for illegal immigrants his suggestion that "we have an obligation to serve all of those in our country who are legally eligible" obfuscates the point that bank of america will be serving illegal immigrants while also serving legal ones this is no different than would be the blanket printing of oregon drivers licenses to illegal immigrants i e illegal aliens undocumented workers robin rose corvallis ore mr lewiss defense of his banks policy of granting credit cards to people without credit history highlights the fact that recent immigrants whether legal or illegal enrich our economy a large bank like bank of america offers them credit early in their immigrant status to "strengthen our relationships with individuals and families we hope will become loyal bank of america customers in the future as their financial needs grow " the fact that the bank sees them as being a good financial risk reinforces the impression that they contribute to americas economic growth and that growth enriches all of us elaine jancourtz plainsboro n j thank you for allowing kenneth lewis to plead his case for granting illegal immigrants access to credit cards through his bank you acted in the true spirit of press freedom and i exercising my freedom canceled my &# credit line credit card which i had held since in addition i have canceled all of my bank of america accounts and have elected never to do business with mr lewiss company again freedom is a wonderful thing vincent p a benedict collegeville pa
