allianzs stock those attending the briefing on results rapped their tables in applause but investors are proving to be a tougher audience allianzs shares which trade on the new york stock exchange as well as in europe have declined in recent days as the global market tumble swamped last months good news in germany the stock closed yesterday at euros a share down from a high of euros last month it

cents giving allianz a market value of &# billion allianzs shares which are trading at less than times analysts estimated per share earnings for cheaper than its european peers may reflect broader issues plaguing many in the sector investors have remained wary of giving insurers higher valuations because their operations are benefiting from external factors namely benign claims and markets at least some investors are probably still smarting from the pain that most insurers endured early this decade when they were hit by high claims and the to bear market in addition to those head winds allianz was hurt by its acquisition of dresdner bank mr diekmanns growth goal sounds lofty for a huge company revenue topped billion euros last year a hair above sales a year earlier meanwhile prices for property catastrophe coverage where allianz gets of its operating income are slipping and the financial markets have the jitters even so barring massive catastrophe claims or a prolonged market

investment director covering european insurers for standard life investments in edinburgh scotland which owns a small stake in allianz mr ramos martin believes the insurer can achieve half of its growth goals through continued streamlining "but the market seems to be ignoring that and this creates an opportunity " he adds since taking the reins after the company posted a loss in mr diekmann

lower cost distribution channels such as the internet and allianz affiliated salespeople in insurance agencies or banks the company also is getting an increasing share of its profits from higher margin units like asset management and banking "slowly the other areas are growing into a bigger portion of the business " mr diekmann said "i can very well see within the next five years that
