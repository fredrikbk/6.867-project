honolulus new music festival celebrates a return to romance honolulu an ambitious project that first surfaced publicly with a recording session at a historic hawaiian theater last year came to fruition last week as the return to romance music festival which continues through sunday in honolulu the founders of the day festival are matt catingub leader and namesake of the new piece matt catingub orchestra of hawaii mcooh and "pops" conductor of the honolulu symphony and allen sviridoff his long time manager and producer messrs catingub and sviridoff are probably best known to mainlanders for their collaboration on the soundtrack album for george clooneys film about edward r murrow "good night and good luck " mr catingub not only did the arrangements and played alto saxophone on that soundtrack but also made the ultimate sacrifice cutting his hair short for the first time in years in order to appear in the period film messrs catingub and sviridoff have a five year plan to develop their new festival into a world class international event that will draw romantics from around the world while also showcasing the diversity of talent to be found in hawaii although many visitors already come here anticipating the romantic sound of the hawaiian steel guitar the hula don ho and possibly hawaiian slack key guitar the islands are also home to mainstream jazz rock and pop artists and many hawaiian entertainers are also accomplished pop singers several of these multitalented entertainers grammy award nominees robert cazimero amy hanaialii gilliom raiatea helm and kealii reichel among them are on the bill this week along with a festival closing assortment of national pop stars that includes natalie cole kenny loggins michael mcdonald and "american idol" winner ruben stoddard the hawaii artists are also prominently featured on "return to romance " the cd mr catingub recorded last summer with his orchestra on the stage of the hawaii theatre in downtown honolulu messrs catingub and sviridoff chose the year old theater as their recording "studio" in part for its natural acoustics and in part for its historical significance and recorded the mcooh "live" rather than track by track on the disc mr catingub not only presides as the conductor and arranger but sings and plays the piano and sax additional resident vocalists and musicians are being featured in some of the other festival events and mr catingubs new orchestra also provides employment for symphony musicians other union players and support staff the festivals schedule includes shows in three of honolulus major concert venues blaisdell arena the waikiki shell and the hawaii theatre in the lounges of two of honolulus most luxurious hotels and also on the grounds of iolani palace the home of hawaiis kings and queens until the hawaiian government was overthrown by anti hawaiian conspirators in tickets for the concerts are priced at &# &# and &# plus applicable service fees and a &# theatre restoration fee for shows at the hawaii theatre the show at iolani palace was free in short return to romance is the most ambitious music related undertaking in hawaii since the honolulu international jazz festival was founded by the late abe weinstein in the mid s weinstein a clarinetist and enthusiastic jazz promoter experimented for a time with scheduling events at different venues across honolulu before settling on a less complicated and more conventional event that takes place over several days at one site messrs catingub and sviridoff announced their plans for the festival at a press conference last october that coincided with the release of mr catingubs album which in turn was a preview of the smooth pop sound being featured at the festival mr sviridoff said that the festival was loosely modeled on the newport jazz festival as well as the now defunct kool pacific music festival one of several jazz festivals that came and went in hawaii in the s and s beautiful music aside there are economic aspects to the return to romance festival it might seem logical for artistic purposes that a romance themed event be held in february with the finale scheduled for valentines day but mr sviridoff explained that the producers and their financial backers had decided on march because visitor numbers are relatively high while "romance" appeals to a larger potential audience than "jazz " many hawaii residents are hesitant about going into waikiki the longtime center of hawaiian tourism and so support from visitors and the tourism industry will be essential to the festivals long term success mr sviridoff said the producers would consider moving the festival to another time of year if tourism industry executives wanted to use it as a promotional event to boost visitor numbers in waikiki during a slower period this would be similar to the economic strategy that led to the original aloha week festival being created as a way to draw tourists to waikiki in the early fall aloha week is now the aloha festivals a state wide series of events than run from mid september through mid october boosters of the return to romance music festival say it is possible that it too will eventually grow to include events on some of the other major islands that will hinge on the honolulu promoters success in selling tickets and getting people in the door concerts by stadium acts such as michael jackson janet jackson or the rolling stones can draw fans from japan and the u s mainland but how many jazz and pop acts have similar drawing power messrs catingub and sviridoff have been casting their promotional net in every possible direction tie ins after the release of the "return to romance" album have included the broadcast here of a locally produced "romance in hawaii" television special featuring mr catingub and his mcooh orchestra vocalists amy hanaialii gilliom and jimmy borges and ukulele virtuoso jake shimabukuro mr borges is hawaiis top male jazz vocalist ms gilliom has pop music roots and training but is better known in hawaii as a female falsetto singer a "renewal of the vows" ceremony for some married couples of all ages was part of the program at the free show that opened the festival last week messrs catingub and sviridoff also plan to record and release a new mcooh album each year that will provide additional exposure for the orchestra the festival and traditional american pop music with the "return to romance" album out and the festival up and running the ambitious event is another success for mr catingub the year old who has been a musician nearly all his life made his professional debut at age his mother the late singer mavis rivers appointed him her conductor when she played a jazz concert at the waikiki shell in mr catingub currently enjoys parallel careers as a "pops" conductor in hawaii and elsewhere and as a recording artist for concord records he responded to the last "swing dance" craze by forming and recording with the big kahuna &amp the copa cat pack swing band in honolulu mr catingub has broadened the honolulu symphonys "pops" schedule to include contemporary acts ranging from elvis costello and toto to the temptations and the captain &amp tennille while also featuring a roster of hawaiian artists now with his new matt catingub orchestra of hawaii and the return to romance music festival as a showcase he hopes to reacquaint contemporary audiences with the long lost sound of romantic pop music performed by a full orchestra and if all goes according to plan the festival will become an important annual event in the islands music calendar mr berger has been covering hawaiis entertainment scene since
