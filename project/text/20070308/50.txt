gitmos guerrilla lawyers he was the first american to die in what some have called "the real war " johnny "mike" spann the year old cia paramilitary commando was interrogating prisoners in an open courtyard at the qala i jangi fortress in afghanistan when the uprising of hard core taliban and al qaeda fighters began spann emptied his rifle then his sidearm then fought hand to hand as he was swarmed by raging prisoners screaming "allahu akbar " the bloody siege by northern alliance and u s forces went on for several days only ending when of the remaining jihadi fighters were smoked out of a basement where they had retreated and where they murdered a red cross worker who had gone in to check on their condition spann a former marine is credited with saving the lives of countless alliance fighters and afghan civilians by standing and firing as they ran for cover his beaten and booby trapped body was recovered with two bullet wounds in his head the angle of trajectory suggesting he had been shot execution style one of the committed jihadis who came out of that basement wounded and unrepentant was "american taliban" john walker lindh now serving a year sentence in a federal prison another who was shot during the uprising and pulled out of the basement along with lindh was nasser nijer naser al mutairi today the year old is living somewhere in kuwait a free man the true story of mr mutairis journey from the uprising in qala i jangi to guantanamo bays military detention camp to the privileged life of an affluent kuwaiti citizen is one that his team of high priced lawyers and the government of kuwait doesnt want you to know his case reveals a disturbing counterpoint to the false narrative advanced by gitmo lawyers and human rights groups which holds that the guantanamo bay detainees are innocent victims of circumstance swept up in the angry anti muslim fervor that followed the attacks of september then abused and brutally tortured at the hands of the u s military mr mutairi was among kuwaitis picked up in afghanistan and detained at guantanamo bay in their families retained tom wilner and the prestigious law firm of shearman &amp sterling early that same year arguably it is mr wilners aggressive representation along with the determined efforts of the kuwait government that has had the greatest influence in the outcome of all the enemy combatant cases in the court of law and in the court of public opinion the lawsuit filed on their behalf renamed rasul v bush when three cases were joined is credited with opening the door for the blizzard of litigation that followed according to michael ratner the radical lawyer and head of the center for constitutional rights ccr the center received pieces of hate mail when the organization filed the very first guantanamo detainee case in february of the shocking images of were still fresh it would be three more months until most human remains and rubble would be cleared from ground zero there was no interest in guantanamo from the lawyers at premium law firms but by when the first of three detainee cases was heard by the u s supreme court the national climate had changed the country was politically divided the presidential election was in full swing and john kerry was talking about treating terrorism like a criminal nuisance the guantanamo cases gave lawyers a chance to take a swipe at the presidents policies give heroic speeches about protecting the rights of indigents and be a part of the kind of landmark legal cases that come along once in a lifetime the guantanamo bay bar increased from a lonely band of activist lawyers operating out of a run down office in greenwich village to an association of lawyers said mr ratner about the blue chip firms that initially shunned these cases "you had to beat the lawyers off with a stick " mr wilner and his colleagues at shearman &amp sterling were the exception although he has been exceedingly coy about the true nature of his firms role unlike the many lawyers who later joined in the litigation on a pro bono basis shearman &amp sterling was handsomely paid mr wilner has repeatedly stated that the detainees families insisted on paying shearman &amp sterling for its services and that the fees it earned have been donated to an unspecified related charity according to one news report the families had spent &# million in legal fees by mid in truth kuwaiti officials confirmed that the government was footing the bills how did shearman &amp sterling get tapped for this historic assignment speaking at seton hall law school in fall of mr wilner recounted that he visited the facility at guantanamo bay in months before he met the kuwaiti s families what was mr wilner doing at gitmo more than two years before rasul established the legal basis for lawyers getting access to detainees inside the camp one of his gitmo legal colleagues has said that mr wilner was brought into the case by an oil industry client it turns out that shearman &amp sterling a lawyer firm with offices in cities all over the world has substantial business dealings on six continents indeed shearmans client care for middle eastern matters has established a new industry standard the firms abu dhabi office states that it has pioneered the concept of "shariah compliant" financing in kuwait the firm has represented the government on a wide variety of matters involving billions of dollars worth of assets so the party underwriting the litigation on behalf of the kuwaiti from which all of the detainees have benefited is one of shearman &amp sterlings most lucrative opec accounts shearman &amp sterling did far more than just write legal briefs and shuttle down to gitmo to conduct interviews about alleged torture for the bbc in addition to its legal services the firm registered as an agent of a foreign principal under the foreign agents registration act of fara as well as the lobbying disclosure act of lda to press the kuwaiti detainees cause on capitol hill shearman reported &# in lobbying fees under fara for one six month period in and another &# under the lda over a one year period between and those are the precise time periods when congress was engaged in intense debates over the detainee treatment act and the military commissions act legislation which shearman &amp sterling and its kuwaiti paymasters hoped would pave the way for shutting down guantanamo permanently and setting their clients free mr wilner a media savvy lawyer who immediately realized that the detainee cases posed a tremendous pr challenge in the wake of september hired high stakes media guru richard levick to change public perception about the kuwaiti mr levick a former attorney whose washington d c based "crisis pr" firm has carved out a niche in litigation related issues has represented clients as varied as rosie odonnell napster and the roman catholic church mr levicks firm is also registered under fara as an agent of a foreign principal for the "kuwaiti detainees committee " reporting &# in fees in a one year period after the u s supreme court heard the first consolidated case the pr campaign went into high gear mr levick wrote to "turn the guantanamo tide " in numerous published articles and interviews mr levick has laid out the essence of the entire kuwaiti pr campaign the strategy sought to accomplish two things put a sympathetic "human face" on the detainees and convince the public that it had a stake in their plight in other words the militant islamists who traveled to afghanistan to become a part of al qaedas jihad on america had to be reinvented as innocent charity workers swept up in the war after the committed islamist who admitted firing an ak in a taliban training camp became a "teacher on vacation" who went to afghanistan in "to help refugees " the member of an islamist street gang who opened three al wafa offices with suliman abu ghaith osama bin ladens chief spokesman to raise al qaeda funds became a charity worker whose eight children were left destitute in his absence all kuwaitis became the innocent victims of "bounty hunters " a montreal based marketing firm was hired to create the families full service web site which fed propaganda unsourced unrebutted and uninvestigated by the media aimed at the media all over the world creating what mr levick calls a "war of pictures " the site is replete with images meant to appeal to americans smiling kuwaiti families wearing t shirts and baseball caps cute children passing out yellow ribbons after the rasul decision the pr momentum picked up speed and the supreme court became in mr levicks words their "main weapon " a "cudgel" that forced more attention in what he calls the traditional "liberal" press dozens of op eds by mr wilner and the family group leader described as a u s trained former kuwaiti air force pilot who cherishes the memory of drinking coca cola were aimed at the public and congress mr levick maintains that a year and a half after they began the campaign their pr outreach produced literally thousands of news placements and that eventually a majority of the top newspapers were editorializing on the detainees behalf convinced that judges can be influenced by aggressive pr campaigns mr levick points to rulings in the detainee cases which openly cite news stories that resulted from his teams media outreach the kuwaiti case is a primer on the anatomy of a guerilla pr offensive packaged and sold to the public as a fight for the "rule of law" and "americas core principles " begin with flimsy information generate stories that are spun from uncorroborated double or triple hearsay uttered by interested parties that are hard to confirm from halfway around the world feed the phonied up stories to friendly media who write credulous reports and emotional human interest features post them on a web site where they will then be read and used as sources by other lazy or busy media from all over the world in short create one giant echo chamber mr mutairis profile is the most brazen example of mr levicks confidence that the media can be easily manipulated the web site describes him as a member of an apolitical and peaceful sect of missionaries and that he went to afghanistan in october of to "minister in the small mosques and schools" in the countrys poorer regions everything mr levick did was in partnership with tom wilner and the law firm of sherman &amp sterling it was their joint litigation pr plan with the guantanamo lawsuits helping the pr messaging and the pr messaging helping the lawsuits all of this may be legal but it is hardly ethical shearman &amp sterling lawyers arent hucksters crassly promoting a cheap product they are sworn officers of the court volunteering to represent alien enemy combatants in a time of war interjecting themselves in cases that affect how american soldiers on the battlefield do their job it is one thing to take these cases in order to achieve the proper balance between due process concerns and unprecedented national security issues it is another to hire pr and marketing consultants to create image makeovers for suspected al qaeda financiers foot soldiers weapons trainers and bomb makers all of which is financed by millions of dollars from a foreign country enmeshed in the anti american anti israel elements of middle east politics although a few mistakes were made when some of the guantanamo detainees were taken into custody in the fog of war others were indisputably captured with ak s still smoking in their hands any one of those who have been properly classified in combat status review tribunals as an unlawful enemy combatant could be the next mohamed atta or hani hanjour who if captured in the summer of would have been described by these lawyers as a quiet engineering student from hamburg and a nice saudi kid who dreams of learning to fly how we deal with alien enemy combatants goes to the essence of the debate between those who see terrorism as a series of criminal acts that should be litigated in the justice system one attack at a time and those who see it as a global war where the "criminal paradigm" is no more effective against militant islamists whose chief tactic is mass murder than indictments would have been in stopping hitlers march across europe michael ratner and the lawyers in the gitmo bar have expressly stated that the habeas corpus lawsuits are a tactic to prevent the u s military from doing its job he has bragged that "the litigation is brutal you cant run an interrogation with attorneys " no you cant lawyers can literally get us killed we may never know how many of the hundreds of repatriated detainees are back in action fighting the u s or our allies thanks to the efforts of the guantanamo bay bar approximately former detainees have been confirmed as having returned to the battlefield of them killed by u s forces of the eight detainees who were rendered back to kuwait for review of their cases all were acquitted in criminal proceedings including mr mutairi who has given press interviews admitting that he was shot in the november uprising at qala i jangi only one kuwaiti adel al zamel has been sent to prison for crimes committed before his work with al wafa in afghanistan a member of an islamist gang that stalked videotaped and savagely beat "adulterers " he was sentenced to a year in prison in for attacking a coed sitting in her car these are some of the men tom wilner was talking about when he went on national television and said with a straight face "my guys loved the united states " the guy who really loved the united states stood and fought to protect us from radical islamists rather than enable them in his job application for the cia mike spann wrote "i am an action person that feels personally responsible for making any changes in this world that are in my power because if i dont no one else will " we owe our unqualified support and steadfastness to the warriors who take personal responsibility when no one else will allowing lawyers to subvert the truth and transform the constitution into a lethal weapon in the hands of our enemies while casting themselves as patriots makes a mockery of the sacrifices made by true patriots like mike spann if sens patrick leahy and arlen specter chairman and ranking members respectively of the senate judiciary committee succeed in their plan to turn enemy combatant cases over to the federal courts we will sorely rue the day that we eliminated "lawyer free zones " ms burlingame a former attorney and a director of the world trade center memorial foundation is the sister of charles f "chic" burlingame iii
