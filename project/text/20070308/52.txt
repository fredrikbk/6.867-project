helicopter firms press air force to rebid project lockheed martin corp and united technologies corp stepped up pressure on the air force to seek new bids for a multibillion dollar rescue helicopter program after the government accountability office said the contract was improperly awarded to boeing co the gao congresss investigative arm which upheld protests by lockheed and united technologies sikorsky helicopter unit last week recommended that the air force solicit fresh bids air force officials have resisted suggesting they can resolve the matter without a new competition the timing of the gaos rebuke is particularly problematic because air force officials are concerned about the credibility of their acquisition team as the service prepares to evaluate bids in a far more complex competition for aerial refueling planes sikorsky and lockheed yesterday stepped up calls for a new competition as the only way to address flight performance criteria the gao didnt consider "we believe the errors committed by the air force in those other areas are highly material and we intend to pursue them vigorously if the corrective action taken by the air force does not adequately address them " sikorsky wrote in a statement the gaos decision was based only on its finding that the air force didnt properly evaluate costs of operating and maintaining the rescue helicopters over the life of the program the gao said it didnt address the many other challenges lodged by lockheed and sikorsky which offered smaller newer designs although protest documents are proprietary sikorsky said it "is fully prepared if the other parties to the protest agree to the public release of all the pleadings that were submitted to the gao" to bolster its case lockheed spokesman greg caires said "because the gao did not find it necessary to rule on the merits of each of the concerns we raised in our protest we believe a full and open re competition is the most appropriate path forward " boeing said that it is reviewing the gao report and still believes its helicopter is the most capable for the rescue mission although sikorsky makes the helicopters used by the air force lockheed had been considered the front runner because it was bidding with the same model chosen by the navy as the new u s presidential helicopter but the gao report revealed that problems on the presidential helicopter tilted the air force against lockheed mr caires said the program is on track and the air forces evaluation "is no longer current " the air force didnt have an immediate comment on the detailed gao decision
