no wool gathering at this jam session new york its hard to believe that a movement that nurtured the likes of bill frisell john zorn dave douglas and other astonishingly inventive musicians exists only on the fringe but most performers and composers who are identified with new yorks so called downtown scene at the heart of which was adventurous often avant garde modern music still function well outside the mainstream on march a few of the better known musicians who emerged from and influenced that scene performed at town hall here the concert was billed as a benefit for the stone a downtown not for profit performance space but it was in fact a salute to the glory days of the knitting factory the scenes de facto base which opened years ago last month a disagreement between the knitting factorys current management and its co founder and board member michael dorf over whether to celebrate the clubs past prevented a formal commemoration at least according to mr dorf demonstrating the hustler spirit that defines his career as a music entrepreneur mr dorf put together the town hall show gathering together laurie anderson don byron joe lovano billy martin john medeski sonic youths lee ranaldo lou reed marc ribot mr zorn and others for what he called a "celebration of the old knit " what made the knitting factory special in its heyday of the late s and early s was mr dorfs willingness to permit just about any kind of music to grace its stage including nontraditional jazz assertive rock hybrids quasi classical music and other sub genres that seemed to bridle against buttoned down jazz punks lack of musicianship and bland backward looking rock "a little bubble of peace for experimental music" is how dj spooky described the knitting factory at town hall though much of the music was far from peaceful his set on this night featured mr ranaldo dragging his guitar across the stage playing it with a shredded bow and drumsticks and issuing ear piercing blitzes of feedback that were prototypical of one old knit branch of music when a film spooky brought along failed to appear on the screen above the stage computer error messages that flashed instead seemed like commentary the evening was a joyous mess "this is going to be like chinese water torture " announced singer jennifer charles before the shows less than all star finale a screeching poorly executed rendition of "sgt peppers lonely hearts club band " the beatles tune was chosen for the lyrics "it was years ago today " a decision that lacked the irony rich wit of the knitting factory at its best and messrs byron lovano reed and zorn were wise to stand aside but on this rainy night when the town hall stage resembled the site of a fire drill as musicians raced around to perform in various lineups there was much to remind us of the downtown scenes vitality and its blurring of the lines between various musical forms supported by a cello viola and a rock rhythm section violinist rebecca moore performed a piece that might be described as bjoerk meets henryk gorecki marcus rojas played be bop riffs and punchy funk on tuba tapping its bell now and then for added percussion mr ribots guitar work ranged from pure dissonance to lucid fluidity often within four bars mr lovano who has a strong following among followers of traditional mainstream jazz honed his skills at the old knit his appearances with mr frisell and drummer paul motian are almost as legendary among knitting factory fans as mr zorns with his naked city bands in a piece of knotty free jazz he performed at town hall with roy nathanson on alto saxophone and mr byron on clarinet he showed what he learned from ornette coleman abandoning the warm round tone of his recent work and flying into the hemisphere with a series of squeaks and squawks the solo by mr byron a musician whose excellence has yet to deliver him the wider audience he deserves was too short by at least half and i found myself hoping he and mr lovano would return though they didnt they set the bar high for the artists that followed mr reed exceeded the standard performing with guitarist mark rathke cellist jane scarpantoni and for the first time mr zorn on alto sax mr reed revived two songs from his album "ecstasy " the makeshift unit coalesced almost immediately and mr reed seemed to know it punctuating his vocal with broad animated gestures and adding a nasty tone to his customary clean electric guitar sound the music grew increasingly hypnotic and when the second song "rock minuet " ended mr reed blew mr zorn a kiss the two men so important to new yorks music scene for decades hugged in celebration the rest of the evening was spotty though not without its successes bassist oren bloedow filled in for the absent chris wood playing with mr martin and mr medeski the kind of jam jazz for which medeski martin and wood is admired and guitarist gary lucas and bassist trevor dunn made the sheets of gruff frenetic noise that redefines hard hitting rock but mike doughty former leader of soul coughing who once worked the door at the knitting factory did a pedestrian three song set of folk rock that had me hoping mr dorf would pull the plug and there were no memorable keyboard performances save mr medeskis noodling considering that wayne horvitz uri caine and cecil taylor played the club and are among the influences on many of its notable musicians it was an oversight but had the concert been less chaotic and less imperfect the show wouldve been contrary to the spirit of mr dorfs old knit which encouraged experimentation and abandon thus on this night there was much happiness out on the fringe mr fusilli writes about rock and pop music for the journal
