review &amp outlook editorial liberating heathrow the wright brothers didnt fly an a at kitty hawk and it was unrealistic to expect the u s and the european union to liberalize their aviation market rules in one fell swoop but the "open skies" deal tentatively reached friday and still subject to approval by congress and the eus member states would clearly open up trans atlantic travel to more competition the best evidence of progress is that the loudest squeals are coming from the companies with the most to gain by keeping the old restrictive policies first among the whiners is british airways which has long fought to keep londons heathrow airport mostly closed to trans atlantic competition only ba virgin atlantic american airlines and united are now allowed to fly between the u s and heathrow a favorite gateway to europe among americans under the new pact heathrow would have to allow trans atlantic flights by any u s or eu airline british airways claims brussels got too little for what some believe is the eus best bargaining chip in particular washington wont make significant changes in foreign ownership limits on u s carriers the deal would allow non americans to buy more than of u s airlines but it would still limit their voting rights to that effectively eliminates the appeal of such mergers for europeans because they wouldnt have enough control to force through the kind of changes that many u s carriers need to become profitable unions and congressional protectionists are largely to blame here u s airlines are one of the few american industries with labor deals that put them at a competitive disadvantage even compared with europe one reason some american carriers increasingly focus on international routes is that with low fare airlines eating their lunch at home long haul routes lower their overall per mile labor costs yet the unions dont want to see someone else come in and force any changes members of congress who think its in the u s national interest to preserve american ownership of these carriers are actually harming the u s industry permitting cross border airline mergers would allow u s operators greater flexibility in seeking potential partners and making these new companies as competitive as possible besides why should congress object if richard bransons virgin brand wants to start an american airline that serves american travelers and employs american workers this is a reminder that protectionism isnt only a european disease european airlines shouldnt be too glum about the deal however theres still plenty of consolidation to be done just on the continent and this pact would help facilitate that by allowing any eu airline to fly to the u s from any member state not just its home country having a stable of healthy european carriers large enough to compete with one another in a variety of markets rather than each nations flag carrier cornering most of its home turf will be good for the industry and air travelers alike this open skies deal isnt perfect and the two sides ought to continue moving toward true liberalization but any opening in the aviation cartel will be good for passengers on both sides of the atlantic
