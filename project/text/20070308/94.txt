riding with the top down convertible bonds could gain appeal if volatility persists new york while stock investors did their best to simply hold on during last weeks stock swings many convertible bond investors were enjoying the ride some believe last weeks drop and subsequent rally in the stock market may portend a broader return of volatility which has been largely absent in recent months given the appetite for such volatility often associated with convertible bond investors particularly hedge funds a comeback of sharp swings in stock values could galvanize the convertibles market on wednesday last week as most eyes were on the stock markets response to its tuesday afternoon plummet the convertibles market recorded its highest trading activity since at least the beginning of according to trace trade reporting and compliance engine data compiled by the national association of securities dealers two medtronic inc convertible issues were among the days five most actively traded issues gaining between half a point and points according to trace followed by two amgen inc issues that each fell less than a point "the volatility caused some dislocation and you saw guys repositioning their portfolios " said jonathan cunningham director of convertibles at jefferies &amp co "you saw outright investors taking advantage of pricing changes to get in on new investments and it gave the hedge fund community the chance to take some profits on their positions " hedge funds in particular like to employ a common arbitrage strategy of buying a companys convertible bonds and selling short an equivalent amount of the companys common stock a bet that can pay off when the shares fall investors who use this strategy often talk in terms of the hedge ratio which measures the relationship between the bonds conversion value and the stock price and allows arbitrage funds to calibrate their exposure to movement in the common stock price what constitutes bad news for shares can be good news for convertibles the stock market has been particularly harsh to companies with exposure to subprime loans since those loans have begun to default more but according to one convertibles investor the movement in those stocks make them increasingly attractive to convertible arbitragers who are willing to overlook a weakening of a companys credit standing as long as they dont believe the company is at risk of going bankrupt typically stock volatility and bond valuations move hand in hand according to paul berkman a convertibles analyst with j giordano securities for convertibles he said higher volatility usually is good while widening credit risk premiums generally are bad "some convertibles are more sensitive to one or the other " mr berkman said "within the convertibles market there is a spectrum of risk and its important to be in the right kind of convertible with the right kind of sensitivity " he noted that most of last weeks interest was in higher grade shorter duration convertibles which he points out are more sensitive to stock moves than to widening credit spreads mr cunningham said that while riskier credits held up reasonably well last week they were outperformed by investment grade credits partly as a result of the general flight to quality that took place in addition stock volatility underscores the role of convertible bonds as a natural haven from share downside risk as convertibles give investors the option to convert their bonds to stock under certain conditions "long before hedge funds people bought convertibles because of the downside protection " mr berkman said "when equities get hit prices go down but theres more confidence in convertibles because theres more downside protection " while mr cunningham said that the increase in volatility could help companies get better pricing on new issues he said it is unclear whether the recent sharp moves will impact either new convertible issuance or the broader convertibles market "theres sort of a cautious tone to the market overall " mr cunningham said "its too early to tell if theres going to be any dramatic sustained impact for convertibles " beige book outlook gives treasurys a boost a federal reserve report detailing tepid economic activity helped treasury prices rise the fed in its beige book report described the u s s recent economic activity as "modest" in its pace amid little change in inflation pressures market gains were "pretty clearly a response to the slightly weaker beige book " said john canavan market strategist with stone &amp mccarthy research associates the placid trading seen for most of the session came on a day when there was little other significant economic data to capture the markets attention meanwhile major u s stock indexes fell only modestly investors ignored the threat of a rate increase from federal reserve bank of chicago president michael moskow who will retire later this year mr moskow said "my assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high during the forecast period is greater than the risk of growth falling too low " he reiterated his recent belief that "some additional firming of policy may yet be necessary to address this inflation risk " in late trade the benchmark year note was up point or &# per &# face value at its yield fell to from tuesday as yields move
