options fines a hard call the securities and exchange commission is struggling to answer what it says is a surprisingly tough question how much were companies and their shareholders hurt when executives stock options were backdated sec chairman christopher cox and his four fellow commissioners are wrestling with the issue as they try to figure out whether and how harshly to penalize companies where backdating occurred the behind the scenes struggle has delayed a formal commission vote on a proposed &# million settlement that the agencys staff reached with brocade communications systems inc a year ago in one of the first cases dealing solely with backdating at first blush the issue seems simple had options not been backdated executives would have made less money and companies presumably would have made more money thereby benefiting shareholders but the sec says figuring out exactly how shareholders were harmed is tricky and deciding whether to fine the companies is even trickier "we are relying heavily upon the resources of the office of economic analysis and our chief economist " mr cox says declining to comment on any specific case "each case rather obviously will turn on some facts so well take them one at a time as they come " many companies grant executives options to purchase stock at a specific price as part of their compensation generally the price is the trading price on the date of the grant by backdating those grants to a point when the stock price was lower executives can potentially buy shares more cheaply some companies are being investigated for possible backdating improprieties pressure to resolve backdating cases stepped up last week when two democratic lawmakers who serve on a house committee that oversees the sec wrote a letter to mr cox criticizing the slow pace of enforcement actions in backdating cases in recent years the sec has been divided on when and how to punish companies involved in financial frauds republicans on the commission generally voted against penalties in such cases arguing that if shareholders were harmed by executives fraud they shouldnt be harmed a second time by requiring the company to pay a fine democrats generally voted for penalties contending they were appropriate for wrongdoing backdating cases are similar in some respects and can be measured by the same two step test that the sec often uses in other fraud cases the first is to look at what happens to a stock when alleged fraud or fraud investigation comes to light if the price drops that suggests investors considered the information pertinent the second step is to see if a company used the inflated stock to buy another company or raise money which suggests that the company as a whole and its shareholders benefited warranting a possible fine but backdating cases also present unique questions among them were executives compensated differently than shareholders believed is there a value to the company of using backdated options to attract and retain employees did a stock decline triggered by the disclosure of backdated options reflect damage done to the company by the backdating or was it caused by fear of litigation or potential impact on corporate officers do investors consider restatements involving options which dont involve an expenditure of cash relevant if the answers indicate the company benefited from the backdating that could support a penalty brocade first disclosed in early january that it would have to restate fiscal and results to reflect additional option related compensation expenses the san jose networking storage company said it had incorrectly accounted for grants to new hires as made on the date they accepted an offer rather than the date they started work brocade shares fell the day of its announcement in may when brocade announced the justice department had joined the sec in an investigation its stock fell less than a spokeswoman for brocade says the company is cooperating in the sec and justice department probes initially sec economists determined that brocade itself had benefited from the backdating during the period that brocade is alleged to have backdated options it used million shares to fund its acquisition of rhapsody networks the economists were told by mr cox to probe further and consider other factors including those that could offset gains to the company principles for determining when to sanction a company with a penalty which mr cox persuaded the commission to agree to in january include whether the company improperly benefited as a result of the conduct or if shareholders were victimized but commissioners arent bound by the principles when they vote brocade announced it struck a tentative &# million settlement with the sec staff in february the next month the sum was increased to &# million with no explanation that amounts to of the companys net income although brocade agreed to settle the sec civil case in an unusual move it also submitted a report in which it said an economic analysis found that the company didnt benefit according to a person familiar with the case brocade declined to comment on the paper brocade shares which dropped from its first warning of an options related earnings restatement to an intraday low of &# in november closed yesterday at &# which is even higher than the price just before its first options announcement that could raise another question how important was the backdating to brocade if the stock recovered some sec insiders believe mr cox wants to ensure the commissions unanimous vote by developing an analysis that can withstand scrutiny and serve as a template for future penalty decisions meanwhile many of the backdating cases are running up against a statute of limitations which is five years for securities fraud while the sec could still seek disgorgement of any ill gotten gains and injunctions against future behavior a delay could limit the commissions ability to seek a penalty "i think this is all part of an effort to give empirical support to one point of view or another " says ralph ferrara a former sec general counsel now in private practice and defending corporate clients in options backdating cases not including brocade mr ferrara says its impossible to precisely calculate the impact on an individual company "the more fundamental issue isnt what happens with brocade or what they do with the penalty its how the commission deals with the companies and how they distinguish one from another " potential settlements in other cases have been put off as government attorneys and defense lawyers wait to see where the commission will come out on brocade other companies that have reached settlements with the sec staff havent yet gotten commission approval analog devices inc one of the companies under investigation for backdating had a tentative &# million settlement with the sec in november but that has been on hold since federal prosecutors became interested in the case early last year mercury interactive corp in september said it proposed to the sec staff that it pay &# million to settle its backdating case the staff agreed to recommend the deal to the full commission the company said that case is still pending
