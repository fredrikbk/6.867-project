another dead journalist on friday russian journalist ivan safronov fell to his death from the fourth floor window of his moscow apartment building russian authorities have already ruled out foul play given the trend of russian politics in recent years with its trail of blood and bodies that judgment cant be taken at face value safronov was no ordinary journalist and the manner of his death was equally unusual as defense correspondent for the kommersant newspaper he reported last year on the third consecutive failed test launch of russias latest submarine based nuclear missile reportedly infuriating russian defense officials more recently according to kommersant safronov was investigating russian sales of missiles and advanced fighter jets to iran and syria via belarus for which russian authorities had threatened him with a criminal investigation as for his death it seems safronov was returning to his apartment from grocery shopping oranges were found in the buildings stairwell he was and thought to be in good health russian authorities have speculated he might have committed suicide though no suicide note was found had safronovs death been the first of its kind there might have been reason to credit an innocent explanation yet as the committee to protect journalists notes journalists have been murdered in russia since vladimir putin became president in some of them such as anna politkovskaya of novaya gazeta who was gunned down in october were well known opponents of mr putin others such as iskandar khatloni of radio free europe had reported human rights abuses committed in chechnya still others particularly forbess paul klebnikov had investigated the dealings of russias new tycoons in few of these cases have authorities even arrested a suspect not one has resulted in a conviction the russian government has sometimes claimed that the likely culprits are "chechen terrorists " that squares oddly with the fact that in many cases the murdered journalists were known to have been investigating corporate or political corruption at the time of their deaths it also squares oddly with the threats and attacks these journalists suffered before being killed politkovskaya for example fell violently ill in after drinking a cup of tea while en route to reporting on the beslan school massacre and the botched rescue effort this is not to say that the hand of mr putin can be detected in all or even any of these murders some of which involved provincial journalists chasing local stories what is true is that the kremlin has declared open season on its critics last summer mr putins rubber stamp parliament adopted a law allowing russian law enforcement agents and special forces to kill "extremists" wherever they might be found the definition of "extremist" being broadened potentially to include any critic of the government as one russian journalist told us "kommersant remains one of the last remnants of the free press in russia relatively critical of the putin regime ivan safronovs publications cannot go unnoticed by those who carry on the new anti extremist law " much the same goes for last novembers murder in london of alexander litvinenko from his death bed the poisoned litvinenko blamed mr putin personally for his killing scotland yard investigators have since found traces of polonium everywhere a russian businessman named andrei logovoi went in europe including a british airways jet and a soccer stadium mr logovoi is a former kgb bodyguard and met with litvinenko just before he fell ill last week paul joyal an american expert on the kgb was shot outside his suburban maryland home only four days earlier mr joyal had told nbcs dateline that "a message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the kremlin if you do no matter who you are where you are we will find you and we will silence you in the most horrible way possible " mr joyals shooting may have nothing to do with his political views but the frequency with which kremlin critics get badly hurt makes it impossible to rule anything out also last week chess champion garry kasparov led a protest against mr putin in st petersburg probably the largest of its kind in recent years it was violently dispersed by the police a witness tells us that many of those arrested remain in police custody as much as the suspicious killings this sort of brutish reaction to a peaceful protest suggests the kind of country russia has become under mr putin without any firm signals of opposition from western leaders who have done so much to court him president bush not least mr putin and his successors will have little incentive to change course
