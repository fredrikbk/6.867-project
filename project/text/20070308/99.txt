skimming devices target debit card readers thieves are installing them to steal customers data then empty bank accounts to prevent thieves from stealing credit and debit card information stop &amp shop supermarkets make a point of never storing the data after shoppers swipe their cards at the cash register the information is transmitted to an outside company for processing but the ahold nv unit and its customers learned last month that such precautions dont guarantee that the data are secure police say debit card information belonging to more than shoppers was intercepted by thieves who surreptitiously replaced some of stop &amp shops card swipe devices with their own systems which were equipped with electronic recording units called "skimmers " before the criminals were caught more than &# in fraudulent atm withdrawals had been made the brazen data breach highlights a serious vulnerability in the retailing world computerized cash registers known as point of sale or pos terminals thieves can use "skimming" devices generally circuit boards or hand held wireless units to steal payment card data off card swipe machines once the information is pilfered it can either be used to make counterfeit cards or sold to other criminals at times the skimming devices are also installed in atms though atm scams are more likely to involve cameras experts say that pos related data fraud is far more common than the kind of breach reported recently by tjx corp in which hackers infiltrated the off price retailers central computer database and stole data from thousands of customers pos fraud also occurs more frequently than so called phishing scams in which internet users are tricked into giving up their credit card and other financial information a recent study by gartner inc analyst avivah litan found that of card data breaches are tied to cash register and other pos terminals robert mccullen chief executive of ambirontrustwave holdings a chicago based security firm that has serviced about businesses says that in the past two years it has handled more than incidents of pos breaches and that its cases in doubled from the previous year in the few cases that dont involve skimming stored data thefts are often to blame even though storing unprotected customer data violates credit card company regulations in addition stores with systems connected to the internet sometimes fail to change vendor provided generic passwords or to install firewalls or antivirus protection to guard against hackers one reason pos machines are so vulnerable is that nearly all of the estimated million devices in the u s employ a year old magnetic stripe technology that industry experts say is largely defenseless against the high tech wizardry available to fraudsters today these experts say that thieves can buy skimming gadgetry on the open market "right now you can walk into a computer store in malaysia and buy one of these devices for about &# " says kiran gandhi vice president of business at magtek a carson calif maker of card security equipment magnetic stripe technology was invented by international business machines corp for the central intelligence agency which used it for building entry cards the banking industry adopted the technology in the s while magnetic stripes are inexpensive to produce about cents a card they contain only enough storage space for a name and a few numbers "for the bad guys magnetic stripes and pins equal a pot of gold " says gartners ms litan in november thieves made more than &# in unauthorized cash withdrawals from atms at casinos in las vegas using stolen debit card numbers and pins the u s secret service determined the cards had been compromised at two service stations in costa mesa calif police suspect that the skimming devices were planted in pin pads at the pumps at night while the stations were closed in october eight people were arrested in los angeles in connection with a scheme to skim more than &# million from wells fargo &amp co and washington mutual inc cardholders skimmers used at several restaurants including the cheesecake factory and t g i fridays were found to be the source of the breach according to agents participating in an investigative effort dubbed operation french fry while the skimmers may have collected data from both credit and debit cards almost all of the fraudulent transactions involved debit cards thieves typically prefer debit card frauds because credit cards are more closely monitored by banks and they can obtain the pins more easily manufacturers of pos machines have added security features to newer pos systems including antitampering devices that quickly delete data akin to a self destroying "mission impossible" tape or shut down a system in the event of an unauthorized entry but many companies are still using older machines the systems employed by stop &amp shop are years old says grant drummond marketing head of ingenico which made the swipe box systems for the supermarket chain ingenico stopped making those systems in and the data thieves at stop &amp shop most likely wouldnt have been able to pull off their caper with ingenicos newer systems mr drummond says but he notes that "there are no recalls of previous generation or outdated systems in the point of sale industry " stop &amp shop declined to comment on the case two years ago the secret service busted a ring masterminded by two individuals in miami who stole more than &# million by skimming data and creating fake cards "we have a robust effort to combat payment card fraud " says jeffrey gilbert assistant special agent in charge of the secret services miami office "but skimming continues to be a challenge because crooks find it much more attractive than walking into a bank and robbing it " in the stop &amp shop case police say that late at night after shopping crowds had thinned and the staff was whittled to a skeletal crew four young men entered several stores in rhode island and massachusetts distracted employees and replaced several card swiping machines with devices that looked similar the thieves systems however housed mini circuit boards that recorded customers data and pins a few days later the suspects retrieved the systems counterfeit debit cards were quickly made using the collected financial data and disseminated along with the related pins on the black market within days more than &# was withdrawn from atms as far away as california secret service affidavits describe the four suspects who are now being held in rhode island as young men in their s of armenian descent with california residences their downfall came one night last week after they returned to replace one of the card swipe devices at a hour store in coventry r i an employee recognized the men from surveillance camera photos taken at the store and distributed by police says marcos saenko a coventry police detective "the unique thing about the circuit boards was that the transactions still went through" to the card processor says thomas powers head of the u s secret service in providence as a result neither the stores nor the customers knew anything was amiss until the banks notified customers of what appeared to be unauthorized withdrawals from their accounts it appears that the suspects may have gotten away with similar skimming capers in several other cities including philadelphia miami las vegas and richmond va police say "they all have the same kind of modus operandi attacking the pos system " says rhode island attorney general patrick lynch
