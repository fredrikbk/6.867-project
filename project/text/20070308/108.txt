barred from representing himself at his original trial in he earned a law degree since then mr wiesner has been battling for the right to practice law professionally in new york mr wiesner has cited his undergraduate degree and law degree from state funded universities internships with a state judge and a district attorney and a recommendation from a retired federal judge new york state has refused to admit him to the bar nine times because of his prison record the nature of his crime and what it considers his lack of remorse mr wiesners campaign brings into sharp relief a central question of criminal justice what is redemption "i had some serious offenses years ago and theres no taking it back " says mr wiesner years old "who among us would like to go through life being judged every day by our worst act " bar admission standards vary from state to state and can be applied differently within the same state the issue gets especially thorny with ex convicts indiana mississippi missouri oregon and texas prohibit felons from practicing law alabama allows felons to practice only if theyve received a full pardon like most states new york requires bar applicants to demonstrate good "character and fitness " those standards evolve continuously in the wisconsin supreme court denied lavinia goodell admission because practicing law was "unfit for the female character " in the u s supreme court ruled that state rules must have a rational connection to the ability to practice law overturning new mexicos decision to reject a communist party member in the virginia supreme court said the state couldnt reject an attorney merely because she lived with a man out of wedlock in the illinois supreme court upheld the states rejection of a white supremacist the american bar association in added a provision to its guidelines which many states follow "unlawful conduct" should require "further inquiry " not automatic disqualification factors to consider seriousness of the crime age at the time candor and evidence of rehabilitation mr wiesner blames his troubles on drugs he grew up in staten island and began using marijuana at eventually dropping out of high school inspired by woody guthries autobiography "bound for glory" and jack kerouacs "on the road " he says he left home in at he recalls living a hobo life hanging out in new yorks run down bowery neighborhood he eventually rented a house in staten island and made money giving banjo lessons he says he took community college courses but didnt graduate at age mr wiesner says he and a doctor friend started selling fraudulent prescriptions for quaaludes a sedative to lawyers models and wall streeters he ran the business side of the clinics while various doctors wrote prescriptions the operation grew to include several "clinics" and grossed tens of thousands of dollars a week he says mr wiesner says he enjoyed the high life nightclubbing by limo abusing drugs sipping martinis and hosting all night parties he dated multiple women but eventually settled on cynthia pearce who mr wiesner says answered an ad he placed in the village voice seeking an administrative assistant they lived together for a year or so in mid federal agents raided his clinics and shut them down informed that he faced indictment mr wiesner says he became depressed and intensified his drug habit mr wiesner and ms pearce split up in march he says in july he began making repeated attempts to see her one evening she agreed to meet him at a train station there mr wiesner brandished a walther semiautomatic pistol and forced ms pearce to her apartment according to court records and mr wiesner after seven hours according to court records ms pearce jumped from her second floor window and fractured both heels on impact mr wiesner fired five or six shots in her direction none hit her ms pearce says in an interview she feared for her life after mr wiesner said he planned to kill her two months later the state indicted mr wiesner for attempted murder reckless endangerment burglary unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession and use of a firearm mr wiesner says he sent repeated letters to various judges expressing displeasure with his appointed legal counsel at a november hearing one attorney asked to be taken off the case because mr wiesner insisted on recording their conversations and interrupted her in court mr wiesner knows "precisely what he is doing in regard to this case although he is not a lawyer " the lawyer told justice thomas sullivan court records show justice sullivan replaced the lawyer with another felix gilroy of staten island the following month a federal grand jury indicted mr wiesner on quaalude possession distribution and conspiracy charges when his state trial began on jan he told the judge hed had only one minute telephone conversation with mr gilroy he asked the judge to replace him with the attorney handling his federal drug case which was proceeding simultaneously justice sullivan refused "in that case your honor i dont feel i can go ahead with mr gilroy and i will have to go ahead pro se if you insist " mr wiesner said invoking the latin term used by lawyers to mean that a party is representing himself "you may have great intellectual capabilities " justice sullivan responded "but you do not have the necessary background and training and experience and understanding let alone the objectivity that is necessary for an attorney to do a job properly " after mr gilroy started cross examining the first witness mr wiesner ordered him not to question or call any witnesses or give a closing argument at the trials end mr gilroy asked for a mistrial arguing that mr wiesner should have been allowed to represent himself justice sullivan denied the motion the jury convicted him on all charges except reckless endangerment in federal court mr wiesner began to see a way out of his predicament he says u s district judge gerard goettel of new yorks southern district treated him with respect the two men struck up a correspondence that continues today in mr wiesner sent the judge a book of robert frost poems three years later around christmas he sent a fruit basket and received a handwritten letter in reply "i felt worthless walking into his court like i was an animal" mr wiesner recalls "but he didnt treat me that way he listened to me and made it clear that i had rights " with prison life came sobriety according to a psychiatric evaluation mr wiesner commissioned for his bar applications he says he read almost a book a day and paged through legal journals he worked on his own and other inmates appeals earning the nickname "nealie smarts " he recalls mr wiesner was permitted to represent himself for much of the federal proceedings he questioned witnesses at pretrial hearings he successfully argued to suppress damaging testimony judge goettel quipped in court that the defendant "wasnt pro se he was semi pro se " mr wiesner recalls the judge who is now retired doesnt recall the remark but says it sounds like something he would say after almost two years of legal wrangling federal prosecutors agreed to a plea deal under which mr wiesner was sentenced to the roughly three years he had already served on appeal of the state drug conviction mr wiesner mixed legalese with plain language "the court recognized my waiver of counsel and stopped its imposition but did not conterminously allow my pro se rights to fructify " he wrote in a page brief "i do not see how this court could snake a decision around these facts in order to sustain i hope im right " u s district judge raymond j dearie granted mr wiesners appeal in december the defendant was convicted "without any defense at all a constitutionally impermissible occurrence " he ruled judge dearie ordered mr wiesner retried or released the state appealed lost and opted to let mr wiesner enter a so called alford plea acknowledging that sufficient evidence existed to convict him of some charges without admitting guilt he was released in january by he had earned an undergraduate degree from the state university of new york he completed real estate courses before learning he couldnt get licensed because of his convictions a hospital rejected him for a janitor job he says out of fear he would raid the medicine cabinet he was turned down for a perfume sales position eventually a friend got him a lab job drug testing urine samples but law was his passion "putting pen to paper opened those big metal doors and got me outside the gun towers " he says "if anyone is going to be inflated with the power of the constitution it was me " though warned by judge goettel that his convictions might be a problem mr wiesner entered the city university of new yorks law school students gave nealie smarts a new moniker he says "jailbird " a state judge rejected him for a summer clerkship after learning of his criminal past eventually he landed an internship with new york appellate division justice john carro now retired "he was the best clerk i ever had " recalls justice carro the following summer he did an internship with the brooklyn district attorney who praised his work in a letter later submitted by mr wiesner in mr wiesner received his law degree and applied for admission to the state bar in new york bar applications are reviewed by a character and fitness committee which is made up of volunteer lawyers mr wiesners submission prompted a three day hearing before a three member subcommittee an unusually intensive investigation fifteen witnesses testified for him including justice carro a new york city criminal court judge two prosecutors from the brooklyn district attorneys office and the law school dean of the city university of new york thirteen others submitted supportive affidavits including two new york attorneys who had been accepted despite their criminal records judge goettel told the subcommittee mr wiesner was a changed man he had been "typical of the flower children of the s with a head full of liberal but impractical notions " judge goettel wrote "i believe that the person you are now considering has the necessary qualifications for admission to the bar " mr wiesners testimony probably didnt help he denied trying to kill ms pearce and said he had swallowed enough amphetamines to "kill an elephant " in his version he was suicidal and fired shots only to scare ms pearce fearing she would call the police and thwart his plan to take his own life the subcommittee voted against mr wiesner unmoved by his character witnesses "a majority of these people did not know the nature of the crimes that wiesner had committed " said a report by the majority "their comments generally related to wiesners intellectual acuity and potential legal ability rather than his character " the dissenter was john trubin an attorney who died in his report listed bar approved lawyers with convictions for drugs prostitution and other offenses he praised mr wiesners mentoring of high school students and inmates "it was important to him that once people go to prison they are not thrown in the garbage " wrote mr trubin after reviewing the two reports the full committee voted against admission the final arbiter is the state appellate division in manhattan in a five justice panel rejected his appeal without giving a detailed opinion the following year the same panel denied a new motion when mr wiesner tried again in the secretary of character and fitness committee said in an affidavit it hadnt intended to "permanently" deny mr wiesner "there may be an appropriate time albeit of imprecise definition when renewal of his application might be in order " the affidavit said his motion was denied as was another in fed up he sued the five state justices in federal court in manhattan alleging violations of due process and equal protection a federal judge dismissed the suit saying the issue belonged in state court he filed his fifth state appeal in in response the admission secretary said the denial was "primarily based" on his convictions and "insufficient evidence of remorse and rehabilitation " the motion was denied as were similar ones in and frustrated after a decade of paralegal work mr wiesner in took the new jersey bar exam and passed after hearing many of the same witnesses as new york a new jersey court admitted mr wiesner unanimously new jersey operates under the same rules as new york that cleared mr wiesner to practice in federal court in new jersey a decision he used to gain access to manhattans federal courthouse located next to the state courthouse where he wants to work clients included a drug offender and the owner of an adult bookstore he hired a part time secretary and leased a manhattan office he also renewed his fight against new york filing his second federal suit after the state rejected him for the ninth time in his suit noted that new york had admitted felons with worse criminal records including richard langone who spent years in prison for second degree murder on his th birthday in mr langone shot a year old neighbor in a fight over a girl he earned a law degree in and was rejected twice before being accepted mr langone says patience remorse and a commitment to the law combined to get him admitted to the bar "youre not going to strong arm these judges " he says these days mr wiesner says he works long hours and earns a low six figure income he chain smokes parliaments and drinks wine but says hes drug free his home office is adorned with his law diploma and a poster "ex offenders are people too " in december mr wiesner received a notice saying his ability to practice in new york federal court was "based on administrative error " the new jersey federal court it turns out has no such agreement with its new york counterpart he was ordered to file papers arguing why his admission shouldnt be revoked meanwhile u s district judge harold baer jr ruled on mr wiesners second federal suit on jan "mr wiesner has apparently rehabilitated himself into a contributing member of society and i must add he has done this without much help from our state courts despite the philosophy that applauds rehabilitation " the judge wrote nevertheless he decided such issues are the purview of the state and rejected mr wiesners suit last month mr wiesner formally asked the manhattan federal court not to revoke his admission there his emotion packed pleading quoted author william faulkner "the past isnt dead it isnt even past "
