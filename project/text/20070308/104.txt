the afternoon report great walls of china online edition talk that chinas lawmakers might drop the countrys piping hot stock market into a bucket of cold water was credited with fueling a global selloff last week but other economic reforms may have more lasting reverberations to the abundant relief of chinas burgeoning investor class beijing batted down any talk of taxes on capital gains but a controversial measure introduced in the national peoples congress today that would shield property rights in the communist state could have more far reaching economic consequences than any tax measure efforts to protect private wealth under communism have obvious points of tension vice chairman wang zhaoguo a member of the communist partys powerful politburo said that as chinas economy opens wider "peoples living standards have improved in general and they urgently require effective protection of their own lawful property accumulated through hard work " but the state still preaches economic egalitarianism and enforcing property rights may be difficult officials have often seized homes firms and other potentially lucrative property infuriating owners who get meager or no

china that the breaks should end "it is necessary to unify domestic and foreign funded enterprise income tax as soon as possible " finance minister jin renqing wrote in a report distributed to lawmakers a draft of the bill which would set a uniform tax rate of was passed around to foreign companies and business groups in recent weeks and most indicated they were amenable to the change so

that chinas stunted markets hinder its development and undermine its financial stability "with an underdeveloped financial sector investment in china doesnt reach its potential in generating returns personal saving isnt adequately rewarded and risk is not appropriately priced managed and diversified " mr paulson said "deep and liquid capital markets also increase stability and reduce volatility " shanghai where stocks fell tuesday of last week was described as ground zero in the global market meltdown by some even though beijing allows little foreign investment in its markets making it hard for disruptions to ripple out in any direct fashion but mr paulson noted that of global economic growth over the past five years has come solely from the u s and china "decisions about the pace and shape of your economic reforms as well as policies relating to energy and the environment affect nations around the world " he said stocks stage an early rally gains in europe and asia set the stage
