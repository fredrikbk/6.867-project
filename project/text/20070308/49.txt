picking up over the past decade big european retailers have expanded by opening stores across the faster growing economies in eastern europe asia and latin america adopting strategies that are more global than those of many big u s retailers carrefour has stores in countries but none in the u s american investors have begun circling private equity firms flush with cash and eager to buy big

halley family founded promodes in a carrefour spokesman said mr vandevelde declined to comment a spokesman for the halley family did not return phone calls seeking comment taking retailers like carrefour private can be attractive to private investors for several reasons private equity firms can hire new managers pay them lavishly and direct them to make sweeping changes quickly the kind of moves that can depress quarterly earnings at first but can become profitable later on it can be difficult for public companies to make such moves private equity investors also like retailers large real estate holdings they can sell the real estate and have the retailer rent it back producing an immediate gain such moves can even help to finance the takeovers banks which have been quick to lend in current markets are even more comfortable extending credit when it can be secured by hard assets such as property last year germanys karstadtquelle ag capitalized on huge investor appetite for german retail properties by selling off its real estate holdings to eliminate its debt real estate is at the center of sainsburys appeal to potential buyers current estimates value its real estate

fight with the halley family as an opening into carrefour a person familiar with the matter says it views carrefour as undervalued and somewhat unfocused this person says and it approached mr arnault through its new stake this person says colony might look to push the company to capitalize on the value of the real estate by selling properties and leasing them back to carrefour among other options colony has used such tactics with other investments such as with accor a french hotel group and buffalo grill a steak restaurant chain in france "if colony wants to realize the value of the property thats a positive for me " says daniel white a fund manager with london based new star asset management ltd which holds a stake in carrefour mr white said he welcomed the involvement of colony capital and groupe arnault the private equity interest in european retail could be a precursor to interest in retailers elsewhere many chains in the u s have already been acquired but shares in u s retailers
