a makeover for the cable box new fcc initiative will let devices be interchangeable the set top cable tv box long a drab but necessary electronic appendage may be transformed following a federal communications commission initiative that requires cable companies to deploy boxes with a removable security component starting in july up to now set top boxes have had built in security that controls a customers level of access to cable service new boxes will feature slots for cablecards roughly the size of a credit card that will include all the security technology separating the security component means that set top boxes from various cable companies should be interchangeable instead of getting a new box subscribers could keep the same equipment and switch cable providers by swapping out the cablecard thus a cablevision systems corp subscriber in long island n y could someday take his box to los angeles and sign up for time warner cable using the same box this also means that set top boxes are likely to take on different functions and could crop up in retail stores picture a combination dvd digital video recorder and set top box in one or such a combination with home networking capabilities the set top box may soon go the way of the telephone just as it was once common to lease a phone from the local carrier now its more cost efficient to buy one the fcc initiative is meant to open up the set top box market give consumer electronics makers a chance to better integrate devices and give consumers greater choice "its about consumers not wanting a set top box in their stack " says joshua martin analyst at research firm yankee group hurdles remain however the crux of the problem mr martin says is that consumers dont have much reason to buy fancy units at retailers when they can get one cheap from a cable operator cable companies dont have much incentive to sell boxes in retail stores either true cable companies spend a lot of money on set top boxes and that spending has risen as digital video recorders and high definition become more popular and push up the cost of boxes the initial costs though are eventually recovered companies can lease the boxes to customers for a number of years at &# or &# a month even the cost of a &# box can be recouped in three years or less another challenge to interchangeable cable boxes the home entertainment market is currently a jumble of standards just ask anyone whos been frustrated by efforts to set up a home network and entertainment system to help with this problem the cable industry has come up with the open cable application platform or ocap which works as an operating platform much like microsoft windows cable systems currently use all different standards which makes it difficult to create new applications before set top boxes can be truly interchangeable more cable systems need to adopt ocap the new generation of set top boxes run on ocap but many cable systems havent adopted it yet the headaches are enough to give pause to consumer electronics makers that are thinking of jumping into the market after pushing the fcc for a delay for five years the cable industry is coming to grips with the july deadline and plans are in place to introduce new units that include separable security set top box makers such as motorola inc and scientific atlanta now part of cisco systems inc unveiled their new lineups at the consumer electronics show in january while pace micro technology plc announced its lineup monday although cable set top box makers dont have any plans to start selling boxes in stores the idea is under consideration that means bye bye clunky design motorola "redesigned the boxes so they look more like motorola designed products " a company spokesman says pace says it didnt need to redesign its lineup because some of its cable boxes are already sold in canadian stores tv set makers meanwhile have observed the move to separate security in recent years many manufacturers have come out with flat screen tvs that include a slot for cable cards with a cable card enabled tv minimalists can hang their tvs on the wall and dont have to find a place to stash the cable box the problem with the first generation of products has been that the tvs couldnt access video on demand or other functions that require two way tv with just a cable card the new generation of cards and products has overcome that limitation but tv makers so far arent all that excited about the market since most consumers dont consider cable cards an important issue when buying a television set
