politics &amp economics labor works on election clout edwards leads in endorsements for now as afl cio lays out plan las vegas john edwards appears to be organized labors favorite presidential candidate right now but as unions try to maximize clout and pick a winner they could very well change their minds the afl cio officially kicked off its endorsement process yesterday at its winter executive council meeting here laying out a multi step plan for vetting candidates in the coming months a major goal is to strengthen labors support behind a single candidate to avoid having the federations affiliate unions endorse multiple candidates as they have in the past which has diluted organized labors impact unions remain a potent force inside the democratic party but they have struggled with how to wield their power in some elections labor has united to use its clout to help a clear front runner early in the campaign process as it did for al gore in in other cases labor has split its early support leading to embarrassing setbacks that happened in when the major unions divided between richard gephardt and howard dean in the primaries and neither one prevailed exposing the unions as weak even inside the democratic party to stop unions within the federation from jumping out with early endorsements especially given this elections accelerated pace the afl cio passed a resolution encouraging unions not to endorse a candidate until the leaders of all affiliate unions decide together whether to endorse a candidate prior to the primaries and if so which candidate to endorse that decision could be made in september at the earliest meanwhile the candidates are eagerly courting labor campaign managers or senior advisers of all of the democratic candidates made pitches to presidents of the afl cios unions at a reception this week although unions have declined to publicly state a preference for any candidate at this early stage union leaders invariably mention mr edwardss name first and they are quick to praise his open support of labor "im very impressed with john edwards because hes a candidate that comfortably uses the word union " said harold schaitberger president of the international association of fire fighters "heres somebody who said the union movement is something this country should be proud of that it is critical to rebuilding the middle class " many in the labor movement view mr edwards as one of their own his father worked in a mill and his brother is a member of the international brotherhood of electrical workers in the election mr edwards received only one major labor endorsement for the presidential nomination instead becoming the democratic nominee for vice president since then labor experts say mr edwards has deliberately tried to become the union candidate mr edwardss selection of david bonior a former michigan congressman with strong ties to the afl cio as his campaign manager is widely seen as an effort to further shore up labors support in the past two years mr edwards has participated in labor actions joining demonstrations and organizing drives including visiting hotel workers and trying to make beds and clean rooms under conditions faced by workers as well as calling ceos on behalf of unions according to mr bonior leo gerard president of the united steelworkers said mr edwards contacted the union to lend support during the recent strike against goodyear tire &amp rubber co and joined picket lines with workers "that made a big impact on our members " said mr gerard in december the afl cio made its strongest statement of support so far for mr edwards by giving him its paul wellstone award for supporters of labor rights to be sure democratic front runners hillary clinton and barack obama have also reached out to labor and could win an eventual labor endorsement especially if mr edwards looks like he doesnt have a realistic chance for election and unions back away from him lately mr obama has been a strong supporter of the american federation of state county and municipal employees campaign to organize roughly nurses and other workers at a hospital system in chicago he has also expressed strong support for the employee free choice act labors top legislative priority which would make it easier to organize workers among other measures in november mr obama participated on a conference call with wakeupwalmart com a group funded by the united food and commercial workers to encourage activist critics of wal mart stores inc in his senate campaign mr obama had support from the service employees international union and afscme while many other unions backed his opponent many in the labor movement view mr obama as an exciting figure but are unsure about his track record "at this point our people are saying hes got charisma lets see what hell say on real issues " says mr gerard for her part mrs clinton faces an uphill battle with some unions because many associate her with the more centrist policies of her husband in particular the passage during the clinton presidency of the north american free trade agreement which they believe struck a direct blow to unionized workers and led to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the u s "organized labor was not really happy with bill clinton " says robert bruno a professor of labor and industrial relations at the university of illinois chicago "there is not a real passion within the rank and file for hillary " however gerald mcentee president of afscme said the union doesnt necessarily equate mrs clinton with nafta calling it "her husbands program " he added "it cant be an endorsement of support based on a single litmus test no matter what that may be "
