home &amp family clock change may jumble flight connections with the arrival of daylight saving time on sunday three weeks ahead of last years schedule the afternoon skies will stay brighter longer but for some travelers this could lead to hassles thanks to an impending disconnect between european and u s clocks cross continental fliers whose trips entail connections within or beyond the u s may find it harder to get a convenient connection and may need to schedule long layovers say airline representatives the change is one of many expected to affect consumers due to the early time change thanks to both the technicalities of the switch as well as the consumer behavior likely to follow from it already some consumers are gearing up to avoid time related troubles on electronic devices and may have to scramble to update their software programs internal clocks with the airlines the glitch arises because as clocks in the u s except arizona "spring forward" this weekend that wont happen in europe for two more weeks during that period flights that would normally land at a convenient time for a connection will be off schedule next year and in the gap between europe and u s clocks will last for three weeks some travelers could end up waiting hours for the next flight to their destinations extended layover times airlines generally try not to exceed two hours will be most pronounced for international itineraries that begin or end at u s regional airports amr corp s american airliness daily flight from madrid to miami for example currently makes its scheduled landing in miami at p m local time typically passengers have about minutes to catch a connection to houston at p m travelers going on to bogota colombia usually have a little more than two hours to catch their p m connection but next week travelers on americans madrid miami route will be scheduled to land at p m local time says airline spokesman tim wagner which means theyll likely be unable to make the p m connection and instead will have to wait over five hours for the next plane to houston those traveling on to bogota might not make the p m connection instead they might need to schedule a flight for a m the next morning so why cant u s airlines simply move up the departure time of their flights originating in europe ensuring that passengers can get better connections doing that is difficult because of strict "use it or lose it" rules regarding time slots at european airports u s airlines have little flexibility to adjust their schedules because if they did they could risk losing control over a valuable time slot at busy hubs according to the air transport association a trade organization for u s airlines at europes busiest destinations such as paris charles de gaulle international airport frankfurt international airport and londons heathrow airport prime runway slots are precious business assets says john hansman a professor of aeronautics and the head of mits international center for air transportation the same issue applies to asia according to steve lott a spokesman for the international air transport association a global industry group asias hub airports that use slot controlled runways include those in tokyo hong kong singapore and sydney some travelers may be able to avoid the timing woes by making their connections at european hub airports instead so the traveler looking to get from madrid to houston for example could connect to a direct flight at another european airport instead of miami in an issue brief released last month the air transport association argued that some travelers would be driven to foreign airlines "it makes it less attractive to connect in the u s than to connect in europe so there may be an advantage to european carriers " mr hansman says just how inconvenienced fliers on u s airlines will find themselves remains to be seen mr wagner the spokesman for american airlines called the issue "a very significant problem " but mary clark a spokeswoman for continental airlines inc said "some international itineraries may be affected slightly but we think weve done our best to minimize any disruption to our customers " mits mr hansman also predicts that the out of sync airline schedules wont cause too many headaches "any change creates some sort of disturbance in the system " he adds "how significant is this compared with a snowstorm at jfk i would say this is not as big of a deal "
