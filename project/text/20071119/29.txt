growing concern tainted gingers long trip from china to u s stores supply chains make finding source tough lots of small farms juxian china in july two dozen albertsons grocery stores in california received a shipment of fresh ginger and put it on shelves several days later state inspectors discovered that the ginger which had been imported from china contained a dangerous pesticide state health officials warned californians to avoid ginger grown in china but while the tainted gingers country of origin was clear the actual supplier let alone the farm where it grew was anything but the path of this batch of ginger some miles around the world shows how global supply chains have grown so long that some u s companies cant be sure where the products theyre buying are made or grown and without knowing the source of the product its difficult to solve the problem layers of middlemen obscure who actually produces goods complicating efforts to police the production process in the case of the tainted pet food that first raised concern over chinese imports in march neither the chinese government nor the u s food and drug administration has pinpointed the original source of the problem ingredient contaminated wheat gluten in that probe fda officials traveled to china and worked with the chinese government but often u s officials trace problems with food imports only within american borders due partly to limited resources industry analysts say many u s companies save money by sourcing in china but are reluctant to spend on vetting supply chains "you cant just throw the orders over the great wall and hope it comes back good " says kent d kedl general manager for technomic asia a consulting firm in shanghai that advises u s and european clients he says companies "need people camped out" in china some u s companies dedicate hundreds of people to keeping track of chinese shipments but others dedicate little to the effort christopher ranch llc in gilroy calif is one of the companies that bought the chinese ginger and distributed it to supermarkets bill christopher owner says his company didnt test products it purchased because it expected the chinese exporter to follow u s rules since the recall he says he is now doing testing on imported products mr christopher says the u s government should assume more responsibility "the government needs to do more testing and if they dont have enough people then they shouldnt allow so much food into this country " he says "i dont think it can be the responsibility of every supermarket and every broker " american companies that buy chinese grown produce often demand such low prices that it isnt practical for exporters and importers to run tests says clara shih president of best buy produce international inc the vernon calif company imports chinese grown produce and resells it to other buyers including supermarkets "people in this country dont really care as long as its cheap " says ms shih chinese ginger which shows up in american cuisine in everything from soups to stir fry to cookies and tea is cheap prior to the recall christopher ranch was buying ginger from china for about &# per pound box after the

unground dry ginger imported into the u s says the u s department of agriculture in july inspectors for the california department of pesticide regulation tested samples of fresh ginger at a save mart supermarkets inc distribution center and found potentially harmful levels of aldicarb sulfoxide a pesticide not approved for use on ginger by the u s environmental protection agency aldicarb is registered for restricted use on certain u s crops including cotton peanuts and soybeans the epa says that applying limited levels of the pesticide to certain crops often early in the growing process doesnt pose a risk to health china has similar restrictions in addition to ginger china has banned the pesticide on certain vegetables fruit trees tea leaves and chinese herbal medicine says the ministry of agriculture in beijing aldicarb is considered a health threat under certain conditions symptoms of aldicarb poisoning including nausea headaches and blurred vision can occur within an hour of exposure according to the california department of public health higher levels can cause muscle spasms and difficulty breathing at high doses aldicarb can be fatal on july california officials announced the recall after discovering the problem during an ongoing state program to monitor pesticide use the recall included ginger sold at albertsons supermarkets in northern california owned by save mart supermarkets modesto calif the state warned consumers who had purchased the ginger to discard it and contact their physician if they had symptoms of poisoning it warned consumers to avoid fresh ginger from china two shoppers at stores owned by save mart reported temporarily experiencing some symptoms says a spokeswoman for the chain she says the company expects its suppliers to ensure their foods are safe and like many grocers requires suppliers to sign forms stating products are hazard free the california health department hasnt received any reports of illnesses spokeswoman lea brooks says the recall triggered concern across the food industry pittsburgh ketchup giant h j heinz co which uses ginger in some soups and frozen meals contacted suppliers to ensure no product was contaminated says a spokesman glenn farrell president of full flavor food products inc a california firm that makes a ginger puree used by heinz says he had his ginger independently tested for all pesticides with no problems although not directly involved in the recall other grocery companies reacted trader joes a monrovia calif grocery chain with some stores in more than states decided to indefinitely discontinue sales of all individual food products from china by years end a spokeswoman says safeway inc the nations fourth largest food retailer by sales has stopped selling chinese grown ginger and garlic "for the foreseeable future " a spokeswoman says both say the recall was one of several reasons for their decision not long after the tainted ginger was discovered california authorities and the fda began to try to trace the gingers source they learned save mart had purchased the ginger from christopher ranch one of the nations largest garlic growers christopher ranch bought about pounds of ginger from another california company modern trading inc mr christopher says on july david margosian an investigator from the los angeles county department of health services visited modern trading which was operating in a southern california warehouse next to a mattress supply company according to county records mr margosian discovered the company lacked a public health license required by county law for companies handling food the county ordered modern trading to halt operations that day rich pirozzoli national logistics manager for christopher ranch who had visited modern trading says he wasnt aware it had no health license "there are so many companies down there that sell the chinese ginger " he says "you kind of go from one to the other based on whats available " five other distributors purchased parts of the tainted ginger load from modern trading says ms brooks of the california health department the fda investigated modern trading but didnt probe the source of the ginger in china the agency tested a sample of ginger at modern trading and found no illegal pesticides says fda spokesman michael herndon the fda has occasionally conducted inspections of food producers outside the u s after injuries or outbreaks but "it is more common and more efficient to" restrict imports at the border says fda spokesman brad swezey that could change under a recent proposal by the bush administration to better police imports the plan includes among other things putting more u s inspectors overseas according to records filed with the california secretary of state modern trading was incorporated by liu zhian in may copies of shipping documents provided by mr christopher show modern trading imported the ginger from a company in china juxian modern organic ginger co in shandong province the documents certified by chinese government officials list an invoice date of june and show that the shipment totaled about pounds in a faxed statement a person calling himself liu zhian corporate representative of modern organic which is also known by its chinese name hua teng organic ginger co said it isnt clear that modern organic was the source of the tainted shipment modern trading the california company bought ginger from several companies in los angeles as well as from modern organic in juxian china he said in his statement "obviously it is a fact that they found problematic ginger from china but no evidence shows which exact providers this ginger was from " he said in china modern organic buys ginger from thousands of farmers packages it then ships it around the world says liu zhixue a year old manager at the company and brother of liu zhian modern organic is one of scores of ginger exporters in china a farmer may sell only a few thousand pounds of ginger to the company liu zhixue says so a standard foot long shipping container might be filled with produce from or more farmers in an interview at modern organics office in juxian an agriculture hub where trucks loaded with apples and onions race down roads mr liu said the chinese government recently shuttered his ginger export operation one recent day the companys warehouse was dark with hundreds of boxes of ginger in limbo mr liu said he didnt understand the fuss "chinese people have always eaten this ginger no problem " the chinese government has recently restricted ginger exports from other companies in the area u s distributors importers and chinese farmers say the government is now requiring shipments to be inspected before being exported weeding out smaller unapproved companies says jim provost president of i love produce llc a pennsylvania importer of garlic and ginger who recently was in shandong to meet with suppliers the ministry of agriculture said in a written statement "it is illegal to use aldicarb in ginger farms and those who violate the regulation will be seriously punished " the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine chinas quality control agency didnt reply to written questions about modern organic and the ginger shipment but in an interview earlier this year on a range of topics including agricultural exports li changjiang head of the person inspection service welcomed u s officials to do on site checks of chinese farms "if there are chinese exported products which dont meet the u s standards then we could make corrections " mr li said at his headquarters in beijing its not clear how the chinese ginger became contaminated with aldicarb "we dont have an exact answer for that at this moment " liu zhian said in his statement the house committee on energy and commerce recently sent investigators to china to learn more about its food production system in the wake of tainted product scandals the committee issued a report last month that said the processing industry is "largely composed of very small family based operations " making it difficult for the government "to monitor food production activities in order to ensure product safety " liu zhian said his company examines ginger from the farmers it buys from and sometimes tests for more than chemicals "we will take samples from the ginger and send it to the commodity inspection bureau the tests are carried out very frequently " he said in the statement liu weizhong a ginger farmer in juxian says he is one of modern organics suppliers from a half acre of land he has been selling ginger most recently for cents a pound mr liu uses only pesticides allowed by the government "to kill the germs " he says pointing to spiky three foot high ginger plants he was referring to a product he and others in the area use to battle fungus "we just use it on the leaves of the ginger to protect the plants " mr liu says he doesnt use aldicarb which is used to kill insects and knows of no farmers who do at the juxian agricultural materials shop no which sells to local farmers a notice from the juxian ministry of agriculture was glued to a wall detailing five banned pesticides aldicarb though only allowed on certain crops wasnt listed "we still find that in some towns and villages there are people defying the prohibition and selling pesticides containing these five poisons which seriously affect the quantity of agricultural products in our country and threaten directly peoples health " says the march notice shop owner yang mingzhi says government officials occasionally come to his shop to make sure hes not selling banned products "this year they are coming much more often than in years past " says mr yang a few doors down at huayang pesticide co farmers can buy a package of pesticide containing aldicarb directions on the label suggest using grams for about a tenth of an acre to kill red spiders the one kilogram package whose brand name "shen dong dan " translates as "gold farmer pill" sells for &# and is popular with farmers said the shopkeeper who declined to give his name the pesticide carries a warning in red letters "strict prohibition against use on vegetables melon and fruit " as well as a warning not to use the chemical in paddy fields
