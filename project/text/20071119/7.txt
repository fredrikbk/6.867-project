ahead of the tape crunch worries may yet go way of yk amid all of the recent debt market turmoil it is important to remember that when people see smoke coming out of a house somebody usually calls the fire department friday a note from goldman sachs economist jan hatzius made a splash on wall street mr hatzius kicked it off with a back of the envelope estimate that credit losses on mortgages might reach &# billion based on the large amount of subprime and alt a mortgages that have been originated since and an expectation that house prices as measured by the s&amp p shiller case index will fall peak to trough big as a &# billion loss would be on the face of it this doesnt seem steep enough to put the economy at serious risk for comparisons sake this month when the dow jones industrial average had a one day drop of the total value of the u s stock market fell by an estimated &# billion but unlike stocks which are mostly held by mutual funds and other plain vanilla investors more than half of all mortgages are held by banks brokers and other financial firms banks need to hold a reservoir of shareholder equity against their loans as a cushion for tough times if they take big losses that reservoir gets depleted to keep it in balance with their loans they will cut back on the amount of credit they extend sometimes drastically indeed the federal reserves latest quarterly loan officer survey showed that banks were tightening lending standards on loans of all stripes brokers behave similarly though their models would call for an even more drastic reduction in risk in response to a loss mr hatzius says using what he calls conservative assumptions he comes to an estimated &# trillion reduction in the supply of credit if it happens over the space of one year it could lead to a "substantial recession " mr hatzius says the report made the rounds in in boxes all over wall street on friday before you stock up on canned goods remember the so called yk problem the computer glitch that it was feared would send a spasm through computers around the world at the beginning of grinding the global financial system to a halt when the new millennium came there was nary a problem because people spent a lot of time ensuring there wouldnt be as mr hatzius points out rather than cutting back on lending financial firms could instead raise capital by selling stock or selling stakes to other firms with sounder balance sheets banks will continue to earn a profit on all the loans they have made that arent going sour and over time that will replenish their losses many were better capitalized going into this crunch than were in the past and finally the federal reserve is going to try to limit the damage "in an environment where you have more downside risks to the economy you get a policy response " mr hatzius says send comments to justin lahart wsj com
