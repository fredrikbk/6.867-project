desperados one of the most popular rock bands of all time has finally managed to offend not for its songs but for how it sells them theres a lesson here in technology new business models and hidebound "progressives " the first new album from the eagles in over a decade "long road out of eden " has already sold more than a million copies hitting billboards # in its first week its the kind of blockbuster that used to pay christmas bonuses at the big record companies only this album wasnt produced by a big record company the eagles released it themselves and are selling it exclusively through wal mart this isnt going down well in certain elite precincts music blogs accused the group of selling out while a review in rolling stone opined that there is an "inevitable contradiction in buying a record that attacks corporate greed from a superchain with a bleak record on employee rights and health care " a piece in the boston herald noted that "the deal will make the eagles richer but it could cost them cool points if the aging rockers have any left " so how can don henley an environmentalist who wrote a song mocking ronald reagan embrace a middle american retail colossus out of favor with enlightened opinion how can the # album not be available in new york city where politicians have blocked wal mart from opening even a single store "you would have thought we did a deal with the devil " mr henley says "people have been crying out for a new paradigm so we did something new " that something turns out to be good business in cutting out the record company the band cut itself in for a bigger share of the per album profits while it might have expected fewer sales from restricted availability that doesnt seem to be happening wal marts retail price of under &# for the two disc album has allowed smaller retailers to stock up on the album at wal mart and then resell them with a markup the eagles arent the first to try new ways to sell a record garth brooks signed an exclusive deal in with wal mart and has sold millions of records beyonce has released an exclusive dvd through the store joni mitchell and paul mccartney are selling their music through starbucks billy joels daughter alexa ray is trying to establish her own music career by doing an exclusive with target these and others are evidence that napster and its filesharing successors werent the death of the music business but a smart bomb that forced the creation of new delivery models apples itunes is the most famous but the web has allowed thousands of bands to find new audiences and even create global niche brands thanks to the internet a norwegian metal band named enslaved has been able to fill small town bars and auditoriums in the u s alas some rockers sound like old fogies complaining that nothing is as good as it used to be kisss gene simmons says he cant be bothered to go into the studio anymore because the business model that made him rich no longer works as he told reuters recently he blames filesharing "every little college kid every freshly scrubbed little kids face should have been sued off the face of the earth they should have taken their houses and cars and nipped it right there " we believe in property rights as much as anyone but when technology is changing businesses have to change too and that includes the business of music so lets applaud mr henley glenn frey joe walsh and the other eagles for some creative capitalism however politically incorrect see related letter "letters to the editor the eagles pricing rocks " wsj nov
