in stocks new global seas the economic boom in emerging markets is changing many of the rules of thumb investors have used to guide their decisions complicating an already tricky environment it used to be that stocks in emerging markets were cheaper than u s stocks and vulnerable to a u s slowdown that bonds in those places offered much juicier yields and that a weak u s economy put downward pressure on prices for commodities like oil many of these rules are now being ditched by investors because places like china india and russia are growing rapidly despite troubles in the u s the emerging markets it seems have emerged and are forcing investors to rethink their worldview in one reversal of a longstanding trend shares of emerging markets have begun trading at a premium to those in developed markets at the end of october the stocks that make up the msci emerging markets index were trading at times their earnings for the previous months in comparison the stocks in an msci index that tracks developed markets around the world were trading at times earnings three years ago the stocks in the emerging markets index traded at roughly times their prior years earnings while developed market counterparts traded at nearly times earnings "the whole set of rules that starts with the u s as the prime mover of all things economic is clearly under duress right now " says ing investment management economic adviser james griffin the international monetary fund estimates that while u s gross domestic product will have grown this year down from last year growth in the rest of the world will be on par with last year with other advanced economies growing and emerging market and developing economies growing the risk is that as investors throw out old assumptions about what drives the world economy and markets they will overreach in formulating new ones that is what happened during the dot com bubble of the late s when notions of how technology would change the world ran away from reality analysts already worry about a bubble in chinese stocks typically stocks in asia have traded at a to discount to shares world wide says robert buckland chief global equity strategist at citigroup but he says "if you run a strategy which always sells asia when it hits a discount youd have sold it way too early " mr buckland says he recently spoke to an investment manager who was betting that cheap european financial stocks would rise while relatively expensive asian bank shares would fall the problem was that the former were only getting cheaper and the latter more expensive "if he had put that trade on four years ago " it might have worked says mr buckland those types of trades are going to struggle during the next few years he predicts as markets go from "value obsessed to thinking about growth " investors also are re evaluating how emerging markets respond during times of stress anthony cragg who manages a portfolio of asian stocks at wells capital management says that for most of his nearly three decades in the business there "was almost a pavlovian response if the u s does badly sell asia " that hasnt quite happened yet in recent weeks markets in asia have actually held up better than the u s the dow jones industrial average has fallen since its recent high oct but an msci index tracking asian emerging markets is down in the same period measured in dollars mr cragg is worried the flood of money flowing into these markets is going into stocks indiscriminately long term investors dont like to see "a buying panic like the macys spring sale " he says "you need to see these markets as real places not casinos " his strategy has been to focus on companies that provide the framework for chinese economic growth such as commodities power plants or ports rather than what he considers more chancy bets like retailers a similar process is unfolding in the realm of emerging market bonds there the improving economic fundamentals in many developing countries have produced a slow change in how investors treat this kind of debt particularly the bonds issued by governments as of friday it cost less to buy five year credit protection on sovereign bonds issued by brazil than it does on bonds issued by lehman brothers or merrill lynch says michael gomez co head of emerging markets at bond giant pacific investment management co "we look up and we shake our heads were still adjusting to the new reality " he says mr gomez sees opportunity in debt issued by countries in their local currencies instruments that in many cases didnt exist until recently brazil for instance issued a year bond denominated in brazilian reais in the local market for the first time earlier this year part of a process to give investors access to longer maturities in these assets pimco now holds some of this debt which yields about whats happened to oil prices also has challenged the old rule books crack spreads or the difference between oil prices and the u s price of gasoline and other refined petroleum products have been relatively narrow this fall which suggested a drop in crude prices was in the offing rising u s oil inventories and slowing u s demand also pointed to falling crude prices "anyone who has been looking at u s crack spreads only u s inventory only u s demand only is only getting part of the story " says howard simons a strategist at bianco research the larger story is that china india and much of the rest of the developing world have reached a point where their demand plays a crucial role in setting the price for oil yet investors run the risk of taking these trades too far for instance the dollars weakness coupled with a slower u s economy is putting pressure on exports from the nation euro area japans economy has been sluggish lately and energy prices if they stay high could put it at serious risk "if japan goes into a recession and the euro zone cools off and the u s goes into a recession i have a feeling china and the other asian tigers will feel it " says northern trust economist paul kasriel "maybe its too soon to say that were in a new era "
