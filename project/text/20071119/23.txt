foreign health affairs america a nation prone to love at first sight with seductive health care fixes is now falling for the systems of the netherlands and switzerland their representatives recently displayed their dowry in d c and u s health and human services secretary michael leavitt personally checked out the potential brides earlier this month beware the last time we fell in love it was with managed care as exemplified by californias kaiser permanente but the kaiser model proved difficult to replicate outside of california even for kaiser itself the version of managed care we got was of the "just say no" variety "no" to enrollee requests and provider referrals it has made a mess of our health care system though media accounts lump the systems of switzerland and the netherlands together they are profoundly different there are things to be learned from each though neither presents a complete model the u s should emulate the swiss and dutch systems share one terrific feature universal coverage americans increasingly want this both achieve universal coverage using private sector insurers at far lower cost than the u s of gdp for switzerland and for the dutch versus a staggering for the u s in they also have far better health outcomes than the u s even when switzerland is compared to socio demographically similar u s states such as connecticut and massachusetts the sick in both countries can afford to buy health insurance and also pay the same price yet private insurers compete in the market because they are paid more for sick enrollees through various risk adjustment systems but the devil is in the details the swiss are required to buy health insurance themselves using their own money they account for of health care expenditures if individuals cannot afford it most cantons transfer funds to them there are neither employer nor government health insurance programs for the poor or elderly the swiss government accounts for only a quarter of the health care spending versus nearly for the u s the swiss system is consumer driven because consumers themselves pay for their purchases the dutch government in contrast funds consumers to purchase their own health insurance to a much greater extent five million people in the country are on some sort of government dole thus when the dutch buy their insurance they may think they are using other peoples money the results the swiss have lower health care inflation versus for the dutch and the u s from and substantially more in the way of health care resources and switzerland tops the world in most measures of user satisfaction the private insurance companies that compete in switzerland dwarf the in the netherlands swiss providers also compete because in addition to paying for their health insurance the swiss pay for nearly of their health care services out of their own pockets as compared with only for the dutch yet even with its limitations dutch health care inflation fell from the time when dutch employers bought health care and waiting lists have reportedly tumbled nevertheless the swiss system is hardly perfect on the demand side the government limits insurance competition with requirements for extensive minimum benefit packages and considerable micromanagement of prices imagine a car market in which the government designs the vehicles and stringently oversees distributors prices pretty soon all the cars would come with features we do not necessarily want heated seats at a price we do not want to pay even worse is the swiss governments micromanagement of medical care suppliers unwisely adopting the u s governments medicare payment system it not only dictates medical care prices but also specifies the bundles of care for which it will pay this kind of micromanagement discourages innovation for example when duke medical center lowered the costs of treating congestive heart patients by in only one year with innovations that improved health status it lost nearly all the savings it created the u s government pays only for activities like hospital stays and doctor visits perversely medical innovators who improve health and reduce hospital visits lose money so before we latch on to the dutch or swiss models lets be careful yes the consumer driven health care of these two nations is clearly the better model for implementing universal coverage but their governments micromanagement of the prices of insurers and providers should be avoided not emulated instead government should help lower income people enforce transparency prosecute fraud and abuse but otherwise get out of the way ms herzlinger is professor of business administration at harvard business school and a senior fellow at the manhattan institute she is the author of "who killed health care " new york mcgraw hill
