setting new carbon standards sellers and buyers of offsets aim to stem abusers an industry selling environmental "passes" that let anyone from corporations to carpoolers claim they are helping to reduce global warming has established a set of standards to answer skeptics who say the system is rife with abuse the move underscores the difficulty of curbing the emissions that contribute to global warming at a time when concern is rising fast saturday the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change a group of scientists issued a report warning of serious consequences from greenhouse gas emissions and calling for intensified global action to curb them the report is likely to guide debate at a bigger u n global warming conference set for next month in bali indonesia hanging over calls for tougher action are two big questions how much will it cost to clean up the atmosphere and who will pay that is at the heart of the debate over the environmental passes known as "carbon offsets " the controversy has prompted sellers of the offsets to devise a self policing standard they hope will legitimize their commodities the u n panel said this year that greenhouse gas emissions from human activity particularly the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal are "very likely" the main cause of global warming but curbing those emissions is hard carbon offsets present an easier way for companies and consumers to lighten their impact on the atmosphere or at least to appear to be trying the offsets represent cuts in global warming emissions that have been made somewhere in the world the idea is that money raised from the offsets funds projects to reduce emissions projects are popping up from texas to china and range from planting trees which suck up carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas to capturing methane another greenhouse gas that is emitted by rotting animal waste on farms but the rapid growth of offsets and their lack of regulation is raising doubts about whether the emission cuts the sellers are claiming really are taking place today three groups representing some of the biggest sellers and buyers of carbon offsets are set to announce a "voluntary carbon standard" intended to distinguish offsets that are real from those that arent "were trying to give the basic assurance that theyre getting what theyre paying for " said mark kenber policy director at the climate group a london nonprofit organization that helped develop the standards the stakes are high particularly in the u s where the voluntary carbon market is concentrated companies using offsets to meet pledges they have made to go green are worried about the public relations fallout if the offsets turn out to be bogus and questions about the markets legitimacy are figuring prominently in an intensifying debate in congress over whether the u s should slap industry with mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions these voluntary offsets differ from the pollution permits traded under the kyoto protocol the international global warming treaty national governments and companies that committed to curb their emissions under kyoto are buying and selling official licenses to pollute the u s rejected kyoto the voluntary offset market has emerged as a way for companies or individuals not bound by the kyoto agreement to still show they are addressing global warming judging by the number of offsets sold and their prices the value of the voluntary offset market shot up to &# million in estimated a recent report from research firms ecosystem marketplace and new energy finance it projected further robust growth web sites are popping up to sell offsets to airline travelers who want to counteract the emissions produced by their trip for instance each offset is supposed to represent one ton of carbon dioxide avoided a report earlier this year from the tufts climate initiative an organization affiliated with tufts university found that travelers were paying &# to &# per carbon offset the goal of the new standard is to give consumers confidence that they are buying a legitimate and a consistent product "would you buy something whose quality youre not familiar with " said andrei marcu executive director of the international emissions trading association which represents many of the markets players and helped design the new voluntary standard the new standard seeks to apply some uniformity to the voluntary market but not as much as in the regulated market under the kyoto agreement the multibillion dollar kyoto based pollution credit market is overseen by u n sanctioned officials who must approve projects before credits are sold companies selling voluntary carbon offsets arent required to adhere to the standard though its developers think public pressure will push many to do so there also is no independent panel to approve or reject projects contributing to criticism that the new standard isnt tough enough one big issue is trees which counteract global warming because they consume carbon dioxide as they grow but emit it when they are burned forestry projects account for a big chunk of the voluntary offset market under the new voluntary standards offset sellers must have their forest projects vetted by companies trained to verify that the projects are accomplishing as much as they claim but anja kollmuss the author of the tufts climate initiative study says the lack of an independent panel to approve or reject voluntary offset projects raises concerns about a conflict of interest between companies developing the projects and the companies they hire for verification
