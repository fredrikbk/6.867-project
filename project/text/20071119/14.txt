considering which is the greater threat roger bate "last chance for ddt " op ed nov criticizes our article among others "that report bad news about ddt " to avoid misunderstanding we would like to clarify our articles two purposes the first was to show that the recommendation of the world health organization who to use ddt for indoor residual spray against malaria mosquitoes has not changed despite an apparent who policy change in september who announced "new" recommendations for malaria control here ddt for indoor use is part of the strategy however who has continuously supported ddt use ever since its less than successful malaria eradication campaign during the s and s the campaign was largely based on ddt spraying and was terminated in due to insecticide resistance developed by malaria mosquitoes resistance to insecticides is based on genetic changes or mutations that will eventually develop in insects exposed to insecticides this is simply an evolutionary strategy to ensure survival mutations happen and those insects that mutate are more likely to survive the second purpose of our article was to emphasize that a single silver bullet solution such as ddt to control malaria is not realistic as mr bate himself states ddt is not a panacea instead several types of interventions are needed in an integrated approach to vector management despite the good track record of ddt in controlling malaria we need to find alternative control options because evolutionary forces predispose ddt resistance in addition the persistence of ddt in the environment affects non target organisms as well as food and water supplies the implications of ddt on human health may be debated but should not be underestimated a recent study reported in medscape today showed that high levels of serum ddt predicted a statistically significant five fold increased risk of breast cancer among women who were born after ddt is dangerous and should be treated as such to relieve the burden of malaria we need an arsenal of interventions suitable to local variations in climate environment human behavior and practices where malaria control is particularly difficult ddt will remain an option but its use must be carefully controlled by regulatory authorities reducing the chemical burden on ourselves and our environment is our responsibility to future generations hans overgaard ph d project coordinator bioforsk plantehelse hogskolevn norway reading mr bates article on the failure to widely use ddt really upset me think about the lives that could be saved and are being lost due to the actions of the united nations and other so called friends of the poor and downtrodden folks from africa and other third world countries i happen to be a survivor of ddt i grew up on a farm in the s s and s we had about milk cows several pig sows and many young piglets horses and many free range chickens we also had an outhouse we had house flies horse flies mosquitoes and many other bugs when ddt became available it was amazing how great it was we sprayed with a small hand sprayer we sprayed the cows in the milk barn the pig pens the horse barn and the out house we sprayed the window screen at the house and porch but not in the house the results were fantastic the flies and mosquitoes disappeared you could have a lunch out on the front lawn without being swarmed with flies we as well as every one else drank the milk from cows that were sprayed with ddt i am years old and have suffered no ill effects from ddt my three sisters and brother have not had any illnesses related to ddt my schoolmates neighbors and friends were all exposed to ddt and all have lived normal lives ddt was used throughout the u s if it had been harmful it would have easily identified it wasnt don makinson sherman texas
