black golds yellow link oil hints metal may rise london sizzling crude oil prices have outpaced even golds heady rise this year throwing the historical interrelationship between the two commodities out of kilter but not completely off track crude oil and gold still share several key parallels that make the oil gold ratio a useful barometer analysts say for the six decades until this one one ounce of gold bought roughly barrels of crude oil yet the gold oil ratio is now about to on this basis gold looks cheap it is as unlikely to double in price as oil is to plummet but gold and oil respond to the same signals which are positive for the price of both commodities "sharp moves in oil suggest tension in the system and add to inflationary pressures and gold responds " says thebulliondesks ross norman the nearby november contract for gold on the comex division of the new york mercantile exchange settled friday at &# a troy ounce down for the week while nymex december crude was at &# a barrel down for the week to be sure gold has long been used as a hedge against inflation it is deemed to be a store of value when the value of paper money falls while some analysts question whether these attributes are justified few can deny that gold and oil have benefited from the current inflationary environment the situation was the same in the s when the oil price spike led to a surge in gold because of inflation central banks then acted to get inflation under control while better alternatives to manage inflation such as inflation linked bonds were developed yet ever expanding u s debt and a backdrop of worries in the global credit markets mean something has changed analysts say the federal reserve is unlikely to fight inflation by raising interest rates to the extent that it could trigger a recession as happened in the s "now again inflation is a major worry but against a very sensitive financial backbone " says stephen flood of gold investments "gold is reflective of the pressures that high oil prices bring to the economy " if u s growth slows to the extent that it spills over into asia and the rest of the world gold is set to "massively outperform " says michael lewis global head of commodities research at deutsche bank "a dollar overshoot to the downside is great for gold it happens when the economic environment is weak and equities collapse " he says "this would create global financial market instability including exchange rate gyrations declining growth and create a weakening oil demand story which isnt an unrealistic scenario at the moment "
