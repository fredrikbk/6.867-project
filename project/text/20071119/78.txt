weak dollar isnt the inflation driver it once was inflation warnings are sounding in the u s because of the plunging dollar but they may be false alarms evidence has been building that a weak dollar doesnt fuel inflation like it used to a key reason foreign exporters are so keen to keep u s market share that when the dollar weakens they often lower their prices to keep them steady in dollar terms thats especially true when the economy is slowing and american consumers are less willing to pay higher prices a decline in the dollars value the drop seen over the past year might be expected to raise the price of imports by but the actual increase has been much less studies have found that only one quarter to one tenth of a currency depreciation gets passed through as higher prices for foreign made goods that makes the federal reserves job a bit easier during uncertain times if the nations economy slows sharply the fed could give it a boost by lowering interest rates a move that tends to weaken the dollar even more without worrying as much about inflation last month fed chairman ben bernanke said that while the weaker dollar leads to "some inflationary effect" as imports costs rise "our experience over the recent decade has been that those effects are relatively small " the feds job is to balance growth and inflation and few economists believe it should act simply to preserve the dollars value moreover for fed policy makers the weak dollar has had a timely benefit it boosts u s exports by making american goods cheaper abroad that helps ease the pain of the housing slump and credit crunch "right now theyre going to view this as good not bad " says brandeis university professor stephen cecchetti "there are no tangible inflation risks that are coming out of it " markets seem to agree the dollars five year decline hasnt raised inflation expectations as expressed by the bond market prices of gold oil and other commodities have surged but much of the cause has been growing demand and speculation in financial markets a recent study by fed staffers found that many foreign companies sending goods to the u s have given the american consumer special treatment as the dollar has fallen those companies have accepted thinner profit margins especially since they havent given consumers elsewhere a similar break that reflects the dollars dominance and concerns about losing ground in a key market even if the weak dollar has only a modest impact on inflation however it still poses risks core inflation which excludes food and energy prices has remained tame in recent months within some fed officials to comfort zone but the dollars drop could boost the publics inflation expectations sparking a self fulfilling bout of price increases the dollars decline also could create a communications problem for fed officials whose policy decisions arent aimed at the dollar but can still depress the currency "it sets the market backdrop which your policy actions will be interpreted against " said vincent reinhart a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and former head of the feds monetary affairs division "people might get confused as to why exactly youre easing policy " a weakening dollar used to have a bigger impact on import prices from the mid s through the s the pass through rate was as high as meaning a drop in the value of the dollar would raise import prices by this decade the pass through rate has been less than for the overall economy thats still a small increase because imports are a fraction of the goods consumed of the roughly &# trillion of products the u s imported last year more than a third came from asia compared with the euro asian currencies have remained far more stable against the dollar partly because some asian countries like china manage their currencies to hold down their value in many cases too markups can make importers costs for goods from china just a fraction of the ultimate prices charged to u s consumers the companies bringing goods into the u s have the choice of "eating it in their margin or jacking up their price when the exchange rate moves " mr cecchetti says how a falling dollar affects imports can depend on the product involved the prices of some luxury imports such as bmw autos have stayed steady as their makers have accepted lower profits airlines however run on thinner margins and are quicker to raise ticket prices if their costs rise in addition price increases on raw materials including steel and other commodities tend to pass through at much higher rates or more in part because they are priced globally and tend to affect rivals equally some economists question how long companies that are squeezed by the falling dollar will accept weaker profits joel popkin an economist who analyzes price trends at popkin &amp co says some importers are starting to seek price increases as their costs rise "i think were seeing it now " he said "if oil continues on its path were going to see more pass through from oil than weve seen before says joel popkin a private economist who analyzes price trends "youre starting to get to the point where the costs cant be absorbed " other economists are keeping a sharp eye out for dollar induced inflation even as they note that their economic models suggest little reason to worry "were not blind to the risk that something may have changed " says lehman brothers economist drew matus "you can never really tell the regime shifts until its too late " that poses another challenge for the fed identifying the elusive point at which companies abroad might decide it costs too much to give american consumers preferential treatment
