women to watch a special report view from the top women executives talk about their careers the importance of mentoring and work life balance whats it like for a woman at the top how have the few who have gotten there charted their careers have they been helped by mentors along the way and how do they mentor others and is work family balance possible to answer these and other questions the wall street journal invited six women executives to participate in a recent panel discussion moderated by senior editor carol hymowitz the discussion which took place before an audience of about invited guests offers an inside look at the special challenges and choices of women at the top here are edited excerpts from their discussion the wall street journal all of you have worked at more than one company and some of you in the public sector as well what has prompted some of your moves sheryl sandberg i wanted to go into technology because i thought that was where the most interesting things were happening this was after the dot com bubble crashed google was not the obvious choice then there were people who said "youre going to a little technology company dont you know thats over " i was passionate about what google does which is provide free information to the world but the job offer i had was to be a business manager and at the time there was no business to manage i told ceo eric schmidt "this job meets none of my criteria " and he gave me what i think was the best career advice ive ever gotten he said "go where theres growth because growth provides opportunities " and i came to google and it was a great decision melanie healey i was a marketing manager at johnson &amp johnson in brazil when i got a call from procter &amp gamble p&amp g is a company that only hires at entry level positions i ended up going as a brand manager which was a step back it was a questionable move but i thought about something different than the level of my job j&amp j had been in brazil at the time for or years and here was p&amp g a big multinational but then a very small start up in this huge country full of opportunities and i thought this is the challenge i want this is where im going to learn the most in the next few years wsj angela braly you were a lawyer in private practice when you worked out a settlement for a for profit health company over claims that it was benefiting from its nonprofit parent was this a pivotal job angela braly yes thats right reaching an agreement is always about collaboration which i think is a skill women have one thing that motivated me after the case was settled was a really good friend of mine said "that was probably the most interesting and exciting thing youll ever do in your career " and i thought im going to make sure that isnt the case the value of collaboration was the lesson for me there and it gave me the confidence to think about what might be the most challenging thing i could do michele coleman mayes sometimes ive been called the rebel within companies so in deciding to move to allstate one of my questions for the ceo was "are you sure you want me " someone said "oh youll be a breath of fresh air " but i said "or a tornado and insurance companies dont like tornados " but this job is a new challenge it isnt more of the same and that is what i was looking for " billie williamson i had spent almost years with ernst &amp young as an auditor in accounting and quite frankly i was bored to death so i joined a high tech company as the cfo and we did a venture capital recapitalization and then took the company public i moved from there to marriott international as the senior vice president of finance and then i came back to e&amp y in a very strategic position leaving for a while gave me the credentials to be a business executive not just an accountant mary sammons i would encourage everyone to get out of your comfort zone and be willing to take risks i started out to teach french and then couldnt get a teaching job because none was available so i answered an ad to work for a retail company fred meyer stores it was the furthest thing from what i thought i would do with my life and initially they hired me on probation for days and i learned very quickly that there were so many ways i could fulfill myself in business and then years later in when the opportunity came to go to rite aid i faced both a professional and personal decision to go to a very troubled company when i already had a really good job and to move from the west coast where all my family lives to camp hill pa but going to rite aid gave me the chance to do something that could make a difference for the company and a lot of people who worked for it and did business with it wsj how important is finding and being a mentor ms mayes its plural it isnt dessert you need more than one ive found that the people who really get to know you well see things in you that you cannot see in yourself and if you think youre perfect you probably just havent met the right person to tell you the truth you need to think of an image where your hands are stretched both ways i dont care how old you are youre always looking for someone when you need help and there is always somebody thats been there before you and youd better pay it forward meaning you reach back and you help somebody else ms sandberg you need different kinds of mentors for different parts of your life professional and personal i think the best mentor mentee relationships are based on really knowing the person in some mutual interest so at work the best way for me to develop people is to engage with them substantively on an issue a better question than "can you help me " is "i have this problem and id love your views on this " mentors arent stamps you cant collect them indiscriminately you have to really develop those relationships ms williamson at e&amp y we dont have enough women to be mentors to all of the women who are coming into our firm so we need help from our male partners and were encouraging them to be more actively involved were also teaching men at our firm about how to sell to women a good friend of mine works at a very large company on the west coast and one of our male partners was trying to sell her some business and he kept calling me and telling me he wasnt getting to first base i asked him how he was approaching this woman and after he gave me his list of what hed done i said "you havent asked her for her input about anything " i suggested he go back to her with a plain proposal marked "draft " he took my suggestion and sold the job ms braly billie you should probably tell him not to say that hes trying to get to first base with women ms sammons i think the idea of a "draft" works well with things you send to male customers too wsj just of senior managers are women why is this the case and what in your background helped you keep advancing ms healey we have to change corporate cultures but we also have to be aware of biases we unconsciously have outside the work force my husband is a stay at home dad weve lived in brazil mexico venezuela and now cincinnati p&amp gs headquarters when we first moved to our current neighborhood the talk of the street was "oh theres a stay at home dad i wonder what thats going to be like should we invite him to the book club " as long as we still live in a society that thinks this way it doesnt make it easy for women and frankly men to make the kind of bold decisions that enable a different kind of environment that promotes more women what helped me as i look back on my career is first of all i had an amazing mom who was terrific at tough love and also a family environment that drove and pushed me to go after my dreams and certainly one of my dreams having come from a very multicultural background my father is english my mother grandmother and great grandmother are chilean i was born in brazil and my kids were born in mexico was to give my kids the same opportunity to experience different cultures the point is dont just think about your profession think about your entire life wsj michele mayes does stereotyping still hold women back ms mayes women are put into this box that i call the four h club what the four hs stand for are a womans hair hips hemline and husband you rarely hear any of these for a man and of course you expect his wife to be at home so theres this unconscious bias stuff swimming around when people are interviewing others for positions they think to themselves "this woman cant travel " or "shes married shes not going to want to move " or "shes going to want to have kids so therefore wont be available " the only way you get around the stereotypes is to make sure people get to know you and what you want ms sandberg theres a harvard business school case about a woman named heidi roizen who moved to silicon valley and used her interpersonal relationships to become a very successful venture capitalist a business professor at stanford last year took that case and changed the name to howard so then she had two cases the howard roizen and the heidi roizen case and polled her students when she asked "is this person competent " heidi and howard came out even historically i believe that is new a huge step forward from and certainly years ago but when the professor asked "do you want to work with this person and do you like this person " howard did a lot better than heidi who was seen as out for herself and too aggressive so theres still some room to improve how people see women who are working hard at their careers versus men ive become more attuned to this a woman who is a rock star who works for my team at google was going to have a baby and i had a baby a few years prior to her so i took her to lunch and said "i want this to work for you im doing this myself and we dont want to lose you " and she looked at me and said "you do well then stop sending out emails at at night " what she was saying was "look you can take me out for lunch and be nice but as long as youre sending out emails at at night everyone thinks you need a response by the morning " so we have to think not just about what we say but about what we do ms braly i think we need to understand that to be in the positions were in involves a lot of hard work an email is a controversial thing weve had a whole debate in our company about making sure people know you dont have to respond by midnight because sometimes you get that "ping ping" back right away and thats not the point of an email the point in my life is that i chose to go home for dinner with my family instead of staying at the office till or oclock then im doing my emails late at night because thats what is required for me to get the job done the way i want to so everybody has to know that were going to do it in different ways wsj angela braly you head a company where of your employees are women as are of your managers and one third of your board is the culture different ms braly sometimes i think we take for granted the strength and number of women at wellpoint were really privileged to have this mix and we share a lot in common there are a lot of women i work with whose husbands have chosen to stay at home we see a lot of women be successful when we talk about developing a network in our company we think maybe we need to develop a mens network so the men can stay connected because the womens network happens pretty naturally wsj mary sammons in companies youve worked in where men were the majority of managers was there a lot of informal male networking on the golf course or after work that women were excluded from ms sammons those networks are still there theres a positive side for women you can stay at work get good results and while the men are still playing golf youre running the company but its unfortunate to me that male networks are still so prevalent i think it shows up on a lot of boards so the question comes up do you actively go out and look for women for your board i know i did wsj is work life balance possible when you are in a top executive job ms healey i would say you cant have it all at one time but you probably can have just about most of what you want over time if youre willing to make the right choices and the measurement i use is to ask myself "am i happy am i having fun " as long as the answer is yes then im fine with a sometimes even a hour day but if the answer is no thats when i stop and rethink my choices it is a lot of stress theres no doubt about it i dont think you can ever expect to get into a job like this and think its going to be a smooth ride but at the end of the day its your life and you want to have a good one another measure for me is "are my kids feeling like im happy " because if i came home every day and felt like i was showing them misery that wouldnt be healthy for them either wsj angela braly you like melanie healey have a stay at home husband was this something that evolved over the course of your marriage ms braly we have three children and when they were babies i was the one who owned parenting in a more direct way then when i had the chance to go to wellpoints headquarters in indianapolis we together made the decision to move from where wed lived before for my husbands job with his familys business we were also moving the kids for the first time in their lives and they were approaching high school so it was pretty traumatic now theyre happy as clams but you wouldve never thought it we were going to ruin their lives moving them now we cant get them to go back to their former home because theyre too busy but my husband really made it possible for me to think about what life was going to be like with him taking the responsibility for the kids and i so appreciate the choice that hes made and hes so good at it i think this is where were really sexist we think "how is this going to work " and its fabulous it works really well ms sandberg one of the really big issues is how do you make this work for everyone how do you make it work for people who havent risen to senior executive ranks google provides day care now it got oversubscribed quickly so were busy opening up more centers and we havent yet met all the demands even though were close and theres a lot to think about for men too it can be as hard for a man as for a woman to say "im leaving at " one of the reasons women drop out of the work force is theyre doing more at home and thats still largely true in my generation finding ways to help not just women but also men have balance so they can do their share so their wives can be successful is an important part of the equation ms sammons i think we all need to learn to have the courage to bring up issues that may be hard to bring up it isnt always easy to talk to someone about the fact that you should be paid more or the fact that you believe a situation hasnt been dealt with correctly by a senior manager but its important that people you work with understand when theyve created a situation thats unfair when you look at where women have gotten in the workplace and the pay inequities that still exist in a lot of industries i think we have to take the bull by the horns and ask about that very directly in our companies wsj billie williamson what is e&amp y doing in a formal way to help women advance ms williamson were trying to create an environment where flexibility is the norm rather than something abnormal or different were also coaching young women to build relationships with clients and get involved in business development thats where women tend to freeze they love doing the technical work but say they dont know how to sell and were trying to make sure women managers have the right opportunities were looking at what clients they are assigned to and who theyre working with one third of our new partners last year were women which is a very high percentage and we want to sustain that ms mayes billie i just have to say this it may not be politic dont assume just because your manager is a woman that youre on the same page ms williamson absolutely youre right wsj mary sammons and angela braly you are both ceos of very large companies what has been the most surprising part of your jobs ms sammons the most surprising thing for me when i came to rite aid was not knowing what i didnt know i came in thinking i could just put my operational plan in place and get everything moving and then i discovered there was no money i was looking at the cash sheet every day just to make sure there was a little bit of cash there and i quickly understood i couldnt stick with my plan because it costs money to remodel a store or do more advertising so i spent my first months in the field just talking to associates in our stores and distribution centers and built the best kind of network with everyone who deals with customers i also spent time with suppliers it didnt cost me money to do that and i learned a lot of the things that helped me later when finances improved ms braly whats been most interesting to me about becoming a ceo was the amount of surprise there was about me being chosen women are out there working very hard although not necessarily promoting themselves in the same way as some male colleagues so when we pop up people say "oh thats surprising you came out of nowhere " well because you had your head down wsj do women keep their heads down too much ms williamson i think were very focused on going through the to do list and finishing the job then i wanted to go home and take care of my child and family so i didnt invest enough time in building relationships with people at different levels i do that today but i wish id known to do it earlier wsj some of you do a lot of global business are there vast differences or similarities among the women customers you sell to around the world ms healey were in a much more interconnected world today and one thing ive found and ill use feminine protection products as an example since most of the people in this room are women is the degree of similarity feminine protection at p&amp g is always and tampax and if you go around the world you find the way every teenager learns about her period is through her mother sister or friends its the same everywhere and whether women have a positive or negative attitude is very much because of how their mother sister or friends talked to them we tend to focus on global differences but if you go into different countries looking for similarities you can create huge business opportunities ms mayes i mentored a year old woman from lebanon she told me shed been afraid to come to the u s because of our differences first i was a lawyer and she was a creative director and she doesnt think lawyers are creative second i was substantially older than she and finally she said "i thought you might think i was nothing more than a terrorist " i spent days with her and we bonded in so many ways so i say find the common ground wsj some of you have daughters and you all have women in your lives you care about whats the one piece of advice youd give them ms mayes dont defeat yourself arianna huffington quoted a french philosopher who said it in a much wiser way than i have he said "many terrible things have happened in my life but most of them never occurred " ms healey you can choose to have the right attitude or the wrong attitude and if you choose to have the right attitude life is just much better ms braly i would say to my daughter who is going to rule the world one day i think dont be mediocre choose to do your best at what you can do and have a good time doing it ms sammons i go back to something i said in the very beginning get out of your comfort zone even if it doesnt all work out the way you want it to youll be better prepared for the next thing that comes along ms sandberg do things you care about its more interesting more intrinsically valuable ms williamson have confidence in your own abilities audience question how do you as leaders in the private sector view your responsibility to the public sector ms healey i think you can sometimes marry the public and private we have a program with always and tampax in africa girls in africa miss a week of school a month because they get their periods and dont have the protection they need so when we think about making periods more positive to women were also thinking about how to improve womens lives enabling these girls to go to school by building bathrooms and giving them products is a way we can make a big difference audience question what can you tell us about your failures have you had any ms sammons if any one of us from the day we started working didnt have some failures it would mean we didnt take any risks at all ive had a couple of instances in my career where i was asked to go back and do something of a lesser level of work and i think i made those decisions wisely because if you are willing to move back at some point and then demonstrate a success then you have another opportunity and you learn even more when you work on something a second time that will make you a better leader in the future
