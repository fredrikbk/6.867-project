small business link tech company stems departures by listening to employees needs as recently as three years ago of the employees at technology company protus ip solutions inc quit annually perhaps worse chief executive officer joseph nour wasnt sure why though employees usually completed exit interviews notes from those conversations often were shoved into a drawer mr nour realized it was time for change these days protus based in ottawa has employees and turnover is about annually one quarter what it was three years ago step one in stemming the problem says mr nour was hiring janice vanderburg as director of human resources from a bigger more established employer ms vanderburg says she walked into a company lacking in structure and processes one example some employees were eligible for profit sharing incentive pay and didnt know it no one had explained it to them such growing pains are a common pitfall for young companies the closer companies get to the employee mark the more complicated managing them becomes says brian wilkerson national practice director for talent management in denver for watson wyatt a human resources consulting company he says making sure good employees move up rather than move on is important for a smaller company where every worker can have an impact on the organization upgrading talent management can be a make or break for a growing company ms vanderburg started surveying employees within six months of her arrival a practice she had used at her former employer and its through this process that protus learned the main reasons for its dismal retention track record employees were asked in the survey if they understood the companys direction and what protus could be doing better some sections invited open ended comments many respondents reported that they didnt understand what was expected of them often they indicated problems communicating with managers and despite the companys growth many employees had no idea how to move to a different position or group so ms vanderburg started stressing to managers the importance of promoting from within and getting away from a start up mentality which tends to look for talent on the outside she has pushed managers to spend more time coaching employees helping good performers move to new positions and trying to minimize poor performance not every manager appreciates the direction though few want "to have the tough conversations " she says now entry level employees on the help desk a high turnover area are asked where theyd like to work after they learn the ropes a handful have moved on to technology support or sales jobs and other employees see their progress key to tracking employees and helping them to move up the ranks has been protuss use of performance management software after three months on the job new employees are reviewed and the results are entered into online forms so are results for annual reviews and as part of the process employees are asked where they see themselves in a few years "weve gone from completing a performance review to investing in performance " ms vanderburg says even pay levels are now data driven the company once paid an employee what felt like a fair salary now ms vanderburg pores over data from similar companies and industries "i can defend a salary to an employee who questions it in a research based manner " she says as a result employees are more confident that theyre being paid fairly ms vanderburg says while spending on budget items such as a human resources executives salary and performance management software can be relatively easy to justify the value of "soft skill hr initiatives" like coaching for performance is often harder for small companies to recognize so protus relies on its employee retention and satisfaction survey data to show how those efforts are paying off
