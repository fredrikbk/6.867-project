women to watch a special report the women to watch  angela braly president and chief executive wellpoint five months into her job as wellpoint inc s chief executive angela braly was on a three week tour rallying the troops at the health insurance behemoths operations across states on the agenda that morning giving a pep talk to managers at the companys empire blue cross blue shield plan in new york along with other insurers empire had recently come under fire from the states attorney general over whether its planned doctor rating programs simply tried to steer members to less expensive physicians ms braly told the assembled managers that despite the flak the company had been getting measuring physicians would help guide consumers just as other wellpoint initiatives had like selling less expensive plans to the uninsured and providing counseling for people who need complex and costly specialty drugs several weeks later as if to underline ms bralys point her company reached an agreement with the new york attorney general on criteria that empire will use in measuring and disclosing physicians performance "part of the reason were a lightning rod is that we have to be the disciplinarians around health care costs " ms braly said in a recent interview "but we have to remind our employees how theyre making a difference in peoples lives were in a very personal business " the year old ms braly sees rousing wellpoints employees with her can do pluck as no small part of her job as the health insurance giants new ceo she has become arguably the most powerful woman in corporate america this year with &# billion in annual sales and nearly million members in its blue cross blue shield plans across the country wellpoint is the countrys largest health insurer ms bralys position also makes her one of the most powerful voices in the ongoing health care debate as the number of americas uninsured climbs toward million and the momentum for health reform intensifies ms braly will play a big role in shaping the debate her most critical task will be protecting her companys interests and profits in the face of growing pressure for a larger government role in health care and showing how wellpoint is making a difference in health care for the better "a politician once told me know who you are because a lot of people will tell you what you should be " she says "we need to know who we are as a company and we need to be a company that delivers value and can prove it " that challenge helps explain how ms braly was picked for the ceo job general counsel and government affairs strategist before the promotion she was chosen over several more senior and more visible executives her appointment announced in february took wall street by surprise but her public relations savvy and ability to court legislators and regulators not to mention her hands on experience running a health plan made it clear to the board that she was "what wellpoint needed going forward " a person close to the selection process says as the debate around reforming americas inefficient and increasingly unaffordable health care system grows louder its not just fans of michael moores "sicko" who have the health insurance industry in their sights a key part of gov arnold schwarzeneggers proposal for universal coverage in california would try to cap insurers profits by requiring them to spend at least of premiums they collect on patient care the subsidies that managed care companies are paid to provide private medicare plans have come under repeated attack in congress this year as being far too generous and as the country heads into the presidential election season the candidates are escalating the rhetoric with their own plans to fix the system sen hillary clintons plan in particular has called for safeguards that require private insurers to accept everyone who applies including the very sick or those seen at risk of becoming ill and bars private insurers from charging large differences in premiums because of age gender or occupation a mother of three ms braly has a personable nature that belies her steeliness and skill as a tough minded negotiator colleagues and acquaintances say shes also firm on where wellpoint stands on the issues while she promotes a blend of private and public initiatives to expand health care coverage she says a private system is necessary to inject the innovation and competition needed to improve the system shes a big believer in letting consumers determine the level of coverage they can afford she also says implementing mandates to require individuals to have health insurance is an ineffective way to force people to buy coverage in california wellpoint is one of the few major insurers to oppose the schwarzenegger plan to make insurers accept all applicants "we want to fix whats broken not fix what isnt broken " ms braly says "i like to characterize her as soccer mom on one hand and napoleonic soldier on the other " says john orourke a former wellpoint regional president and former ceo of rightchoice managed care inc a missouri blue cross blue shield plan operator acquired by wellpoint in mr orourke who is now retired hired ms braly as rightchoice general counsel in the entree to her swift rise at wellpoint "some people get fooled and they dont perceive her as tough " mr orourke says "but she is " she also leads a highly profitable and powerful company wellpoint became the countrys largest health insurer in with the merger of anthem inc and wellpoint health networks the companys two biggest operators of for profit blue cross and blue shield plans with &# billion in market capitalization wellpoints earnings totaled more than &# billion last year up from &# billion in and are on track to rise this year its the largest health insurer in of states where it operates including california virginia new york georgia and much of the midwest and typically controls at least one third of its markets its broad networks large array of health plan products and well known blue brand have helped wellpoint grow more than most rivals but as many smaller employers struggle to provide health benefits and fewer individuals are able to afford coverage on their own the company has struggled against the same stagnant growth in the commercial market as the rest of the industry has last month wellpoint trimmed its enrollment projections for the year to a net increase of just new members its original forecast had been for million new members ms braly a dallas native studied law at southern methodist university but moved to st louis because of her husbands job in his familys trucking business in st louis she eventually became partner at lewis rice &amp fingersh lc a prominent local law firm she planned to "practice law forever " she says but then was assigned in to act as interim counsel to blue cross blue shield of missouri to help in a messy legal and political battle to convert the plan to for profit status one of her mentors at lewis rice cautioned her not to devote more than a year to the imbroglio but "i became so invested in it " she says "i felt we were really striving to do the right thing " ms braly won over regulators and community groups with a deal to set up a foundation that would finance health care for uninsured missourians "she knows how to build coalitions around her " says kathy osborn executive director of the regional business council in st louis ms braly was adamant that the foundation disperse grants for projects that the state wasnt already addressing such as dental care in the boot heel region in southeast missouri since it began the foundation has distributed more than &# million in grants to those kinds of nonprofits ms braly became the in house general counsel of rightchoice the parent company of blue cross blue shield of missouri in then after wellpoint acquired rightchoice in she was appointed ceo of wellpoints missouri unit from there she played a key advisory role in overcoming political and regulatory hurdles to the merger with anthem and after that deal wellpoint ceo larry glasscock asked her to move to wellpoints indianapolis headquarters as corporate general counsel she consulted her former boss mr orourke about moving her family there "i told her if you go to indianapolis you will some day be running the whole thing " mr orourke says "it didnt surprise me shes got the perfect profile for a health insurance ceo " ms braly says shes more amazed than annoyed by the buzz that surrounded her appointment to the top post many on wall street had thought then finance chief david colby or john watts president of wellpoints consumer and commercial business would get the job "the biggest surprise was the surprise that i got it this idea that oh you came out of nowhere " she says "the reality is that there are so many women who are doing their jobs and doing it very effectively " a day before she took the helm she and outgoing ceo mr glasscock had to announce another surprise management shakeup mr colby the finance chief had agreed to resign because of an undisclosed code of conduct violation it later emerged that mr colby was entangled in multiple romantic relationships including one with a former employee an attorney for mr colby said he and his client declined to comment despite initial investor concerns that mr colbys departure would leave wellpoint with a void at the top ms braly announced a further reorganization last month the new structure is cleaner and allows it to sell more of its products to a wider range of its customers such as vision and dental benefits to members in its traditional health plans the new plan also made clear that three other high level executives from wellpoints old guard would go through with their planned retirements or departures over the next year "shes not afraid to deal with tough challenges " says randy brown wellpoints chief human resources officer "she deals with the reality that she has not the reality that shed like " she has also set the tone for wellpoints family friendly culture with her husband now a stay at home dad ms braly is known for her stamina and for keeping a busy schedule visiting wellpoint employees customers and hospital systems around the country still wellpoints board rescheduled a board meeting earlier this year so she could attend her daughters fourth grade play and earlier this month ms braly skipped the monthly dinner with her top management team because it was her daughters birthday "she sets the tone for the rest of us to do the same with our kids " mr brown says ms braly says establishing wellpoint as a friendly partner to consumers in health care is key to its success the company last month announced it would team up with zagat a purveyor of consumers restaurant and hotel ratings to let health plan members go online to rate and review their experiences with doctors beginning this year the company also is tying a portion of bonuses for managers and employees to improvements in the health of its million plan members wellpoint has an index that measures how well and how often patients receive recommended screenings preventive care and monitor chronic conditions bonuses are determined in part by changes in the overall health index score in california meanwhile the company has taken an active role in the debate over gov schwarzeneggers proposal for universal health care coverage earlier this year wellpoint launched a &# million advertising campaign in the state to warn that aspects of the schwarzenegger plan such as forcing insurers to take on any customer could make coverage more unaffordable "its hard to see why theyre in such strong opposition stance " given that the governors proposal still gives health insurers a lot of breaks and outs says jerry flanagan a consumer advocate at the california based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights ms braly for her part says wellpoint is just taking a position thats based on its experience with reform in other states "a lot of the same ideas around reform have been tried " she says "and we think we can bring to the dialogue what works and what may not work "
