why a funds piety is now paying off islamic principles help amana income avoid banks other risky bets the little known mutual fund amana income fund is one of this years top performers it can thank islamic law for that the amana fund is a specialized fund that invests based on islamic religious principles that means it must avoid among other things investing in banks or other firms that earn money by charging interest nor can it invest in companies carrying lots of debt this year these restrictions are paying off the fund which seeks well established companies paying dividends has largely avoided the mortgage related carnage hitting the markets since the summer the amana income fund has returned since the start of this year and is ranked in the top of its category with shares of many banks and brokerage houses having plunged amid concerns over losses on mortgage related securities the average stock income fund is up only according to fund tracker lipper inc "its good that you dont have banks and financial companies in periods like this year " says nicholas kaiser of saturna capital corp bellingham wash which manages the amana funds "its great to be out of it " indeed most mutual funds that invest based on islamic principles have largely weathered the recent credit turmoil two islamic funds offered by azzad asset management smaller than the amana and its &# million of assets also are beating the standard &amp poors stock index since the start of this year after trailing the broad market for several years dow jones islamic fund is up year to date which ranks it in the top of its category of large market capitalization stocks the fund managed by allied asset advisors tracks the dow jones islamic market index which is a product of dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal a sister amana fund amana growth fund isnt doing quite as well the fund has &# million of assets and invests in companies whose earnings are expected to rise faster than the broader market it has returned this year while that beats the broader market it still trails its growth type peers by percentage points mr kaiser says the fund is basically looking for growth stocks that have such "value" characteristics as "reasonable" share price to earnings multiples but this year the best performers were highflying stocks like google inc "so some of our stocks didnt do well this year " he says apart from financial stocks islamic funds like other faith based funds also screen out so called sin stocks including alcohol tobacco gambling and weapons makers they also must shun companies in pork processing businesses and companies with a debt level higher or equal to these rules eliminate from consideration about half of all the publicly traded stocks in the u s out of the russell index which includes the largest u s companies based on market capitalization and represents about of u s stocks amana has about companies to choose from by comparison kld research &amp analytics a social investing research firm contains stocks in its broad index faith based or socially conscious mutual funds there are numerous varieties tend to underperform the broader market that is often because their blanket prohibition of certain sectors means they automatically rule out some good performing stocks at the same time the added stock picking research required by their social or religious criteria increases the cost of running such funds amana funds have been a powerful rebuttal to this notion in the past five years both are among the top returning funds in their respective categories returning about on an annualized basis some of amanas investment rules for instance low turnover in buying and selling stocks and aversion to debt make investing sense for long term investors says david kathman an analyst with morningstar inc because of the low debt restriction amana has found some good investments its growth fund started buying washington group international inc a construction firm in january at &# a share after mr kaiser spotted its zero debt level "this looks good for us " he recalls saying amana recently sold the stock at &# after the shares rallied on a takeover offer the islamic rules have helped amana dodge some bullets enron corp which then fit growth fund criteria was ruled out from amana growth funds holdings before the scandal was exposed because its debt level exceeded the threshold mr kaiser says saturna capital uses guidelines set up and endorsed by the fiqh council of north america an organization of religious scholars dealing with issues concerning muslims in north america islamic law also forbids frequent trading of shares since that is seen as a form of gambling as a result the turnover in the portfolios at amana funds averages around just each year compared with or more at a typical mutual fund lack of turnover is a contributor to performance since shareholders are taxed for capital gains when managers sell stocks and make gains and because of lower trading fees the year old mr kaiser who isnt muslim himself is concerned about the subprime spillover to his funds as a big part of the u s economy "is based on home buying and loans thats going to drop off quite a bit " he says leading people to cut consumption in retails and gasoline "we have a lot of those stocks in our portfolios if we have a major recession i dont think we are immune from it just because we are not in those financial sectors " he said amanas consistent performance appears to be attracting more non muslim investors in the past months the two funds have increased from &# million in assets to more than &# billion combined of course it is impossible to know for certain the religious persuasion of any given investor in a mutual fund but by their names "we can pretty much tell they are non muslims " mr kaiser says "they just went for performance "
