blitzing the fcc everyone knows the national football league is full of tough guys but that doesnt mean team owners are above whining to federal regulators when they dont get their way off the field the league is currently upset that its eponymous television channel the nfl network isnt getting wide distribution on basic cable instead time warner and comcast want to offer the network as part of their less popular sports tier of programming the first nfl network game of the season is on thanksgiving and the cable firms show no signs of giving in to the leagues demands the industry maintains that the nfl is charging cable companies too much money for them to offer the network on their basic tier without increasing subscription rates dallas cowboys owner jerry jones whose team plays twice this season on the channel has taken to calling for pigskin fans to drop cable operators and switch to satellite television which runs a special package of nfl games each week perhaps the very prosperous league would do better to negotiate more favorable carriage terms with time warner and comcast though we suppose mr jones has every right to engage in a pr war if he thinks itll help his bargaining position more troubling is the nfls attempt to involve government regulators in what is essentially a commercial dispute the league has taken its complaints to the federal communications commission in hopes that the agency will force the hand of cable operators a media campaign against cable is one thing but seeking regulatory leverage in a private sector dispute is unsportsman like conduct we trust the fcc knows the difference and will respond accordingly
