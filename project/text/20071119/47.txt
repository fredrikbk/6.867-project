opecs divisions rise to surface members differ on the role of cartel best price for oil nod to emissions concerns riyadh saudi arabia sky high crude oil prices are fueling an economic boom here and in other oil capitals at the same time they are reigniting old divisions within opec and stirring fresh doubts about the future role of the worlds premier oil supply cartel the oil czars of the member group who met for a rare heads of state summit here over the weekend have enjoyed an extraordinary run up in crude prices over the past eight years that so far has done surprisingly little to blunt either the global economys run of growth or its thirst for oil but myriad anxieties have bubbled up during this weekends talks on fronts ranging from global warming and the weakness of the dollar to the cartels own ability to exert muscle over a fickle oil market subject to increasing fund flows from wall street ministers and their deputies eyeing signs of an economic slump in the u s also appeared reluctant to answer calls in the west for increased supplies when they meet at an opec policy meeting early next month for all their perceived clout leaders of the organization of petroleum exporting countries stressed how powerless they are to affect oil prices which have swung this year from a settlement low of about &# a barrel in january to a closing high of &# this month on friday the december contract for light sweet crude oil closed at &# up &# on the new york mercantile exchange several ministers along with opec secretary general abdalla salem el badri called for studies into the sway that investment funds have over the oil market officials suggested ways should be found to mitigate the influence of the financial markets over crude prices there was little however in the way of concrete proposals recent price fluctuations mr badri said in an interview were due to "oil becoming a financial asset " while opecs leverage is limited "all we can do is oversupply the market or undersupply the market " he said the latter is certainly true but opec which supplies some of the worlds oil has a much tougher time pushing production higher only saudi arabia is known to have significant spare capacity on hand opec leaders and ministers have differed on whether current prices are justified saudi oil minister ali naimi the cartels de facto leader suggested he would prefer to see prices come down and his counterpart in the united arab emirates mohammad al hamli called current price levels "potentially dangerous " the venezuelans and iranians however defended recent prices as fair a state dinner hosted saturday night by saudi king abdullah offered a gilt edged backdrop for another long festering debate should the year old cartel serve mainly as steward of the worlds economy or as a political champion for developing countries venezuelan president hugo chavez called for a return of the s style "revolutionary opec " the group he said in a speech before the dinner must stand up to industrialized powers like the u s and become "a much stronger player in the geopolitical arena " saudi arabia the cartels driving force and the worlds single largest oil exporter has worked hard in recent years to strip opec of its inner bickering and political grandstanding and to turn it into a more professional organization none of the gulf oil powers want to revive the old feuds between oil producers and consumers so it was little surprise that king abdullah calmly combated mr chavezs view telling the assembly of presidents ministers and royalty that opec "has always acted moderately and wisely " oil he said "shouldnt be a tool for conflict " still venezuela has its ideological supporters in both iran and ecuador which returned to the opec fold this weekend ecuadors president rafael correa told reporters that "opec needs a political vision to manage a strategic resource " in his remarks yesterday to reporters iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad railed against the unnamed powers that have "plotted very complex plots to loot the energy resources of other nations " mr chavez predicted that if the u s "was crazy enough" to attack iran in coming months because of irans refusal to halt its nuclear program oil prices would hit &# a barrel but mr ahmadinejad yesterday said he didnt believe there would be a military conflict between the u s and iran one looming skirmish which was successfully put off by the saudis concerns the future role of the u s dollar as the central currency in the oil trade venezuela and iran pushed here to raise concerns over the dollar in the summits final communique saudi foreign minister saud al faisal rebuffed the effort saying in a closed meeting of ministers that "the mere mention that the opec countries are studying the issue of the dollar" could have a damaging impact on the value of the dollar oil countries have expressed concerns recently that the falling dollar has eroded their earnings and foreign currency reserves in the end the group agreed to turn the subject over to a working group of finance ministers the issue could return early next month when opec oil ministers meet for a formal policy session opec leaders did agree to make a nod toward growing concerns over global warming and fossil fuel emissions saudi arabia and three of its gulf neighbors united arab emirates qatar and kuwait put a total of &# million into a fund to support research into technology to take emissions out of the atmosphere and inject them back into the earth that technology is in its infancy
