who guards the custodians responses to justice oconnor regarding "justice for sale" by sandra day oconnor op ed nov i share justice oconnors concerns about the politicization of judges in my view the problem began with the rise of consequentialist moral philosophy in law schools in a nutshell this approach to moral philosophy holds that right and wrong is about ultimate effects it is not about following the rules or obeying moral principles the problem is that the founding fathers were largely non consequentialists this means our constitution was written by men who presumed that law would be interpreted by judges in a principled manner they were not however so naive as to think that politics would be so principled of course in any case once law schools began actively inculcating an ethic of non consequentialism each subsequent generation of judges became more comfortable with the idea that greater good rationalizations are morally and legally respectable this opened the door for judicial activism with the rise of judicial activism however a more direct route opened up this route was first taken largely by liberal activists after three decades of this conservative activists got tired of what they perceived to be an increasingly rigged game so now they are joining in so the problem isnt politics per se but in this case politics is a symptom of a deeper problem having judges who issue decisions more because of their own desire to effectuate an outcome than because of what is required by a principled reading of the law if we are to remain a country of laws and not men this is a frightening development but the solution is not to lament that conservative activists are no longer taking it on the chin the solution is to begin turning back the tide of consequentialist moral philosophy in americas law schools david c rose professor and chair department of economics university of missouri st louis st louis the problem with americas judiciary is not that public special interest groups are playing too great a role in judicial elections the problem is that americas judiciary tries to do too much in terms of governing and justice oconnor was party to that problem when in effect she and a majority of the court decided that they knew better than the referees of a sport the pga tour and decided that the americans with disabilities act allowed golfer casey martin to ride a golf cart in tournament play when the sports rules forbade it what i say therefore to justice oconnor is that children might have more respect for "their teachers their parents and their sports referees" if they knew that those authority figures would not be routinely second guessed and overruled by activist courts charles d brown ann arbor mich the real issue is whether states with elected judges have systems of justice as good as those with justice oconnors recommended system if so why change i have been practicing law for over years in a state which has that "independent commission of knowledgeable citizens" and believe we now have a largely unqualified and unaccountable judiciary making me yearn for the pennsylvania system yet maybe we need an "independent commission of knowledgeable citizens" to appoint the "independent commission of knowledgeable citizens" to select the judges if it would help matters any i would volunteer to be the person to select these knowledgeable citizens id probably start with the phone book john m cogswell buena vista colo not a single federal judge has ever been elected by voters yet our federal judiciary is widely regarded as head and shoulders above its state counterparts i say this as one who has done my share of criticizing certain federal jurists the entire ninth circuit comes to mind as well as justice oconnor for insisting that roe v wade should not be overturned because people rely on it i am well aware that most people in this country believe they have a right to elect judges i and many others disagree retention votes make some sense but only if no more than one judge is on the ballot at a time dick hester newark n j voter education is the function of the electorate not the government no democratic government should ever presume to tell its electorate what "criteria" are proper for voting or what facts are "accurate" or what views are "unbiased " putting such power into the hands of state governments would effectively kill free elections of judges and encourage the application of these undemocratic principles to all elections this is the kind of "education" that one expects in an authoritarian society such as iran or russia it has no place in america william e beringer atlanta former supreme court justice sandra day oconnor claims that an influx of special interest money in state judicial races threatens the integrity of judicial selection but justice oconnor is confusing the symptom with the disease in recent times judges at all levels have shown an alarming propensity to legislate from the bench many of todays judicial decisions intrude into business social and regulatory questions that were traditionally considered the domain of elected legislators with judges routinely overstepping their bounds voters have every right to hold judicial candidates responsible for activist decisions several states have already adopted variations of the merit selection system she favors but instead of promoting nonpartisanship this system generally gives trial lawyers and other legal elites the upper hand in deciding who sits on the bench in missouri three members of the states seven member appellate judicial commission are practicing trial lawyers and the fourth is a member of the missouri association of trial lawyers in tennessee out of members of the judicial selection commission are lawyers half trial lawyers in kansas five out of nine commission members are hand picked by the state bar i fail to see how putting the trial bar in charge of the judicial selection process guarantees an impartial judiciary while allowing voters to get involved violates some sacred principle of judicial independence dan pero former member of the michigan
