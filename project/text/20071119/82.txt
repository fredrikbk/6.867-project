women to watch a special report editors note one of the most gratifying aspects of our women to watch report comes after it runs when the readers have their say on one end there are always a few people who are angry that we do the report at all and feel its sexist to single out women when they ask are we writing about men to watch the short answer just about every day others try to read between the lines looking for clues as to why these particular women rose to the top did they have children husbands who didnt work line jobs one woman wrote that by her count nine of the women last year had blue eyes and two had green leading her to speculate that brown eyes might be the key but most people who write in do so because they are inspired they talk of the obstacles they face every day at work and they marvel at how these women have managed to overcome them they say these stories give them hope that their own paths arent as blocked as they sometimes fear and they say they will pass along the report to others who might be similarly inspired their bosses their colleagues their friends and especially their daughters
