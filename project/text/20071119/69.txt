small business link telemarketer bucks high turnover trend communication promotions and financial perks help employees stay loyal mark wilson says he wants everyone who works for him to feel "like its the best job theyve ever had " thats an ambitious goal for any employer but his company ryla teleservices inc faces the added challenge of being in an industry known for high employee turnover almost all of the telemarketing services firms full time employees earn an hourly wage and the work the president and chief executive admits is often "repetitive and monotonous " even so turnover at ryla was last year and is consistently under compared with an average of for similar call centers in the u s in according to the american teleservices association a trade group based in indianapolis mr wilson credits an emphasis on training as well as efforts to foster a caring environment a sharp contrast to other call centers where employees are often treated as commodities he says retention can be a big challenge for many small companies which lack the room that larger employers have for restless employees to move around says jim kochanski senior vice president at human resources consulting firm sibson consulting in raleigh n c a division of segal group inc but some small companies like ryla can take advantage of their size by building up communication between employees and an accessible management team and establishing an environment where people can advance creating loyalty is often about "making sure everyones connected with the mission of the business " mr kochanski says mr wilson who had run a call center for a big company started ryla five years ago determined to provide quality jobs and culture where workers would want to stay his approach is marked by openness which includes keeping workers in the loop on the companys business wins and hiring plans he maintains an open door policy so employees can stop by his office and make suggestions on how to run the company better "the industry has a bad stereotype of sweatshops and high turnover " he says "were proving you can overcome that if you take a creative approach " but soon after founding the company mr wilson learned that rylas style was an adjustment for many employees accustomed to regimented workplaces for instance after a new employee training session the trainer overheard a trainee complain about having to work the day after thanksgiving and told mr wilson frustrated that employees didnt raise the issue directly mr wilson headed to the training room "i went back in and said does anybody have a problem with the holiday schedule " he recalls after a moment of silence a woman said that she had never been required to work the day after thanksgiving on the spot mr wilson declared it a holiday "i had to prove to them that an open door policy can make an impact " he says but mr wilson admits that with so many more employees and clients that quick decision would be a harder one to make now in an industry often characterized by dead end jobs mr wilson also prides himself on promoting from within eighty percent of managers once worked the front line phone banks he says the firm offers regular professional and personal development seminars on subjects such as financial planning and dressing for success mr wilson estimates that he spends as much as &# each year on retention including a full time associate for employee development who collects employee feedback and manages employee seminars and training programs that spending though is less than it would cost to train a slew of new employees each year he says the company also sponsors charity events another way employees are engaged to work together toward a goal the average ryla employee earns &# an hour and has health benefits though these were trimmed three years ago as costs rose the company now covers of employee health insurance premiums compared with when the company was founded mr wilson says "it was tough for us to swallow " he says but the cost of full coverage "was too burdensome to continue " mr wilson adds that employees understood that costs were rising and no one left as a result when it comes to pay ryla offers an unusual perk for a workplace where most workers are paid hourly people who stay on for three years and meet attendance and performance goals may be given stock options the companys vice president of finance sits down with eligible employees and talks them through the process mr wilson estimates that hourly workers and managers own equity other cultural initiatives are less tangible some are simple like encouraging supervisors to say hello to every member of their team every day about once a quarter ryla will celebrate spirit day where employees might for instance be treated to a picnic these celebrations often feature "cheer offs " a competition where groups of employees write and perform chants to keep spirits high the company marked its five year anniversary on a recent spirit day employees divided into teams corresponding to the clients they represent each team wrote and performed a cheer for the anniversary winners were awarded &# to give to a charity of their choice past prizes have been free lunches or extra vacation days denise burdick who cold calls businesspeople for a ryla client says that given the industrys reputation for wearisome and thankless work she "never would have thought id end up in telemarketing " nevertheless she has been at ryla for five years what keeps her around ms burdick says are extras like stock options the community service activities and the chance to work on a variety of projects some rewards are unexpected like a recent &# monthly performance bonus still some employees arent a fit for an environment chock full of "happy corny stuff " mr wilson says employees who "just want to go to work every day" arent going to last
