politics &amp economics immigration is the question how hopefuls answer could take them far perhaps chariton iowa barack obama had just ended his stump speech before a friendly audience in this tiny southern iowa town when stephen scotts hand shot up with a question would mr obama as president have signed last summers failed "amnesty bill" for illegal immigrants mr scott a local landscape painter asked testily mr obama cautiously walked through a long answer that ended with a plan to give legal status to long established illegal immigrants "there another question " he said shutting down discussion the debate over how to deal with illegal immigrants split the republican party two years ago infuriating its social conservative base and driving away hispanic voters it could be even more perilous for democrats democratic strategists believe that hispanic voters could swing a decisive handful of states including florida arizona new mexico colorado and nevada to the democrats in ensuring the election of a democratic president and cementing a democratic majority for years to come but the partys blue collar middle income and african american supporters are increasingly angry about illegal immigration much of it hispanic democrats "are pretty jumpy on the issue " says rep luis gutierrez an illinois democrat who pushed for immigration overhaul in the house "they would prefer to allow the republicans to shepherd the hispanic votes into the democratic column without having to scare away a single other voter themselves " he says "thats not likely to happen "this election could turn on this issue if we dont handle it intelligently " says connecticut sen christopher dodd a democratic presidential candidate after a recent iowa city foreign policy speech four of the questions passed up to him from the audience were about immigration in a nov wall street journal nbc news poll of adults and of democratic voters said illegal immigration is their top priority but members of that minority organized on the internet have created political turmoil by flooding lawmakers offices with faxes and regularly raising the issue on the campaign trail similarly a november university of iowa poll shows just of iowa democrats consider immigration as the issue "most important" to determining their vote but said a candidates position on immigration is important or very important to them in one sign of the tension within the democratic caucus hispanic american lawmakers were furious last week that democratic leaders hadnt derailed republican efforts to include a limited english only measure in a budget bill hispanics made up of the national vote in but their growing numbers and anger with the republicans over such talk could mean electoral gold for the democrats ndn a nonprofit democratic think tank predicts "there is no reasonable republican road map to victory in " if growing hispanic populations tip several key states into the democratic column but a pro immigration policy risks alienating other democratic constituencies rep gutierrez blames the weakening u s economy for fanning immigration anger among working class voters "its easy because people are afraid" about wages mortgages and jobs he says even here in chariton where the census bureau reports there are only foreign born residents the obama audience worried that mexican workers would displace americans "joe blow citizen knows whats going on " a middle aged man told mr obama schools crowded with spanish speaking children and the lawlessness of illegal immigration seem to anger campaign audiences almost as much "a heck of a lot of middle class democrats feel theyre being overwhelmed by illegal immigrants and theyre reacting the same as republicans only theyre more ashamed to say so " says university of virginia political scientist james ceaser democrats also risk setting off a "rivalry between the minorities" if they tilt toward hispanics with their immigration policy says the university of virginias mr ceaser the rise of hispanic political power has come largely at the expense of african americans and hispanic immigrants have largely replaced blacks in some industries including construction miami urban league president t willard fair among the few black leaders who speak openly about the effects of illegal immigration on african americans says "there is an undercurrent" of resentment in his community blacks arent likely to leave the democratic party over it he says and theyre reluctant to publicly oppose immigration because of their own civil rights history but "all you have to do is take a walk to the neighborhood bar to hear the talk " he says the democrats problem is that they raised immigration to a national issue by promoting an overhaul plan then while it was left bubbling they failed to pass a bill despite having a majority in congress says democratic strategist peter brodnitz who isnt affiliated with a presidential candidate democrats further angered many voters by proposing some benefits for illegal immigrants before producing any economic relief for worried middle class voters adds mr brodnitz polls regularly show a majority of americans resigned to legalizing immigrants if the process includes penalties and is balanced by improved border and workplace enforcement but polls also show that americans are outraged about government benefits for illegal immigrants which makes framing a campaign message tricky for the democrats in a new quinnipiac university poll of voters in ohio a toss up state favored legalizing unlawful immigrants but only said they should be allowed a drivers license and just said their children should be allowed to attend public school republicans meanwhile see illegal immigration as a campaign bonanza because it motivates their base voters while diverting attention from the iraq war and sowing discord among the democrats in the wall street journal nbc poll of republicans said illegal immigration is their first or second priority that has turned immigration from a one time fringe issue into mainstream politics former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney who while they were in office advocated plans to help legalize unlawful immigrants now pound away at plans to deny them jobs and benefits and republicans see value in linking illegal immigration to terrorism and national security two issues where polls show they have an edge over democrats in a new campaign ad rep tom tancredo a colorado republican who is running for president as an immigration opponent warns that u s "open borders" policies invite another terrorist attack
