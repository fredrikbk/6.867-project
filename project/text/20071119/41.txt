oklahomas most wanted a veteran political activist is facing years in prison and a hefty fine for attempting to petition government for redress of grievances the latest news from pakistan no this is happening in oklahoma last month paul jacob the former head of u s term limits and current head of citizens in charge was led out of an oklahoma city courtroom in handcuffs after pleading not guilty to charges that he conspired to defraud the state oklahoma attorney general drew edmondson whos overseeing this bizarre prosecution has accused mr jacob and two fellow petition organizers rick carpenter of oklahomans in action and susan johnson of national voter outreach of bringing out of state petition gatherers to oklahoma to collect signatures in mr carpenter a tulsan launched a signature campaign to get a state wide vote on a taxpayer bill of rights tabor as it is known would cap the rate at which state government spending could increase mr jacob and ms johnson were later brought on board to assist the effort not surprisingly politicians and interest groups that favor big government have developed an intense dislike for tabor spending limits even though like lawmaker term limits they tend to be popular with voters this certainly proved to be the case in oklahoma despite strong opposition from organized labor especially tabor petition advocates managed to gather some signatures from registered voters far more than the needed to get the measure on the state ballot following a court challenge however the signatures were invalidated not because the signers werent legitimate but because the oklahoma supreme court determined that nonresidents of the state had collected signatures ironically it is perfectly legal for opponents of a petition to solicit money and manpower from out of state and sure enough public sector unions opposed to the tabor initiative recruited people from outfits like the oregon based voter education project an offshoot of the afl cio that specializes in countering signature drives they also set up web sites that advertised the location of signature gathers and urged their members to harass them after the oklahoma supreme court ruled attorney general edmondson could have let the matter die instead he decided that the best use of scarce prosecutorial resources was to indict the petition campaigners theres reason to believe his decision has less to do with enforcing the law and more to do with warning activists to think twice before challenging political elites mr jacob says petition organizers consulted with both the board of elections and the secretary of states office and were told that the residency rule could be met by anyone who moved to the state and declared himself a resident in any case that residency requirement is currently being challenged in the th circuit court of appeals and mr edmondson might have at least waited for that outcome before pursuing felony counts against three people acting in good faith "the response is draconian and intended to scare and intimidate " says mr jacob who also faces a fine of up to &# if convicted "to get years in prison for following what you understand to be the rules of the petition drive would send a chilling message not only throughout oklahoma but throughout the country thats not what we want people to be thinking about when they consider whether to join a campaign to reform their government " the democratic ag has denied that his actions are politically motivated telling reporters that "were charged with enforcing the laws that are on the books " but every prosecutor has to make judgment calls about how to deploy limited manpower and in other areas mr edmondson has opted not to act while legal challenges are pending upon learning that the supreme court had agreed to review a challenge to the death penalty for example he recently requested that all executions be halted until the high court speaks like many other ambitious ags mr edmondson has his eye on higher office and indicting tabor supporters will win him friends among the unions and liberal interest groups that can sway a fight for the democratic nomination with so many other real crimes to deter his pursuit of citizen petitioners is not the kind of prosecutorial zeal we need see related letter "letters to the editor oklahoma prosecution is more than ok" wsj nov see related letter "letters to the editor prosecutions criticized" wsj dec
