in france regulator faces a test tough ruling issued in takeover battle may be dropped paris a protracted takeover battle involving a spanish construction company and its french rival is testing the resolve of frances stock market authority and could prove a landmark case for foreign investment and deal making here in years to come five months ago frances markets watchdog the autorite des marches financiers or amf slapped sanctions on spanish construction company sacyr vallehermoso sa for allegedly illegal conduct as it built up a controlling stake in french builder eiffage sa a company whose roots lie in the construction of the eiffel tower in the amf said sacyr had acted in concert with a group of spanish shareholders to take control of eiffage without launching a full takeover bid french law says that if a company owns or more of a french firm it needs to launch a full takeover bid for that company for sacyr which builds bridges luxury resorts apartments malls and highways investing in eiffage was a big part of its strategy to diversify from the spanish real estate sector which had been booming and is now slumping the amf stepped into the battle in april when the spanish company which owns of eiffage filed a prospectus for an all stock bid for the company the french regulator said sacyr was acting in concert with entities that owned up to of eiffage effectively putting it well above the one third threshold the amf ordered sacyr to launch a full cash bid for eiffage at a much higher price than what sacyr had had originally paid when it started buying shares in the french company last year some estimates put the per share price at euros &# or the equivalent of the highest per share price paid by a member of its alleged shareholder group sacyr immediately appealed the ruling saying it had complied with market rules the appeal is still in court the sanction was one of the toughest imposed by a european regulator and it reflected a desire by stock market watchdogs across the continent to crack down on insider trading share price manipulation and other stock market irregularities to enforce their main mission of protecting investments in france however sacyr may now be outmaneuvering the amf last week sacyr said it would be ready to unload its stake in eiffage rather than spend years fighting the amfs ruling in court by putting its eiffage stake on the block sacyr hopes to negate amfs initial ruling a person close to the spanish company said "no more eiffage shares means theres no more issue " the person said that leaves the amf considering its next step a stake sale by sacyr wouldnt necessarily be the end of court proceedings as the underlying legal questions would still exist however according to people familiar with the situation the amf is considering backing down on its initial ruling if sacyr manages to sell down its stake in eiffage as a way to get out of lengthy legal proceedings that would be good news for sacyr which with billion euros in debt would be hard pressed to find the billion euros needed to comply with the amfs ruling to launch a full cash takeover for the roughly of the french company it doesnt already own softening or dropping the initial sanctions however could wreck the amfs credibility with investors just as it had started to show its muscle say analysts and lawyers who arent involved in the case and eiffage shareholders who have lobbied for sanctions against sacyr said the amf would create a dangerous precedent if it watered down its initial ruling against sacyr jerome batteau in paris keith johnson in madrid and gabriel kahn in rome contributed to this article
