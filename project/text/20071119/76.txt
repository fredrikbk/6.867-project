others move to trim their tax bills tyco international ltd shifted its legal home to bermuda a tax haven after a merger with adt ltd industrial equipment maker ingersoll rand co in reincorporated in bermuda such moves provoked an uproar among american politicians prompting a law that makes it harder for american firms to move abroad for tax reasons technically of course every company has a home where it was legally formed that legal home is the starting point in determining the corporate laws and taxes that apply corporate headquarters where top executives and main corporate offices are based is typically in the same country but it doesnt have to be ingersoll rand for instance says its headquarters is still in new jersey though it is incorporated in bermuda beyond the legalities

or merging with lenders in countries such as poland and germany to keep strong positions in those countries mr beckers says executives felt it important to build a new corporate culture not dominated by any one nation so unicredit regularly moves bankers to different markets tripling during the last two years the number of people working outside their home countries it also jettisoned the italian
