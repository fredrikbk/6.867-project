world bank seeks right balance veto of philippines plan shows continued divide over corruption issues washington although the world banks new president robert zoellick has pledged to make rooting out corruption a priority the institution continues to flail over the issue the banks governing board this month blocked a &# million loan for road building in the philippines because it felt bank staff hadnt fully handled corruption issues in reviewing the loan and hadnt briefed mr zoellick on the proposal investigators had uncovered evidence that china state construction engineering co a state owned company was involved in bid rigging on an associated loan program bank officials said while it isnt a formal requirement that every board recommendation be shown to the president bank officials said that such consultation would have made sense given the turmoil the bank has undergone trying to deal with graft the board rejection represents a slap at the staff and indicates continuing divisions within the bank a september report by former federal reserve chairman paul volcker said that the bank wasnt prepared to respond "promptly and effectively" to findings of corruption the philippine loan is the first major project involving corruption issues to come to the board since mr zoellick became president july according to bank officials the world banks board represents the institutions member nations the banks president is chairman of the board as well as ceo of the institution dealing with corruption has been divisive within the bank for years the previous president paul wolfowitz was known to block or delay loans to poor countries suspected of graft but in doing so he alienated many of the banks staff and board members who complained he was penalizing impoverished nations for the sins of contractors staff protests helped spur mr wolfowitz to resign earlier this year mr zoellick has sought a less confrontational approach looking to get bank investigators to work more closely with bank departments that make loans the softer touch may have created problems the world banks east asia department didnt inform him of its plans to seek board approval of the philippines loan despite unresolved graft issues during a board meeting held in his absence a european representative asked the staff members why they had used an expedited approval procedure "when the president was out of town " said a participant staff member james adams the banks vice president for east asia said in an interview that he wasnt trying to go behind mr zoellicks back rather he said his department had worked closely with fraud investigators added a variety of anticorruption measures to the philippine project and believed the loan was ready for board approval "far from obscuring issues we dealt with them directly " he said mr zoellick declined to comment the episode played out in two meetings around nov while mr zoellick was traveling in south asia he was notified about the rejected philippines loan after the second meeting said a world bank spokesman at that time "he made clear that project wont go back to the board unless and until the questions raised are answered " said the spokesman the world bank road construction project was designed to build asphalt paved routes between cities in the philippines around the bank approved a &# million road construction loan but the project moved slowly amid years of corruption scandals and the governments difficulty in establishing a national road authority china state construction engineering co won a &# million contract under the program in in world bank investigators began to suspect that the company had tried to rig bids with a cartel of construction firms in two other road contracts valued at &# million officials in china state constructions u s subsidiary said friday that they had no information regarding the world bank investigation in beijing china state spokesman huang taiping said "as a large multinational company we always put integrity as the first business principle and have a healthy and positive corporate image we never did any bid rigging we always abide business laws and use the legal way to bid we are very confused by the world bank comment " from to the world bank rejected three successive rounds of bidding involving china state construction because of "strong signs of collusion and excessive pricing " a bank official said china state went on to win about a dozen other road building contracts in the philippines by as part of a consortium with several other chinese firms according to philippine government reports the world banks antifraud unit has long been at loggerheads with departments that make loans but in the philippine road construction case said a spokesman for the fraud unit investigators worked closely with the east asia department on the investigation of china state constructions contracts and in designing new anticorruption measures including a citizen watchdog group called "road watch " to monitor future projects around the bank was putting together a second phase of the road project which was to be partly financed by a &# million world bank loan although corruption concerns hadnt eased "corruption is a major issue in the road construction sector ranking as one of the worst in the country " said a world bank analysis of the second phase project the fraud unit had completed its investigation of the contracts and concluded that china state was involved in bid rigging by the time the east asia department asked the board to approve the second phase financing at the end of october the member board refused to authorize the project arguing that the corruption issues in the first phase of the project hadnt been resolved and that mr zoellick hadnt been apprised of the loan request representatives of the u s and canada took the lead in raising the objections said world bank officials mr adams the east asia department chief said the department will seek an analysis by officials from outside his department into how his unit handled the loan issue fraud unit officials were dispatched to manila to brief philippine officials of the completed investigation and gauge their response the boards decision is likely to be an embarrassment to philippines president gloria macapagal arroyo who has pushed for the project and who has been under fire over alleged government corruption since the world bank has barred firms and individuals from doing business with the bank either permanently or for a period of time james hookway in bangkok thailand and james t areddy in shanghai contributed to this article
