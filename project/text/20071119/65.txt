the afternoon report hot off the press online edition amazon com is hoping its kindle will ignite demand for e books and other reading material online an area that has stayed stubbornly analog in a world of blackberries and ipods in new york internet retailer amazon unveiled on monday its long awaited ebook reader called kindle which allows users to download books newspapers and magazines and read them with the help of a battery efficient "electronic paper" interface the device weighs ounces costs &# and holds roughly the equivalent of books in its memory it includes access to a wireless network on which shoppers are able to directly buy so called kindle editions of best sellers and new editions for &# instead of having to use a personal computer to buy the content as one must do with an ipod subscriptions to newspapers and magazines cost extra "weve been working on kindle for more than three years our top design objective was for kindle to disappear in your hands to get out of the way so you can enjoy your reading " said ceo jeff bezos in a press release with kindle amazon has thrown itself into an arena that that so far has drawn relatively few consumers the most notable other offering in the category is the sony reader whose reception has been less than riotous amazon is betting it can buck that trend by pairing up a blackberry style wireless hookup with moderately priced materials in effect doing for e books what apples ipod did for mps e book devices have long been envisioned as the natural next step for the book business but several snags have kept them from catching on with consumers first off as you might expect readability has been a big issue with back lit lcd style displays proving too hard on the eyes for long reading sessions also lcd screens significantly suck away battery life with prolonged use said rob enderle principal analyst with technology firm the enderle group in san jose calif those issues are important he said but the key for the kindle will be offering the content readers want "at the end of the day it is content that is either going to make or break this thing " he said that position makes mr enderle less concerned with what some see as the kindles clunky looking design at techcrunch a technology blog michael arrington wrote that "the kindle isnt the most elegant looking gadget ever created in fact it looks like it came out of the s but it packs an impressive list of features and could finally bring e books mainstream thats something sony couldnt accomplish with its much more elegant sony reader " mr enderle agrees that the kindles design might not make gadgeteers coo lovingly and suggests that subsequent versions will feature fewer buttons which consumers can find daunting and while he isnt exactly thrilled that the device is white a color on which smudges and fingerprints easily appear he notes "the first ipods were white too " stocks drop on citigroup downgrade a downgrade of citigroup shares
