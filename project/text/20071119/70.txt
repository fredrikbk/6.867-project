worthless piece of paper" that doesnt deserve to be the currency most often used for oil trading as the bbc notes those comments only added to now familiar doubts about the dollar amid worries in the persian gulf over the value of dollar denominated holdings there is it any wonder the ruble is becoming a petro currency of choice in central asia opecs reluctance to increase supply right now almost seemed lost amid what the wall street journal calls the "myriad anxieties" bubbling up during the summit that reluctance itself comes in the face of an idea gaining credence among leaders in the oil industry that "the world is approaching a practical limit to the number of barrels of crude oil that can be pumped every day " the journal reports and that limit would be well short of global demand projected for the coming decades what such projections assume of course is that the worlds leaders and industry will withstand pressure to somehow move global commerce away from carbon based fuel amid the dire warnings and scientific consensus about climate change the nobel winning intergovernmental panel on climate change released its final report over the weekend concluding among other worrisome effects that the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere so far will cause average sea levels to rise up to feet and the reports own authors admit that its warnings "may well underplay the problem of climate change " the international herald tribune says even opec keenly aware of the many sources of tension related to oil itself pledged to spend &# million for research into technology

downturn to the commercial real estate sector moodys investors service plans to say today the wall street journal reports the moodys study of the sector which nearly doubled in value over the past seven years will show a month to month decline in property values for september the journal says "the report is an early sign that the commercial property sector is being dragged down by the growing reluctance of lenders to extend credit for anything related to real estate which in turn could create a new drag on the economy and additional problems for investors " the journal adds "declining commercial property values could lead to an increase in default rates on commercial real estate loans and on commercial mortgage backed securities " and its not just the u s the times of london citing a survey taken by mwb business exchange a company with serviced office buildings in the city west end and canary wharf parts of london reports that the british capitals multi billion pound "offices market is set for further price falls as evidence emerges that big banks have put their requirements for large new lettings on hold for up to a year and are opting for short term flexible leases " the goldman exception goldman sachs chief executive lloyd blankfein this year will almost certainly earn more than the &# million he made in the new york times reports and "if he gets a raise in line with the growth of goldmans compensation pool he will take home at least &# million some expect his pay which is directly tied to the firms performance to climb as high as &# million " the times says the reason his career is going in the opposite direction of chuck princes or stan oneals is that goldman unlike almost all its peers on wall street decided late last year to cut its exposure against "mortgage risk" and even take out expensive insurance against the risk that remained the times adds another exception to wall streets widespread malaise is a little known mutual fund called amana income fund which the wall street journal notes can thank islamic law for being one of the top performers of the year since amana is a fund whose investments are based on islamic religious principles meaning it must shun investing its money in banks or other firms that earn by charging interest as well as in companies that carry lots of debt it has been able to make a return since the start of the year in contrast with the wider market and those results are mirrored by the dow jones islamic fund which is up this year the journal adds also of note bbc rescue and relief teams are thought to have

military proposal outlines an intensified effort to enlist tribal leaders in the frontier areas of pakistan in the fight against al qaeda and the taliban as part of a broader effort to bolster pakistani forces against an expanding militancy american military officials said the proposal is modeled in part on a similar effort by american forces in anbar province in iraq that has been hailed as a great success in fighting foreign insurgents there but it raises the question of whether such partnerships to be forged in this case by pakistani troops backed by the u s can be made without a significant american military presence in pakistan and it is unclear whether enough support can be found among the tribes some of which are working with pakistans intelligence agencies wall street
