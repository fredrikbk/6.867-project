love &amp money emotion vs logic and the winner is when it comes to money logic doesnt necessarily make the most sense i was thinking about this recently when for tax reasons i decided to put some money into an account in my name only but when i told my wife amy about it she didnt mince words "i dont like this idea " she said "this will be your money but its coming out of our account " logic vs emotion we all struggle with it in our finances you know for instance that you shouldnt put all your money into your companys stock but you like the idea of supporting your employer or you know that a particular extended warranty makes no financial sense but buying it will let you sleep better at night but if logic and emotion do battle inside all of us how do you manage that conflict in a marriage you cant just sweep the emotions aside and say logic prevails such an approach is certain to fuel a fight or build animosity that will explode later plus its demeaning to essentially say your partners feelings dont matter at the same time though you cant just acquiesce to every idiosyncrasy because that could lead to stupid financial decisions that will hurt the familys pocketbook in short how do you account for feelings when managing the familys money let me be clear about one thing this is not a gender issue men are caught up in the emotional aspects of money just as often as women in my own marriage amy and i have both taken illogical positions plenty of times this latest debate began when i was talking to my accountant about ways to reduce our taxes she suggested sticking some of the advance money i recently received for a book into an ira for self employed workers a so called sep ira since im writing this book outside of my day job that would save us a few thousand dollars in taxes as well as fatten our nest egg when i told amy of my plan to pull money from our savings account where i had deposited the book advance to fund the ira she balked she understood the tax benefits but couldnt move past the idea that money in our savings account would be placed beyond her jurisdiction "i need to feel were coasting at the same speed " she told me "if wed gotten married later in life id understand that our retirement accounts might be different but we started at the same place and your accounts are already so much heavier than mine and that bothers me now your pie is getting even bigger " what amy was referring to is something ive written about before because she has followed my career until recently she hasnt been able to accumulate a retirement account the size of mine the upshot she said "is that i dont feel equal i want the scales to be more balanced " logically this is a nonissue regardless of amys worries the dollars going into my ira are still "our" dollars we live in a community property state if we were to get divorced half of my sep ira would go with her and assuming we stay together whatever my accounts generate in retirement will be used to pay our joint expenses still as ive said in this column many times discussions about money are rarely about money often theyre about power and control jealousy and resentment looking at it from that perspective i understand amys consternation she wants to feel both financially independent and that shes benefiting from our life together as much as i am i can see that if i deposited a large check into my account it would make her squeamish even though its the familys best move financially "im not going to be stupid and say dont fund your ira because that means we take an unnecessary tax hit " she told me "but i want to create some equality i want my own account " amy has both a roth and traditional ira but part of our problem is that for various reasons she cant stash additional cash in those accounts as i can in this sep ira nor does she have the time to generate free lance income that would open up other options but we do have a solution amy is going to open a nondeductible ira into which she can contribute we wont get a tax deduction for her efforts and well have added paperwork come tax time but she gets tax deferred growth in her account and gains a sense of equality and while we dont have the financial wherewithal to dump a large sum into this account well fund it gradually that means weve agreed that part of any additional free lance income i earn will be earmarked for her account and in years when i dont generate free lance income well divert part of our income to add to her stash financially speaking this exercise is largely irrelevant its all the same pot of cash in retirement the tax impact of doing this isnt great yet from an emotional standpoint it re establishes familial harmony and thats a huge benefit because although you cant always change the way someone feels about money you can acknowledge the concern and find a solution that tempers the worry update were back from disney world and our year old daughter fared far better than imagined in a previous column i mentioned my concerns about the wisdom of taking such a young child to disney in a separate column i wrote about amy being unhappy that i booked a nondirect flight to save money the possibility of missing connections and extending the trip with a layover was her idea of a bad way to start a vacation well im happy to report that our little one surprised us she managed the plane rides well enjoyed lunch during the layover and made not a peep on any flight at the park itself she did better than her year old brother who i figured was the perfect age for disney he certainly loved the park but spent his energy trying to drag us into every gift shop the rides to him seemed like distractions between souvenir stands our daughter on the other hand loved the kid size roller coaster survived pirates of the caribbean and was livid when she wasnt tall enough to board the new everest roller coaster and only once did she fall asleep in the park jeff opdyke covers personal
