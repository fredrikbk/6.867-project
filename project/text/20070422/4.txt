getting going good advice people prefer to ignore there are some arguments ill never win after penning more than getting going columns i have a pretty good idea of which topics will spark dissenting emails from readers in response ill often fine tune my arguments in later columns hoping to overcome readers objections but there are unfortunately certain subjects that prompt deep unease among readers and these folks wont change their minds no matter how wonderful my arguments here are five such topics if you hold a year bond with good call protection to maturity you know how much interest you will receive and how much you will get back when the bond matures by contrast if you own a bond mutual fund for years you cant be sure what you will earn this uncertainty leads many to conclude that individual bonds are safer but that isnt the case if you sell an individual bond before maturity you could receive far less than the price you paid more important your money is riding on a single security if youre dealing with corporate bonds theres a real risk of default a bond fund reduces this default risk through broad diversification you also benefit from the funds buying power you can automatically reinvest your dividends and you can make purchases with relatively small sums but many investors ignore these advantages and instead fret that when they sell their fund shares could be worth a few pennies less than the price they paid the fretting doesnt stop there as i have argued many times the goal when building a portfolio is to combine a slew of risky and conservative investments and then focus on the entire portfolios performance that performance should be surprisingly sedate as short term losses on some investments are offset by gains elsewhere yet this advice doesnt work for many investors if their emerging markets fund is in the doghouse they will worry endlessly even though the fund might account for a mere of their money and even though their overall portfolio is faring just fine indeed this sort of investor behavior has prompted mutual fund companies to introduce lifecycle funds which offer a globally diversified portfolio in a single mutual fund these funds own all kinds of volatile investments but all shareholders see is a single relatively calm share price find investing unnerving consider using a lifecycle fund such as one of the t rowe price retirement funds or the vanguard target retirement funds as your core holding for some however this advice also doesnt work the idea of sticking a heap of money in a single fund makes them uneasy they feel more comfortable owning multiple funds even if the funds offer essentially the same market exposure this mindset also applies to fund companies and brokerage firms i often argue that investors should simplify their financial lives by sticking with a single brokerage firm or mutual fund company after all the key to reducing risk is spreading your money across a host of stock and bond market sectors you can easily do that by opening an account at a reputable brokerage firm and buying exchange traded index funds or alternatively spreading your money across a variety of funds from a major mutual fund company but for many readers having all their money at one institution is just too scary there may indeed be some miniscule risk that if you keep all your money at one firm your lifes savings could disappear in an astonishing fraud or a massive computer meltdown but if you use a reputable firm the risk strikes me as extraordinarily small and certainly not enough to justify the hassle of maintaining accounts at multiple brokerage firms and mutual fund companies for years i have touted the virtues of immediate fixed annuities that pay lifetime income with these annuities you hand over a wad of money to an insurer and in return receive a check every month for life i think this is a great way for retirees to squeeze more spending money out of their savings while also locking up an income stream they cant outlive dont have a traditional pension plan upon retirement you might sink of your savings into an immediate annuity i am hardly the only person pushing these annuities both academics and washington policy wonks think immediate annuities could ease the financial headaches facing retiring baby boomers but ordinary americans arent interested according to insurance researchers limra international in windsor conn immediate fixed annuity sales were a mere &# billion in why so little buying an annuity smacks of "dipping into principal " a big no no for many investors retirees also hate the idea that they will buy the annuity and die soon after having received scant income in return for their hefty upfront investment worries about an early death also drive half of all seniors to claim social security at the earliest possible age at first blush this seems like a reasonable decision social security is designed to be "actuarially equivalent " meaning that if you have a normal life expectancy you should do equally well no matter when you claim still there are two key reasons to consider delaying social security until your mid s and possibly until age thereby getting a large monthly check first if you were the familys breadwinner your spouse may receive your benefit as a survivor benefit and thus the life expectancy of your benefit could be far longer than your life expectancy alone second social security isnt just an income stream it is also insurance you will get that government check every month no matter how long you live by delaying you buy yourself more insurance which could pay off handsomely if you live a surprisingly long life but most seniors arent biting they spent their entire career paying into social security and theyre anxious to start getting their money back jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at jonathan
