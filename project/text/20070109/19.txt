foot long smart fortwo as the company prepares to roll out the money losing smart in american showrooms next year the question is will people in the land of hulking suvs feel safe buying a car thats only about half the size of a honda accord the subcompact segment has been one of the fastest growing vehicle categories as gasoline prices have risen over the past two years last year sales of entry level subcompact vehicles grew by almost in compared with with new entries like the toyota yaris honda fit and nissan versa and redesigned versions of the chevrolet aveo and hyundai accent these vehicles are about four feet longer than the fortwo which had its u s debut this week at the north american international auto show here the fortwo is seen widely in europe but the tiny size raises safety concerns on this side of the atlantic because of the size of typical american vehicles like foot long chevrolet tahoe the countrys top selling full size suv in a recent study by the insurance institute for highway safety only the nissan versa got ratings of "good" for front side and rear crashes out of all the subcompact cars the honda fit and the toyota yaris got good ratings for only

when they collide with bigger heavier vehicles " said adrian lund the institutes president united auto group inc the second largest auto dealer chain and the sole distributor of the smart vehicles in the u s knows it will be a challenge to show americans that the baby size car will be safe thats why this spring smart will hit the road with three teams fanning out to cities smart will emphasize the tridion safety cell made of reinforced steel that is the frame for the car a skeleton of the vehicle showing off the safety cell and the four air bags will be on display during the roadshow and a video showing a mercedes e class sedan crashing into a smart will be played for customers the video shows that while the front end of the smart is crumpled the interior remains undamaged with

information on cars sold on the continent "we consider safety to be our wow factor " said anthony pordon senior vice president at the united auto group affodability will also play a large role in the marketing campaign the smart which will start at around &# is expected to get over miles per gallon of gas dave schembri president of smart usa said besides the rational messages of safety fuel economy and affordability the marketing campaign will also show that the smart is fun to drive and easy to park mr pordon added that the average household now has more than two cars and the smart would be an ideal third vehicle target customers for the smart will be urban residents baby boomers teenagers and those in retirement the brand is hoping to emulate the success of bmw ags mini cooper the mini which is slightly more than three feet longer than the smart has seen sales growth since it was launched in the u s in although sales fell in by smart is hoping that a successful launch in the u s will give the brand the sales volumes it needs to ensure a long term future following years of losses in its home base of europe making the smart car business profitable has been one of the top priorities for daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche since he succeeded jurgen schrempp a year ago the unit has been unprofitable every year since its first model in and efforts to expand its model lineup to more conventional vehicle categories have bombed last year the company eliminated a four seat smart model after just two years on sale efforts to turn around smart in the past few years have saddled daimlerchrysler with billions of dollars in restructuring charges smart which is run by the companys mercedes division was a main reason for mercedess loss of million euros about &# million in the luxury car divisions first annual loss in more than a decade daimlerchrysler doesnt disclose smarts financial results but company officials have said they expect the brand to come into the black this year as a result of extensive cost cuts the smart will arrive in u s showrooms in early and the most expensive model will be a convertible that is priced around &# in the first phase of the cars launch the vehicle will be carried by dealers in the u s those dealerships will be announced this summer because of its low price it may be difficult for daimlerchrysler to make much money because the car is made in europe the euros strength against the dollar makes european exports to the u s expensive in partnering with united auto group daimlerchrysler is embarking on a very different strategy from the one it used to launch smart in europe there the company set up a separate dealership network for the brand a costly decision intended to help smart create its own identity but which also put pressure on the company to expand smarts model lineup archrival bmw ag used a similar strategy when it encouraged its bmw dealers to add showrooms to existing facilities to carry its mini line "the biggest mistake daimlerchrysler made in setting up smart was to create an entire parallel infrastructure " says stephen cheetham an industry analyst with sanford c bernstein ltd in london "bmw shows the power of an alternative approach "
