how pepsi opened door to diversity a s all black team targeted a new market and broke a barrier the rivalry between pepsi and coke which started in the s is legendary in business less known is that a more important battle was being fought on the front lines of the cola wars at the same time the struggle of african americans to gain access to professional jobs in major corporations walter s mack the astute president of the underdog pepsi cola co decided he could lift the stalled sales of his soft drink by hiring a team of african american marketers to make a more concerted effort to pursue the black consumer dollar how those qualified employees would fit into pepsi colas corporate culture and whether they could ultimately be promoted above their separate and narrow specialty that was the real pepsi challenge at the time pepsi was already popular among members of the black population because it offered as its ads boasted "twice as much" for the standard nickel price of a soft drink ounces compared with the six ounce bottle of most rivals but the full revenue potential of what was then called "the negro market" was largely ignored it wasnt until the end of the decade that white owned manufacturers began paying serious attention to the untapped market in modern industry magazine estimated the spending power of americas million blacks at &# billion an amount equal to that of the entire population of canada the magazine observed mr mack had long believed that being different could sometimes provide an advantage he started pursuing black customers by hiring a three member sales team of african americans in during world war ii sugar rations and economic pressures made it all but impossible to continue that initial effort but after the war ended mr mack decided to court the black consumer with a full department of salesmen with a budget for advertising and promotional tools in he hired edward f boyd a onetime singer and actor working then for the national urban league in new york to create the new division six members of that team now in their s and s lived to tell their story for the book "the real pepsi challenge" mr boyd dr jean emmons of florida allen l mckellar of st louis julian c nicholas of north carolina william r simms of massachusetts and dr charles e wilson of new jersey to their delight they also lived to see indra k nooyi an india born woman appointed chief executive officer of pepsico inc in august not long after the company edged past coca cola co in value of market capitalization both milestones would have been unthinkable in the days when the marketing team was working ms nooyi in her post since oct also marvels at the struggle of some of the companys earliest hires "this inspiring team of african american professionals were far ahead of their time and set the standard for passion determination and connecting with our customers and consumers " she said "they also established the economic value of diversity long before affirmative action was conceived " the mission of the black sales representatives at pepsi cola was to win over loyal new customers first by making personal appearances then by placing ads in the black press and setting up displays at mom and pop stores in black communities the team members had a grueling schedule working seven days a week morning and night for weeks on end they visited bottlers churches "ladies groups " schools college campuses ymcas community centers insurance conventions teacher and doctor conferences and various civic organizations they got famous jazzmen such as duke ellington and lionel hampton to give shout outs for pepsi from the stage no group was too small or too large to target for a promotion these national sales representatives at the teams peak in were celebrities in their communities when they worked for pepsi cola at that time african americans rarely saw a black man working in a suit and tie carrying a corporate business card their activities were covered in the black press in front page articles and in gossip columns "we were living examples of what can happen to you if you go into business " said former salesman julian nicholas the team members were more qualified than their white counterparts all had college degrees and one jean emmons had an m b a from the university of chicago but they were consistently paid less they also were well trained getting additional outside instruction from an expert at the national urban league one of the many black organizations desperate to have the men do well the salesmen did succeed boosting pepsi sales in every area they hit with a marketing blitz "this is what happened in louisville ky increase among accounts called " read one sign posted by mr boyd at a chicago bottlers convention thanks to their help too pepsi was able to overtake coke sales in some rare instances in northern cities such as cleveland and chicago their jobs turned most of the men into pepsi fanatics said team member jean emmons "all of my friends had to buy pepsi i kept stockpiles of pepsi in my house all the places i went had to have pepsi if i was out with someone and they ordered coke i might have thrown a glass of water in their face my wife would say i think youre going crazy pepsi pepsi pepsi " but as much as the men enjoyed their new status their sales trips could also be humiliating and sometimes harrowing lynchings were still part of the american landscape and the men knew they had to be careful they were traveling salesmen in the time of jim crow segregation laws they had to sit in the back of buses ride in separate train compartments and eat behind closed curtains in dining cars mr boyd said one team member alexander l jackson the son of a prominent chicago family found the indignities too much to bear and soon quit "the first time he saw a white bus driver order a black man to sit at the back of the bus he nearly had a stroke " mr boyd said of the late mr jackson who was a harvard graduate the son of a harvard graduate and the brother of a harvard graduate "he just couldnt take it or any of the separate but equal laws of the south " early on mr mack tried to protect his sales force by insisting the black representatives travel in pullman cars so that they could dine and sleep by themselves but even having the black salesmen traveling in the special high priced sleeping cars offended some people "the conductor would come and pull down the shades so the whites couldnt see the blacks " allen mckellar a member of the special markets team recalled the white business leaders who hired black salesmen in the s and s also had to be careful they wanted the black customers dollar but companies seen as pandering to african americans by donating to their communities selling them products and hiring black professionals were often shunned by white consumers even mr mack who seemed sincere in his efforts to forward racial equality mostly confined his boasts about pro black business initiatives and charitable programs to the black press away from the mainstream at one bottlers convention in new york in mr mack went so far as to tell the bottlers "were going to have to give pepsi a little more status a little more class in other words were going to have to develop a way whereby it will no longer be known as a nigger drink " recalled mr russell mr boyd confirmed his recollection a seething mr boyd walked out on his boss from the front row and later received a personal apology from mr mack "i didnt forget it but i didnt hold it against him either " mr boyd said in a statement yesterday a pepsico spokesman said about the incident "its an appalling and completely unacceptable comment with as much sting today as it had years ago hopefully starting with mr macks apology in and nearly six decades of positive actions weve taken since weve shown pepsicos true commitment to diversity " the so called negro marketers helped bolster sales at pepsi cola during its most troubled times but they also helped define the concept and strategy of niche marketing and were instrumental in changing the way african americans were portrayed in advertising instead of stereotypes from aunt jemimas and uncle bens to offensive caricatures of bare bottomed children the pepsi ads that appeared in the black press showed african americans as stylish fun loving middle class consumers living the american dream mr boyd hired some of the first professional black models "i kept saying i wanted to make something impressive " he said he launched three major press campaigns from to for the first he found accomplished african americans to profile for a "leaders in their fields" series about names in all the campaign compared the professionals with pepsi a "leader in its field " it began in april with united nations diplomat ralph bunche that series was complemented in the upstart ebony magazine by a seven ad series drawn by award winning african american cartoonist jay jackson known for his biting satire of racists and red baiters for his third series mr boyd took a crew to the campuses of black universities to photograph top students enjoying pepsi finally mr boyd was ready to tackle the displays in stores selling the soft drink he wanted to make a splash with a colorful point of sale advertising piece showing a black family and thought a friends son would make a perfect model the seven year old was handsome bright and full of energy his real life father william brown was the new manager of a hotel in harlem "ronnie used to run around the theresa hotel in and out of the bar greeting people " said mr boyd with a grin "he was very precocious we were concerned hed come to no good " to everyones surprise when it was the young boys turn to pose for the shoot he was poised cooperative and professional he did his shoot smiling and reaching up for a six pack of pepsi held by his "mother " a popular new model named sylvia fitt the result was a handsome tableau of a middle class african american family enjoying a meal and pepsi the boy was ron brown who grew up to become secretary of commerce in the clinton administration the ad campaigns were a hit thousands of individuals and schools asked for reprints of the leaders series to use as educational tools but the pepsi cola hiring experiment had mixed results in the end one team member who stayed on at pepsi cola the late harvey c russell became a vice president in the company in the first african american ever promoted to that title at a major corporation jackie robinson the baseball star had been made vice president of smaller chock full onuts in a handful of other team members had long and lucrative careers at pepsi cola but most of the team members complained they were never considered for other positions around the company the experiment came to an end after mr mack left the company and was replaced by alfred n steele a former coca cola executive and the future husband of actress joan crawford mr mack died in at the age of mr steele died in just short of his th birthday the new boss was more focused on building up the company and expanding its reach overseas than on workforce diversity and marketing to minorities embracing the decentralization trend in management popular at the time he saw no need for a new york based special sales division in a broad reorganization in mr steele fired mr boyd and had his team members dispersed to offices around the country in those offices the salesmen succeeded only as far as their managers believed in the need for niche marketing to boost profits locally most of the men quit soon after one of the most educated found himself mopping floors for a time but all eventually went on to remarkable second careers ed boyd joined the international aid agency care in the middle east for example charles wilson studied medicine in geneva and became a doctor julian nicholas who stayed long enough to be promoted to national head of special markets left in to work for the state department and the protocol offices of the administrations of president johnson and president carter jean emmons earned a ph d in education and became a career superintendent of schools all the way they continued to break down color barriers to their careers mr boyd proudly takes credit for helping open the door to diversity "it was a contribution to social progress " said mr boyd of his work at pepsi "i didnt make that much of a dollar i wasnt paid on the basis of other executives it was at the beginning "
