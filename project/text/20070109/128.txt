what ge brought to his life the education of ronald reagan by thomas w evans columbia university press pages &# almost everyone now agrees ronald reagans nationally televised speech in on behalf of barry goldwater did a great deal not only for goldwaters candidacy but for reagan himself columnist david broder has called it "the most successful political debut" of the century no less a conservative eminence than william f buckley flatly says that what became known as the speech a rousing call for freedom and free markets "catapulted reagan from hollywood to the white house " but what forces shaped such a seminal address for decades historians have debated exactly how reagan went from a self described "hemophiliac liberal" to americas leading small government conservative in little more than a decade the answer has a lot to do with the years to when reagan worked as the host of cbss top rated "general electric theater" and served as ges spokesman for weeks at a time he would tour ges plants eventually meeting most of the employees in them reagan himself estimated that he spent hours before ge microphones giving talks that started out with hollywood patter but ended up as full throated warnings about big government "ge tours became almost a post graduate course in political science for me " he later wrote "by i had completed the process of self conversion " thomas w evans a lawyer who served in the reagan administration has composed an elegant history of reagans "studies" with general electric much of "the education of ronald reagan" is devoted to rediscovering lemuel boulware reagans mentor at ge and the dynamo behind both the companys pr efforts and its labor negotiation policy boulware believed that at the start of contract talks ge should make an offer it viewed as fair to stockholders workers and customers and then stick with it allowing for almost no changes this "take it or leave it" approach was so successful strikes became almost unknown at ge that it entered the lexicon of labor relations as "boulwarism " but boulware who had served his labor relations apprenticeship as deputy director of the war production board in world war ii also believed that the policy would work only if executives went over the heads of union officials and educated the workers directly about why they had a stake in ges prosperity mr evans notes that "a worker who learned that ges profit margin was much smaller than he had been led to believe or that union officials had not been truthful with him" was unlikely to join a picket line or insist on over the top demands thanks to his outreach to workers and his workers surveys boulware was "reputed to understand blue collar workers better than anyone in the country " boulwares efforts included an elaborate campaign to educate both ges workers and the public on the moral and economic benefits of free enterprise "our free markets and our free persons are at stake " he told the graduating class of the harvard business school in to combat what he saw as creeping collectivism he encouraged workers to form book clubs and to read free market texts from the foundation for economic education e g henry hazlitts "economics in one lesson" and wilhelm ropkes "economics of the free society " he also encouraged his managers to read the wall street journals editorial page and mr buckleys brand new national review mr boulwares free market message so penetrated ges work force that reagan his traveling ambassador quickly saw how important it was for him to become familiar with what the workers were reading over time his own reading and his conversations with ge workers had an effect by the late s reagan was lambasting those "who cant see a fat man standing beside a thin one without automatically concluding the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one " historian rick perstein has concluded that "reagan was an integral component in the boulwarite system " the alliance lasted until when boulware was eased into retirement after his methods came under growing legal attack from unions backed by the new kennedy administration appointees on the national labor relations board the next year when reagans contract came up he received a call from a ge executive who told him that the company wanted him to pitch ge products not economic policy "you can get somebody else " reagan recalled saying "theres no way that i could go out now to an audience that is expecting the type of thing ive been doing for the last eight years and suddenly stand up and start selling them electric toasters " within two days ge canceled the cbs show that reagan had hosted but the lessons reagan had learned during his ge barnstorming stuck with him several passages in the speech of came directly from his ge talks "there is no such thing as a left or right there is only an up or down up to mans age old dream the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism " the influence of those years lasted well into reagans presidency the time magazine journalist hugh sidey recalled admiring some of reagans white house speeches so much that he asked a speechwriter who had written them "reagan " he was told "they were actually pretty much the speeches he had given when he worked for general electric " and for the ge talks reagan was his own speechwriter it was in these forgotten ge years brought to life so vividly by mr evans that reagan developed into "the great communicator" someone not only with an engaging speaking style but with something principled to say a gifted popularizer of liberty had thus found the perfect partner in a business leader who believed in aggressively defending the free market system would that more such business leaders existed today mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com
