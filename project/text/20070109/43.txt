enterprise do start ups really need formal business plans studies find often time wasted gathering data with no link to success business schools and consultants have long preached that writing a formal business plan greatly improves a start ups odds of success but a growing number of academics are questioning whether thats really the case budding entrepreneurs can spend months sometimes years polishing elaborate to page business plans that include financial projections market research and intricate details on day to day planning and organization but skeptics say theres little concrete evidence that extensive planning is highly correlated to success a more practical approach they say for entrepreneurs who arent seeking external start up financing from venture capitalists or angel investors is to write a "back of the envelope" plan with basic financial projections such as cash flow and fine tune the business model after launching the business "what we really dont want to do is literally spend a year or more essentially writing a business plan without knowing we have actual customers " says william bygrave an entrepreneurship professor at babson college in wellesley mass who says he generally advocates "just do it " entrepreneurs must be nimble and will be more apt to stick with a flawed concept they spent months drafting he adds the doubts fly in the face of a huge lucrative business planning industry chock full of authors writing step by step guides and consultants selling business planning services a recent search for "business plan" on amazon com turned up more than book titles business schools also have reason to push planning its much easier to teach than intuition many colleges and universities have ramped up their entrepreneurship programs in recent years and introduced business planning courses many top business schools including the university of pennsylvania wharton school and harvard now host student business plan competitions for cash prizes vinay gupta of ann arbor mich spent six months attending conferences meeting with consultants and writing a page business plan before launching an outsourcing consulting firm for midsize businesses in but after starting the business it became clear far fewer midsize firms sought outsourcing help than his research suggested he scrapped his original idea and developed outsourcing management software geared toward companies with annual revenue of more than &# million while the planning helped him learn about the industry it didnt point out the fundamental flaw of his original idea "we were handed one or two prospects in the planning stage but it was a lot harder going after a broader base of customers after we launched " mr gupta says the critics of formal planning contend that it runs counter to whats at the heart of the entrepreneurial spirit the ability to learn and adapt through experience and theres a growing body of research supporting the notion that formal planning may not make much difference a study recently released by babson college analyzed businesses started by alumni who graduated between and comparing success measures such as annual revenue employee numbers and net income the study found no statistical difference in success between those businesses started with formal written plans and those without them the study concludes that "unless you need to raise external start up capital from institutional sources or business angels you do not need to write a formal business plan " amar bhide a columbia university entrepreneurship professor found that of inc magazines list of the fastest growing private firms didnt have business plans and had only rudimentary plans a follow up by the magazine in found the numbers without a plan have remained pretty much the same many business concepts are "transitional in nature " meaning there are competitive advantages to starting the business quickly and by the time you write a full business plan "the opportunity will be gone " benson honig a professor at wilfrid laurier university in ontario canada says his research of nascent entrepreneurs in sweden from the late s also found no correlation between business planning and profitability instead his study found the biggest predictor of success to be knowing customers in advance mr honig says he teaches "contingency planning" to his students or thinking about a business as constantly progressing changing and making decisions based on the market climate instead of traditional business planning business planning advocates counter that plans while not always perfect can help nascent entrepreneurs nail down important aspects of their concept and sometimes prevent costly mistakes bill evans a counselor for score a group of retired business executives who counsel entrepreneurs says one client wanted to start a business designing custom scrapbooks but it wasnt until she started formally planning that it became clear she would only make &# an hour for her labor scott shane a professor at case western reserve university says most studies that discount business planning are flawed because they dont correct for business failure rates only accounting for businesses that survived if they did they would find that a far greater number of businesses that failed never had a formal business plan mr shanes research which relies on the same sample from sweden as mr honigs study controls for failure rates and shows that businesses with formal plans are more likely to survive he says most business ideas dont have to be rushed to market and that it typically takes a long time for businesses to get started anyway "im not sure that saying oh people shouldnt write business plans would accelerate a lot more people into the start up process " he says "they seem to be held back by a lot of other things " the most compelling reason to write a formal business plan even critics agree is when seeking venture capital or angel investors but only roughly of about four million start ups each year get that money and even then the merits of having a lengthy business plan may be overblown matt coffin founder and chief executive of lowermybills com a web site sold to experian corp in for &# million says he used a page powerpoint presentation that he spent four to six months gathering research for instead of a formal business plan when pitching his idea to investors in he succeeded in raising &# million in venture capital by convincing them that the market for people needing a one stop place on the internet to refinance was ballooning tim petersen managing director of arboretum ventures a health care venture capital firm in ann arbor mich says he generally prefers getting five to page summaries of business ideas or powerpoint presentations over lengthy business plans "ill have to confess its not always crucial to have the page business plan" he says while most entrepreneurs seeking should have their ideas well formulated "some people will get a little caught up in the perfection of their plan " he says even some believers of business planning say formal planning foes have some valid points tom kinnear executive director of the entrepreneurial studies institute at the university of michigan says writing a business plan shouldnt take more than three or four weeks "theres no question that some people are obsessed with writing plans that are too wrought with detail " mr kinnear says "early on all you really need is a compass "
