widening war if iraq worsens allies see nightmare case washington as president bush prepares to unveil his latest iraq strategy arab allies are worried about what might happen if the plan fails that worsening strife could engulf the entire region sparking a wider war in the middle of the worlds largest oil patch the potential of a much larger regional conflict that pits sunnis against shiites is increasingly on the minds of both arab leaders and u s military planners according to regional diplomats and u s officials some are calling such a possible outcome the "nightmare scenario " a wider conflict appears more plausible now because even as iraq is separating along sectarian lines regional dynamics are shoving neighboring nations into two rival camps on one side is a shiite led arc running from iran into central iraq through syria and into lebanon on the other side lie american allies saudi arabia jordan and egypt along with persian gulf states such as qatar and the united arab emirates these sunni regimes are horrified at the emerging increasingly radicalized shiite bloc largely financed and inspired by iran arab diplomats say in the middle is iraq which looks less and less like a buffer between these two axes of middle east power and more of a no mans land that is bringing them into conflict arab officials fear that if the u s withdraws from there or diminishes its troop numbers in ways that iraqs own weak military cant fill the two sides could come into direct and bloody conflict the u s is now eager to tamp down these rising jitters over a wider clash within the arab world mr bush in a televised speech tomorrow night will detail plans for reconstruction aid and a temporary surge in the number of u s troops in iraq the troop boost is meant in part to calm regional fears of a u s pullout mr bush is expected to send secretary of state condoleezza rice to the region soon to help explain his new iraq strategy in what could be her most comprehensive trip there in more than a year the u s is also pushing a wide ranging strategy to persuade its sunni allies that it is serious about counteracting the rise of iran in exchange for arab help in iraq and the palestinian territories key to the effort is the continued promise to keep u s forces in iraq for as long as necessary but the u s is also beefing up u s forces in the persian gulf and plans to deepen security cooperation with gulf allies the pentagon has proposed sending a second carrier battle group to the gulf region there are also advanced plans under way to knit together the air defense systems of the six smaller gulf states including qatar oman and the united arab emirates and to build a u s administered missile defense system similarly the air force is laying plans to step up exercises with arab allies in the region one proposal calls for the u s to hold combined air exercises with oman and the uae arab governments are putting in place their own contingency plans in case iraq begins to fall apart the saudis have warned the bush administration that they are prepared to aid the sunni militias in iraq if the sunni population there becomes imperiled a saudi diplomat said jordanian officials have told the pentagon that they may move troops into iraqs uninhabited western desert as a buffer if events there spiral out of control according to u s military officials turkish officials who are grappling with a separatist kurdish movement in their country say they would oppose the creation of an independent kurdistan in northern iraq they also say they are prepared to defend iraqs turkmen population who share a common ethnicity with turkeys majority population should it come under attack even syria which the u s alleges has been abetting the conflict is expressing alarm over the potential fracturing of iraq "can you imagine the effect of iraq breaking apart and each group looking for a regional or international power to support their territorial claims or their ethnic claims " asks imad moustapha syrias ambassador to washington "the repercussions will be terrible not just for iraq but for all the countries " an all out civil war in iraq that drags in bordering countries would send shockwaves through the global oil market potentially pushing oil prices to more than &# a barrel oil analysts predict iraq kuwait saudi arabia and iran together hold about two thirds of the worlds proven oil reserves two scholars kenneth pollack at the brookings institution and daniel byman of the rand corp have worked for months on a study that lays out possible consequences in a worst case scenario from skyrocketing oil prices to huge destabilizing refugee flows they argue that iraq could become the worlds premier sanctuary for terrorism and that strife there could spark minority uprisings in saudi arabia iran syria and even among turkeys sizable kurdish population iraqs neighbors fear the increasing reach of shiite iran whose expansion has been held in check for centuries by the sunnis of iraq among all of iraqs neighbors iran is the one country that could clearly benefit from a possible breakup of iraq along sectarian lines the emergence of a large oil rich and devoutly shiite arab state carved from iraqs southern half with a government closely tied to iran would radically alter the face of the middle east and grant more leverage to shiite leaders in tehran another core fear is that a sectarian bloodbath in iraq could draw in neighboring states which would feel pressed to defend their own interests or to protect their brethren in iraq last months bipartisan iraq study group report sketched out such a potential sequence of events based on interviews of senior arab diplomats by the panels top advisers in one of the bleakest public assessments to date of what it called the "consequences of continued decline in iraq " the report describes a potential cauldron of ethnic cleansing in iraq that could draw in the countrys main neighbors turkey from the north to prevent the iraqi kurds from declaring independence iran from the east to secure the countrys south and gain control over oil fields in that region "ambassadors from neighboring countries told us that they fear the distinct possibility of sunni shia clashes across the islamic world " the report notes "such a broader sectarian conflict could open a pandoras box of problems including the radicalization of populations mass movements of populations and regime changes that might take decades to play out " some of the study groups top advisers contend that the process of ethnic cleansing particularly by iraqi shiites trying to rid cities and regions of their sunni populations is already under way "we may be about one third through the process with little ability to do anything about it " says wayne white a former middle east intelligence official at the state department but critics of the panels core recommendation that the u s begin a rapid drawdown of american combat forces in iraq that would culminate in a full withdrawal of combat troops by early say such a move would leave a military vacuum in iraq that could open the way for an upsurge in shiite violence against the sunnis in iraq the sunni shiite split goes back to the early days of islam when a bloody feud broke out over which of the prophet muhammads descendants should lead the muslim faithful sunnis now predominate throughout the middle east with the exception of iran shiites have recently experienced a resurgence in influence in the region not just with the rise of iran but also with the shiite ascendancy in iraq and hezbollahs success in fighting israel in lebanon last summer high level arab officials have been warning for months that if left unchecked the current slide into chaos in iraq could spark a regional sectarian clash according to u s and arab diplomats they have begun to share their contingency plans with top u s officials in part because they hope to jolt the bush administration into taking stronger action in iraq and to secure the continued presence of u s troops there jordanian officials have suggested that if iraq were to fall into a full out civil war jordan would push troops to the border and possibly across it as far west as rutbah about miles inside iraq to stem an expected flow of sunni refugees says a u s military planner who recently met with leaders in the region "the danger is that if the jordanians carve out a security zone or buffer zone inside iraq that the syrians saudis and turks will all follow " says the military planner the syrians could move into western nineveh province while the turks could send troops to protect the sunni turkmen population in the north he says jordanian officials say they are driven by two main concerns the first is that sunnis fleeing shiite oppression could turn amman into the center of sunni resistance against the shiite dominated government in baghdad already the jordanian capital is home to about iraqis who make up as much as of the population the jordanians worry that iraqs shiite militias could send small teams of militants to amman to launch assassination campaigns or terror attacks against the sunni insurgency "we have quite enough instability in jordan as it is " says one senior jordanian official jordans other big fear is shared by the u s s other sunni allies throughout the region that an iraqi shiite government closely allied with iran could dominate the region jordan is one of the most uniformly sunni countries in the gulf but when u s military officials visited the region recently their jordanian counterparts described with alarm how of their sunni citizens had converted to shia islam in recent months the jordanians said the converts were motivated by the shiite dominated hezbollahs tough stand against israel over the summer and by the growing power of radical cleric moqtada al sadr in iraq "it seems preposterous but it shows how hyper reactive they are to it " says the u s military planner saudi arabia which has a sunni majority population but significant pockets of shiites in many of its oil rich provinces has also voiced alarm over the growing popularity of both hezbollah and the sadr movement in its own eastern expanses "the shiites in those provinces love sadr and nasrallah " hezbollahs leader the u s military planner says saudi officials also fret over the prospect of a deepening civil war in iraq a huge challenge for the u s is that many of its sunni allies in the region already view the current situation in iraq as a defeat for their cause and a near complete victory for iran "they refer to the shiite islamic parties in iraq as the persians " the military planner says using the historical term for persian speaking iranians in recent weeks some of the u s allies in the gulf have quietly advocated breaking up the iraqi government in favor of a military dictatorship governed by a secular shiite a sunni and a kurd according to the military planner the military dictatorship would rule until the country could be stabilized and new elections held religious parties like those that currently dominate iraqi politics would be banned from participating in future elections u s officials have ruled out such an option saying that it runs contrary to their desire to bring democracy to iraq and that it would never be accepted by iraqs shiites who are already largely in control some middle east analysts dismiss the possibility of intervention in iraq by its sunni led neighbors saying these fragile regimes are interested foremost in their own survival but u s officials say the paranoia surrounding iran and the rise of shiite influence could lead them to conclude that their survival depends on intervening on behalf of iraqs sunni minority some of the war gaming both within the bush administration and among outside experts focuses on such potential scenarios under one scenario sketched by mr white of the iraq study group iraqs shiites would launch an extensive campaign to drive the sunnis out of large areas of central iraq fearing a rout of the sunni population saudi arabia would finance a large scale counteroffensive funneling aid to former iraqi military officers through jordan which has longstanding ties to iraqs sunni military class egypt would do its part by providing guns munitions artillery and vehicles "what people forget is that the sunnis comprise nearly the entire top brass of the former iraqi army and nearly all of the old republican guard " says mr white "you give them the guns and proper equipment and they will become a formidable force against the shiite militias " the possibility of a full blown civil war in iraq dissolving into a regional conflict "is a scenario that nearly everyone was rejecting just a few months ago " he says "not anymore "
