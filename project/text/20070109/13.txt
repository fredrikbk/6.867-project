business technology talking tech q&amp a on r&amp d the big issues companies may pay lip service to the important role that research and development plays in the process of innovation but that doesnt necessarily mean that they actually do a good job with their r&amp d the consulting group booz allen hamilton has done two annual surveys of corporate research the first discovered that there was no correlation between the amount of r&amp d spending at a company and its financial performance the second study just completed discovered a number of "high leverage innovators" who spend less on r&amp d than their peers but seem to get more product bang for their r&amp d buck because billions of dollars are at stake we talked with booz allen hamiltons barry jaruzelski about some of the issues involved in r&amp d spending q who are some of the "high leverage" innovators and what do they have in common a it included folks like samsung apple toyota google christian dior and black &amp decker when we interviewed them we found several common themes the first was that they viewed innovation as an end to end process that involved all functions in the company senior management had real visibility into what was going on in the product development process there was also a deep customer understating which allowed these companies to make the kind of trade offs you need to make in creating new products q what does a company like black &amp decker do well a it does very deep market research and testing of concepts with consumers and not just your typical male weekend do it yourselfer but all sorts of other segments like women for women that means lighter tools with smaller but still powerful motors that are more conducive to someone of less arm strength q but cant you spend too little on research a if you are in the bottom of your industry in r&amp d spending that is a problem because you can really starve the enterprise otherwise where you decide to invest your r&amp d spending and how you conduct it is far more important than absolute dollars q dont most people think more r&amp d spending is always good a if i create the greatest new mousetrap but marketing or sales or manufacturing doesnt do its job it doesnt matter there are plenty of examples of where bigger r&amp d budgets didnt translate to better outcomes digital equipment did an interesting internal analysis of their greatest successes like the microvax computer and they all were developed with very small focused teams with comparatively small budgets unlike digitals alpha microprocessor chip which had a huge budget but was a market failure when it came out it was the largest integrated circuit on the planet q do companies manage their r&amp d process very well a we found that r&amp d is often the least managed function think about sales or marketing or manufacturing all have long tradition of rigorous metrics based management but having that kind of numerical rigor around product development is still viewed askance by some people q but isnt r&amp d a creative process and thus hard to manage a i had this conversation with one head of r&amp d and he said r&amp d is a bit like writing a novel i responded well doesnt the publisher ask for an outline q what is the relationship between having patents and better performance a if your objective is more patents more r&amp d spending will produce more patents but there is no relationship between how many patents you generate and how well you perform financially q so is all this good news or bad a its much more about the quality of the r&amp d team and the quality of the process and the quality of how you make decisions than it is about the amount of money you spend thats good news it shows how companies with less resources are able to make major discoveries
