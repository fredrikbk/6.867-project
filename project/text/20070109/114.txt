the afternoon report radio activity howard stern the self described king of all media was paid a royal ransom in stock by his satellite radio bosses today but investors trying to tune in gains in the sector are getting little more than dead air sirius satellite radio disclosed that it has dished out million shares worth approximately &# million to its biggest star on the one year anniversary of his first satellite broadcast despite blossoming into one of traditional radios most popular figures the merrily lewd mr stern chafed at the oversight of broadcast decency regulators and his corporate bosses and made the jump to sirius in late when the company claimed only subscribers the five year deal he signed included some annual subscription benchmarks and todays payout was tied to those when mr stern landed at sirius analysts figured about million subscribers by the end of was doable but sirius finished with six million subscribers on the rolls easily blowing out forecasts and fattening mr sterns already bulging pockets sirius ceo mel karmazin beamed that the investment in mr stern "has dramatically paid off " shareholders may be less effusive mr sterns popularity has unquestionably made sirius a credible threat to chief competitor xm satellite radio holdings xm boasted more subscribers at the end of last year some seven million to siriuss six million but sirius has been closing fast all the same both companies have experienced plenty of static in their stock price in the last year subscriptions havent kept up with wall streets recent forecasts and both companies have spent richly to secure broadcasting rights for major sports and bring in top drawer talent like mr stern and oprah winfrey who hosts a show on xm and despite that spending consumers arent exactly rushing to get their hands on satellite radio gear some analysts had hoped that xm and sirius might get a boost during an electronics mad holiday season but analysts at banc of america securities observed that "persistent soft demand at retail seems to eliminate the possibility that there was a late december bump " some observers muse that the two companies could strengthen their hand by teaming up a combined company would be better able to cope with the threat posed by digital music players and the internet but large obstacles loom in the path of any deal regulators could push back since a tie up would basically dissolve what little competition there is in the sector and the political climate for a combination is always subject to change analysts at deutsche bank think a deal would take around six to nine months to complete providing only a narrow opening for talks the presidential election cycle may make action tough in the analysts say meaning that "if there is a window to act it is one that could close " sirius stock was up more than in nasdaq trade this morning while xm shares were marginally higher crude crumples stocks meander oil prices continued to fall down a well sliding
