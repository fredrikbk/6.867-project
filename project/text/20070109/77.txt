money depot the huge rewards of failure for some ceos congratulations to the journal for its excellent jan coverage on the demise of robert nardelli as chief executive of home depot "amid a pay dispute home depots chief faced board tensions " page one beyond reporting the facts and history the journal provided a more valuable service to readers by analyzing why things went so wrong special praise goes to alan murrays thoughtful page one article "failing to understand new demands on ceos " which analyzed how the skills required to manage the top job are quite different from those that produced success at a lower rank a different corporate culture and another age karen richardsons "heard on the street" "the six sigma factor for home depot" showed that reliance on quantitative management process programs like six sigma is no guarantee of success of course the real irony here is that some ceos who believe government could benefit from business methods may begin to see that they themselves may benefit from the political diplomatic skills so necessary for success in effective government leaving aside the propriety of "heads i win tails you lose" compensation packages senior management and corporate directors need to understand that the age of information reporting that is both thorough and instantaneous has placed them in the same boat as members of congress running for re election is a continual part of the job gerard coffey vice president g a kraut co new york when a chief executive has an exit package that in one day can make him his family and future generations rich beyond most peoples wildest dreams is it not possible to suspect that when things arent going too well they might not have a real sincere interest in making the tough decisions to turn things around when the stock price was plummeting unions were angry and the board was making nasty comments inside and outside the boardroom might mr nardelli possibly have thought "oh well the worst that will happen is that ill get fired get my &# million and i can retire " some people chastise certain ceos for taking too much pay when they are performing well but how foolish can a board of directors be to offer a chief executive &# million to fail home depots board brought this problem on themselves i hope they and other public corporations can amend this practice in the future george h d schulz chicago according to one of your front page articles mr nardellis fatal flaw was "failing to understand new demands on ceos " leading to his departure from home depot with more than &# million my already boggled brain is pushed over the edge trying to understand how much he would have received if he had succeeded in understanding the new demands with rewards like this for failure maybe the journal should consider a piece on how business schools around the country are doing in offering courses with tentative titles like "how to fail successfully in the higher levels of corporate america " stephen n miller waban mass
