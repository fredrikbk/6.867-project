pin money democrats have consistently refused to discuss any social security reform requiring a carve out account where workers can invest a portion of the of their payroll taxes recently treasury secretary hank paulson has shown a readiness to explore bipartisan approaches to social security reform without any prerequisites a bipartisan plan for reform can be built on a modified version of progressive indexing without carve out accounts in social security but with enhancements of existing retirement accounts progressive indexing pin preserves the current schedule of social security benefits for the lowest of wage earners as well as for already retired workers and those who will retire before by contrast pin slows the growth of initial social security benefits for the top wage earners to the annual increase in consumer prices price indexing as opposed to the annual increase in wages wage indexing for all those workers in between pin provides for lower benefits than the current schedule but benefits that grow faster than increases in consumer prices through a blend of price and wage indexing in total pin reduces the present value of the year deficit of social security by close to &# trillion to approximately &# trillion a progressive approach to social security is justified because federal taxes forgone from k s and iras exceed &# billion per year which primarily benefit high and middle earners yet pin should be modified to deal with four major criticisms first because social security benefits are growing faster for lower wage workers than middle and higher wage workers the benefits for all workers would become roughly the same at some date in the next century this criticism can easily be rebutted by stopping pin after years when there will still be substantial benefit differences between wage groups second while wages have historically grown over faster per year than prices critics have pointed out this relationship could possibly reverse at some point over the next years in this unlikely event the initial social security benefits for high earners would grow faster than those of low earners under pin as originally designed to avoid this anomaly initial social security benefits should be indexed to wage growth for all workers if during the years prior to their retirement prices rose faster than wages third the original form of pin did not address the complex issues involved with social security benefits for the disabled additional savings to hold harmless the disabled could be generated by combining pin with longevity indexing after under longevity indexing the benefit schedule at normal retirement age nra would be adjusted to keep constant relative to the average wage level the estimated lifetime benefits from social security in response to increasing life expectancy without changing the nra itself for example if life expectancy rises to from between and the benefit schedule for social security under longevity indexing would be the same in wage indexed dollars for a worker retiring at age in as for someone retiring at age in with the same average career earning this combination would generate enough savings not only to preserve current social security benefits for the disabled but also to improve the benefit schedule for median wage workers under pin thus dealing with the fourth major criticism of pin since a combination of pin and longevity indexing would not include a carve out account this would present a political challenge to republicans one response could be an expansion of other types of private accounts for retirement most workers earning more than &# per year do not meet the eligibility requirements for the roth individual retirement account ira which allows investment earnings from after tax contributions to be excluded permanently from federal income taxes if all income limits were taken off the roth ira higher wage workers would be eligible for its tax advantages this would promote retirement savings by these higher earners whose social security benefits would be growing at the slowest rate under pin congress could also expand the existing savers credit for retirement plan contributions by low income households that nonrefundable credit is limited to joint filers with adjusted gross annual income of &# or less however the credit is poorly designed because most families below that income level do not pay income taxes congress could make the credit partially refundable to help those low wage workers whose social security benefits will grow a little slower under pin between &# and &# in annual earnings some democrats would support the combination of pin and longevity indexing because it substantially improves the solvency and fairness of social security without raising taxes nevertheless other democrats may object to this combination because it relies too heavily on benefit changes rather than revenue increases although president bush has rejected any increase in the rate for the social security tax he has reserved judgment on increasing the maximum wages not income subject to social security taxes in when most social security reforms start to be implemented this maximum would be approximately &# per year for these reasons some commentators have proposed raising the maximum wage base subject to the social security tax to &# or &# per year however this would be an unfair and huge tax increase for those with annual earnings in the &# range they would be subject to an additional tax on all or almost all of the earnings by contrast those earning &# million or more annually would be subject to the tax on a tenth or less of their earnings a better approach would be a surcharge from the employee and from the employer on all earnings above the maximum wage base like the medicare tax in for example that would mean on the first &# in earnings and on all earnings above that amount such a surcharge would close approximately of the current long term deficit of social security if no incremental benefits were associated with the surtax the revenues from the surcharge could be applied to improve the benefit schedule for median wage workers under pin however a surcharge on high wage workers without any incremental benefits would violate the fundamental principle of social security as a social insurance program in the long run this could undermine political support among high earners for the program a major concern among democrats one alternative would be to provide a modest stream of benefits for every &# in surcharge paid by the employee but even a modest stream will result in a very large and unseemly annual benefit from social security for multimillionaires a better alternative would be to devote the from the employer to restore the solvency of social security and to allow all of the from the employee to be contributed to a roth ira or half of the over &# million per year this alternative would link the surcharge to additional retirement benefits and permit a further improvement in pins benefit schedule for median workers it would also make the surcharge more palatable to republicans in short there are a number of workable plans to reform social security with enhanced retirement accounts if both political parties are willing to compromise mr pozen is chairman of mfs investment management
