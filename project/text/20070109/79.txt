muni bonds attract arbs yield pattern offers profit opportunity fed poses a threat amid skimpier yields big investors looking to eke out some returns have turned increasingly to the municipal bond market treasury yields are inverted an anomaly in which long maturity bonds yield less than short term issues but in the once staid muni market where the pattern of yields is more normal hedge funds and other large players are finding it easier to profit from sophisticated trading strategies still they could run into problems particularly if the economy holds up better than expected and the federal reserve disappoints expectations for a rate cut instead raising its benchmark short term rate from the current that could undermine a popular arbitrage play that has lured them into the tax exempt market "its a difficult time" for investors deploying the arbitrage trade says matt fabian senior analyst at municipal market advisors a concord mass research firm that focuses on munis "if there were another fed rate increase it could be devastating for some of these guys " arbitrage strategies let investors exploit unusual shifts in relationships between securities within an asset class or between market sectors currently the &# trillion muni market offers such an opportunity because long term yields there are about to percentage point higher than money market rates that can make it profitable to borrow short term funds and use the proceeds to buy long maturities such players known as "arbs" in market parlance can further increase returns by borrowing heavily against the value of the securities they buy levering up the position in treasurys such strategies grew unworkable after the fed began lifting short term rates from their ultra low level in mid at late yesterday the year treasury yield stood more than half a percentage point below the fed funds rate but typically as money flows into "arb plays " the opportunities disappear in munis strong demand for long term issues has helped lift prices and pull down yields which move inversely that gradually has eroded the profitability of the trade after decembers stronger than forecast payrolls growth investors have another worry maybe the economy is rebounding and the fed isnt done tightening policy the double whammy of diminishing profitability and the possibility of another fed rate increase would hit hardest those who entered an arb strategy most recently at slimmer spreads but so far no one appears to be pulling out "we havent seen any signs that they are packing up their toys and going home " thalia meehan head of tax exempt research at putnam investments in boston says about the arbs demand for muni arbitrage remains healthy says keith pagan who oversees a fund that invests in individual arbitrage funds at gem capital llc of belevdere calif he plans two new offerings soon one on behalf of a new york based broker dealer and another for pension funds endowments and foundations if the muni yield curve flattens more the allure would be reduced he says but "even at these somewhat flatter relative curve levels you still have a more attractive opportunity than in many other fixed income areas " treasurys slide a bit kohn speech toes line benchmarks other than the year treasury bond were a bit lower yesterday in quiet trading prices had been down modestly ahead of a speech by
