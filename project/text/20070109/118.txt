the evening wrap dialing for dominance macworld deftly stole the consumer electronics shows thunder today as apple rolled out what it hopes will be the phone to end all phones as many observers had keenly anticipated apple ceo steve jobs climbed on to the stage at macworld in san francisco and introduced the iphone the computer giants latest foray into the crowded cellphone sector as a feat of design and innovation the iphone appears every bit as intriguing as the ipod music player that has powered apples renaissance less than half an inch thick it forgoes a keypad and instead deploys touchscreen technology to dial calls listen to music watch videos or sync up to a computer "apple is going to reinvent the phone " mr jobs bragged to attendees at the applepalooza a previous apple phone called the rokr designed and produced by motorola had rolled into obscurity thanks to a stingy storage capacity and less than sleek look apple dished out some other fresh gear including a widescreen ipod and a gadget dubbed "apple tv" that allows users to pipe web video content to a television but it was the iphone that everyone had been waiting for and it was the iphone that sent

memory just look around a subway car a gym or wherever ipods signature white earbuds are nearly inescapable but wall street was beginning to worry that the device had reached a saturation level and

muscling into the phone business stands to be a much bloodier proposition the iphone may very well bludgeon so called smartphones into submission but plenty more pedestrian phones provide users music functions cingular wireless which is teaming up with apple to provide service for the iphone already launched a music service on its network including the likes of napster yahoo and emusic iphones hefty price tag &# is also likely to put it out of reach of the budget conscious in the meantime the economies of the cellphone business have left sector stalwarts on the mat motorola warned of an earnings shortfall last week putting one final flourish atop the heaping helping of news mr jobs said his company would now be known only as apple dropping the "computer" from its name thats as telling a sign as any of the companys shift toward consumer electronics but if users hang up on the iphone investors may conclude apple has rolled rather far from the tree crude crumples stocks
