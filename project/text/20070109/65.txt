in new orleans these gumshoes can float your boat vessels strewn by katrina still litter peoples yards saga of the chris &amp shane new orleans scott chappuis was relieved when he returned to his new orleans neighborhood after hurricane katrina and saw that his house had survived a foot high surge of flood water but there was one problem a big shrimp trawler called the chris &amp shane was marooned in the yard more than a year later it was still there nobody showed up to claim the foot boat the u s coast guard refused to haul it away because it is responsible only for vessels in navigable waterways a contractor who had volunteered to help quit when the chris &amp shane started leaking diesel fuel he didnt want to incur potential environmental liability the mess landed on the desks of john rogers and r bruce hammatt of the louisiana department of environmental quality they became gumshoes of last resort for an estimated to commercial and recreational boats that are still strewn across parking lots roads marshes and other odd spots throughout southeastern louisiana it takes a lot of detective work to reunite orphaned boats with their owners many phone lines were never restored after the hurricane some owners scattered by the storm havent returned while others either figured that their boats had sunk or had been sucked out to sea some just dont care because they were paid off by insurers katrina also left some boat owners too poor to afford removal costs that can run as high as &# for large vessels that need cranes trucks and other heavy equipment to haul them away the flotilla of abandoned boats is a reminder of the fitful recovery the citys population is still less than half the prestorm level of about in july population has rebounded in some suburbs but many areas remain wrecked whole neighborhoods that were flooded such as the lower ninth ward are largely empty and uninhabited currently only of the public schools have reopened and only of city buses in new orleans are running according to brookings institution which publishes monthly updates on the citys post katrina recovery one pontoon dock beached near the hurricane ravaged city of slidell sprouted a cypress tree and residents had plans to trim it with christmas lights tinsel and ornaments "we were going to make a real party out of it " says danny green a retired state trooper but after the times picayune ran a newspaper story about it local officials had the hulk hauled away by truck ruptured fuel tanks are seeping diesel fuel and oil into the ground and marshes cars must maneuver around a thicket of fishing vessels encroaching on a state highway in eastern new orleans about six boats are piled up at one end of a bridge in empire la near the mouth of the mississippi after katrina the coast guard quickly restored boat traffic up and down the river but many marshes and bayous remain snarled with boats and debris coast guard officials removed about boats that were deemed a threat to shipping then a joint state federal disaster management team asked the louisiana department of environmental quality to take over the job which involves dealing with frazzled boat owners and residents messrs rogers and hammatt barely knew each other before they teamed up in may when mr hammatt started wrangling with contractors hired to remove marooned boats an administrator and adviser at the department of environmental quality he brought intensity to their detective work "its hammatt like damn it " said mr hammatt years old to one property owner recently mr rogers spent weeks on the case of a pontoon style party barge bearing a registration number that didnt pop up in a computer search the break came when he realized that a "" in the number actually was a storm battered " " the owner didnt want the boat so it was sold for &# through an online auction with the proceeds going to the federal emergency management agency which picks up certain boat removal costs once or twice a week the two men sign out a vehicle from the deq motor pool in baton rouge and hit the road to hunt for clues and wrestle with the paperwork and personalities that must be navigated in every boat rescue lyle stockstill who runs his familys fuel dock and the ugly duck bar in empire was cooking oxtail soup last month when messrs rogers and hammatt pulled up with a "right to entry" form that would give a contractor permission to haul away crushed boats near his three story house "its terrible " mr stockstill said later "i have my place fixed up but i have this junkyard in front " he said his wife would sign the form adding that he would be happy to see the boats removed messrs rogers and hammatt are patient with struggling boat owners who show signs of trying to take responsibility for their beached vessels at a stop to check on a trawler called lucky boat they saw wooden blocks under the boat and a cleared section of sugar cane field "this is excellent " mr hammatt said they have spent the past six months working on the chris &amp shane project next to mr chappuiss house it wasnt hard to track down the shrimp boats owner jules b kain sr who had tied the craft to a dock as katrina was approaching mr kain didnt have the money to move his boat named for the children of its original owner he lives in a fema trailer because katrina wrecked his house in the violet community of st bernard parish "the last two years of trawling werent that great " says mr kain "we were just surviving " this time the roadblock was that mr chappuis a new orleans fire department captain refused to sign a "hold harmless" agreement waiving his right to sue over any damage or injuries that might occur during the boats removal mr rogers who had lined up &# in federal funding to pay for getting rid of the trawler says that for months the department cajoled mr chappuis to sign the document finally he threatened to simply leave the chris &amp shane in mr chappuiss yard forever the homeowner relented last month giant air bags were inflated under the boat and a tractor pushed on the stern plunging the chris &amp shane back into the water a work boat towed away the freed vessel to be sliced into scrap metal mr rogers joked that mr chappuis wouldnt have the "biggest lawn ornament" anymore "right " mr chappuis replied then walked away he says hell miss the boat "like a headache or a hemorrhoid "
