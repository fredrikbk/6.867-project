roberta wohlstetter codebreaker when roberta wohlstetter set out in the early s to explain why the u s had been surprised by the japanese attack on pearl harbor she confronted a puzzle that to some seemed like a conspiracy unlike classic military surprises the u s had received ample intelligence that the japanese were prepared to attack the hawaiian base that nothing was done to remove american ships to safety was proof for clare booth luce among others that franklin roosevelt had "lied us into war because he didnt have the courage to lead us into it " but wohlstetter who died saturday at age knew better and she spelled it all out in "pearl harbor warning and decision " perhaps the most important book ever written on military intelligence yes the u s had intelligence that pearl harbor was a potential japanese target but other intelligence suggested siberia could be a target or the panama canal or the philippines previous indications of an impending attack had served like so many false alarms to lower americas guard and american planners had trouble believing the japanese would launch a war against the united states that they couldnt possibly hope to win from this wohlstetter drew the essential conclusion that the u s failed to anticipate the attack on pearl harbor because amid mountains of incomplete and often conflicting data what she called "noise" intelligence analysts couldnt distinguish the information that really mattered this tended to lead as the future nobelist thomas schelling wrote in his preface to wohlstetters book to "a routine obsession with a few dangers that may be familiar rather than likely " the lessons are timeless and foretold the findings of the commission contrary to the views of many so called realists nations do not always act from rational calculations of their self interests they can be reckless gamblers something that should give pause to those who see nothing to worry about in the prospect of an iranian nuclear weapon and contrary to the instincts of many cia "professionals " the best intelligence analysis requires judgment and imagination not simply the widest possible data set wohlstetter was also remarkable not simply as a woman working in what was then a "mans field " but also as the wife and intellectual partner of the late albert wohlstetter the legendary nuclear strategy theorist both albert and roberta were great friends of this page as well as great patriots
