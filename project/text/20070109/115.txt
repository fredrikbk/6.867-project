the continuing saga of everymans library when sonny mehta chairman and editor in chief of the knopf publishing group was growing up in "postcolonial india " his formative experience of well presented literature came through books from the everymans library an english imprint begun in by bookbinder turned publisher joseph malaby dent "they were cheap they were accessible one found them in bookstores " recalled mr mehta speaking recently by telephone from london where he was on a trip to confer with u k authors "if you were given books as gifts they tended to be everymans a lot of my early reading with classics though one didnt even know they were classics i mean whether it was dumas or jules verne or anything else thats what they tended to be " those books the young mr mehta so took for granted were it seems models of the bookbinders art "what one realized afterwards " he said with a chuckle "was that one was very lucky they had very sturdy bindings they tended to have ribbon markers and i suppose until one entered publishing one didnt really know how unusual this was " everymans librarys very first turn of the th century titles were priced at an affordable one shilling each "for a few shillings " proposed j m dent an autodidact whod risen from humble origins "the reader may have a whole bookshelf of the immortals for five pounds a man may be intellectually rich for life " the earliest everymans list offered boswells life of johnson and the complete works of austen and dickens later el authors included dostoevsky stendhal robert louis stevenson henry james joseph conrad and virginia woolf founder dent died in but his library thrived by the small privately owned firms th anniversary in it was said that everymans library had published over a thousand titles and sold some million books "quite a substantial achievement by anybodys standards " mr mehta noted but time slowed everymans progress the paperback revolution made classics available in even cheaper form the library languished throughout the s and s publishing few new volumes meanwhile its american born counterpart the modern library soldiered on and in the library of america began its ambitious program of publishing essential works of american literature in handsome uniform relatively inexpensive hardcover editions then in independent british publisher david campbell acquired hardcover rights to everymans library and told his friend sonny mehta by then president and editor in chief of alfred a knopf that he sought an american partner "i just loved the idea of the library being relaunched " mr mehta recalled "and about trying to do it to a standard that made the books really quite distinctive and which id always associated with the original everyman " a revived line with an initial titles austen to zola was debuted by random house uk and knopf in the u s in since then the everymans library with old and new incarnations celebrating a combined th anniversary in the year just completed has done titles and sold million books in the course of that centenary year knopf publicity director nicholas latimer reports amazon "received a number of orders for the entire set of the everyman essentials the books in the series that we put together to help people build an instant library of classics " and while those books are competitively priced &# for a collection of dickinson poems &# for thomas manns hefty "joseph and his brothers" they are not done "on the cheap " mr mehta said "theyve got full cloth bindings which is rare we found a way of keeping the ribbon marker and we are using the best acid free paper we can find we are producing a permanent library essentially " that library now includes a line of "contemporary classics" by such canon worthy late th century writers as fitzgerald both f scott and penelope toni morrison naguib mahfouz and cormac mccarthy a development welcomed by a number of book readers and booksellers "thats been tremendously exciting for us that updating of the list in really attractive jackets " said paul yamazaki longtime manager of the legendary city lights bookstore in san francisco where last years national book awards nominees were announced "when we look at these everymans and modern library reprint lines and i would also add the new york review of books classics which is a more recent line in many cases they reintroduce these books to readers and in a certain sense if youve never read a book all the books are new the everymans retained that classic look that theyve had over the last hundred years theyre really beautiful with the ribbon in there and for people my age group over many of us when we read a new dickens or something like the cormac mccarthy which has just come out recently in everymans or the mahfouz that goes up onto our shelves and replaces our old tattered paperbacks and it kind of reinspires you to go back and read some of the things that you may have not read in or or years " many may receive such inspiration from one of everymans librarys half dozen anniversary year volumes "we tell ourselves stories in order to live" &# a page omnibus of seven nonfiction books by joan didion a living author who relates with personal immediacy to the els aesthetic goals "i dont know if you remember what it was like " the california born writer asked recently by telephone from new york "to first have a book in your hand whenever it was that you first bought a book a whole lot of its appeal had to do with the way it looked and felt i remember very distinctly somebody gave me a merchandise award at a bookstore in sacramento and i bought a modern library of emily dickinson and the collected poems of t s eliot and the eliot had a smooth yellow cover and the emily dickinson had sort of a classic modern library cover pink and gray and black i mean it was the physical appearance of these books that meant a whole lot to me then " and the physical appearance of everymans library volumes is pleasing to her now ms didion said "theyre lovely books i mean you dont get books anymore that have sewn bindings you know or that have little ribbons in them theyre so compact that they dont take up much room and its sort of easy to read because its an attractive typeface " ms didion dissents from the suggestion that an "everymans library" might be an embattled notion today in a cultural milieu so different from j m dents "obviously the internet is fantastic for doing research and stuff like that but i dont think its a very satisfying way to read the idea of collecting books is a luxury obviously part of that sort of implies that there is order in your life theres shelves to put the books on i think its an idea thats increasingly attractive to a lot of people " mr mehta concurs "i think weve sold something like copies of pride and prejudice just this past year which is not bad for a th century novel and about copies i believe of the divine comedy " as for the didion the publisher said he expects to sell "between and copies of it in the next few months " but sales figures and cultural rationales seem beside the point when the civilized object at hand is itself a sort of artwork "have you had a chance to look at any of the books " asked mr mehta "ah but its a great thing isnt it ive a whole shelfful of them at home i just love the way they look " mr nolan is the author of "ross macdonald a biography" and editor of "the couple next door collected short mysteries" by margaret millar
