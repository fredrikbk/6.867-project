politics &amp economics murtha outlines strategy to restrict troop surge washington with president bush seeking more u s forces in iraq a house democratic chairman outlined options that would restrict any troop surge if it meant depleting readiness at home or extending the tours of troops now in the war zone the strategy laid out by rep john murtha d pa is the clearest statement yet on how house democrats may respond to anticipated white house proposals to add troops and pump new money into economic programs to help iraqi civilians mr bush will address the nation tomorrow on iraq and the pentagon is preparing to add four brigades plus support personnel in the coming months in the same period congress will be considering an emergency bill to pay for continuing overseas military operations and the restrictions could be added prior to enactment in late march and before the white house has deployed all the added brigades overseas mr bush is sure to claim wide discretion as commander in chief under the constitution most democrats want to avoid what they see as a fruitless and politically damaging fight to deny money for the war "were not about to cut off funding for troops " house armed services committee chairman ike skelton d mo said but mr murtha chairman of the house appropriations defense subcommittee believes the november election results show voters want congress to be more of a check on mr bushs handling of iraq his goal is to build bipartisan support by focusing the debate on whether increasing troop levels would be too much of a strain on the military "most of the military commanders say we cant afford to send more troops " mr murtha said and he has urged the presidents national security adviser stephen hadley to expedite submission of the war funding requests to facilitate hearings and debate the chairman met recently at the white house with mr hadley vice president cheney and the president regarding iraq policy but remains skeptical of the administrations approach he is planning a set of hearings beginning this month on the state of army and marine corps readiness as chairman he can recommend that the restrictions be part of the text of the funding bill and challenge others to take out the language "they will say were micromanaging the defense department well they need to be micromanaged " he said "what we decide is the direction of the country on this war " among the options is a provision that proscribes the use of new funds to extend the deployment of army and marine troops beyond and days respectively a second provision would bar the dispatch of more troops if a fixed percent of units left at home fall below readiness standards the readiness of army units for combat is measured on a scale of one to four units rated at the lower ends of the spectrum three and four are missing key leaders training or pieces of equipment that make them ineligible to deploy the exact readiness levels of u s units are classified but senior army officials and lawmakers have acknowledged in recent weeks that almost all the big active duty combat brigades in the u s currently arent ready to deploy forcing the bush administration to maintain a certain percentage of units in the u s at high readiness levels could constrain the presidents ability to follow through on his plan to "surge" troops into baghdad it could also force the administration to call some national guard and reserve units back for a second year long tour of duty in iraq greg jaffe contributed to this article
