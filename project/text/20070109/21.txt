ceo politics for an excellent example of why federal agencies so rarely admit mistakes look no further than the recent uproar over the securities and exchange commissions flip flop on stock option disclosure house financial services chairman barney frank is already planning to ride this error through the next election as part of his campaign against ceo pay the sec has been under attack since it announced on the eve of christmas weekend that it was modifying its july disclosure rule on executive compensation the commissions new order tweaks the way stock option grants are disclosed with the goal of making total annual compensation figures more accurate and consistent chairman christopher cox admitted that the sec had inadvertently adopted the wrong version of one part of the rule and was simply trying to set things right that mea culpa counted little with mr frank who denounced the sec for loosening reporting requirements to provide a "christmas eve" gift to corporate america he also declared that this "backtracking" by the agency meant his committee now had an obligation to dive into the "problem" of "unconstrained" executive compensation as if he needed an excuse this political opportunism is especially unfortunate because the new sec rule is entirely in keeping with mr coxs goal of bringing more "clarity and consistency" to corporate pay disclosure even mr frank praised the secs decision last year to require companies to aggregate all of their top executives compensation pay bonuses perks options into one bottom line figure when these reports begin to become public later this year investors will get a better look at management costs and be able to compare those numbers across companies under the flawed sec rule companies would have had to include in their annual total compensation reporting any stock option grants awarded during the year this would have been highly misleading to the extent such grants werent yet exercisable and thus might never be "in the money " under the new rule companies will instead include any options that actually vest that year meaning options that executives can truly turn into cash or stock contrary to most media descriptions the new rule wont necessarily result in lower reported compensation numbers under the old rule a big grant would only appear in the year it was awarded then disappear in subsequent disclosures under the new rule the final figure will include any and all previous option awards that vest in that year leading in many cases to more substantial bottom line figures meanwhile information about big annual option grants is still readily available to investors albeit in a different section of the sec compensation form this change will also harmonize the new compensation disclosure forms with other corporate financial statements under current accounting rules companies only expense options in their financial statements as the options become exercisable given that the secs goal with its disclosure rule was to make compensation figures more consistent and understandable for investors it would have made little sense to set up two completely different ways of counting options the secs mistake is regrettable but the agency might be forgiven for overlooking what was a relatively minor point in its gigantic page july rule and one reason it didnt hold a public meeting on the new amendment is that all five sec commissioners including its two democrats unanimously agreed that the change was necessary mr frank surely knows all this but he is hunting bigger political game namely running against "excessive" ceo pay and alleged "inequality" as democrats gin up a campaign issue for the left believes its neo populism paid off in novembers election and it wants to ratchet up the rhetoric this year in congress as part of his investigation we can only hope mr frank explores the role that the last democratic congress played in encouraging ceo stock option grants by limiting to &# million the amount of executive cash compensation that companies could deduct from taxes bob nardelli frank raines and hank mckinnell among others are grateful but then again that would mean admitting that congress made a mistake its so much easier to demagogue ceos and the sec
