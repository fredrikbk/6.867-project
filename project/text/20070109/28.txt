chavez moves new socialism to faster track venezuela leader vows to nationalize telecom electricity giants venezuelan president hugo chavez took a big step toward what he calls "st century socialism" by vowing to nationalize the countrys biggest telecommunications and electricity companies both controlled by u s firms he also said he would throw out the countrys commercial code and strip the central bank of all remaining traces of its autonomy the moves by mr chavez a populist who won a landslide re election last month are the latest in a flurry of actions to tighten his grip on power and use his countrys oil riches to create a model of development different from the market oriented economics that have dominated latin america and much of the developing world for the past two decades some venezuelans fear that mr chavez a close ally and disciple of cubas ailing dictator fidel castro is reshaping venezuela along cuban lines with the state controlling economic and political power the venezuelan leader has denied the comparison in the past but critics said his latest moves belie the denial "lets call a spade a spade this is communism " said eric ekvall a political analyst in caracas "hes clearly saying the state should own the means of production " mr chavez whom the ailing cuban leader sees as the successor to his revolutionary mantle in latin america used a speech yesterday to his new cabinet members to flaunt his ties to mr castro he ended his speech using the cubans signature sign off "fatherland or death we will triumph " mr chavezs longtime ally former vice president jose vicente rangel chimed in at the ceremony with another signature castro phrase "always towards victory comandante " years after the collapse of soviet communism and the embrace of free markets by countries around the world mr chavez is taking this andean nation of million in the other direction greatly expanding the role of government in the economy in the past few years he has claimed a greater share of the countrys giant oil industry for the state but he has stopped shy of going directly after other major private industry until now although he revealed no details mr chavez said he would nationalize the countrys largest publicly traded private company compania nacional de telefonos de venezuela known as cantv the company privatized in is controlled by the u s telecom giant verizon communications inc he also vowed to nationalize electricidad de caracas controlled by arlington va based aes corp the choice of two u s controlled companies will surely not be missed elsewhere in latin america where mr chavez has struggled to convince nations to follow his lead and not washingtons since mr chavez took office in he has engaged in vigorous verbal combat with bush administration officials going as far as to compare mr bush to the devil in an appearance last year at the united nations but despite all the rhetorical flourishes the two countries are bound at the hip venezuela remains the u s s fourth largest oil supplier and the u s is by far venezuelas most important trading partner neither seems ready to cut that economic tie washington has tried of late to avoid being drawn into the fray yesterday there was no official reaction by u s government officials to mr chavezs announcement mr chavez offered no details of how the nationalization would proceed or whether shareholders in the private companies would receive market value for their stakes as one of the worlds top oil producing nations and founding member of the organization of petroleum exporting countries venezuela is flush with cash from high oil prices and could easily pay compensation in a statement verizon said it wasnt aware of the details of the governments plan and couldnt issue a comment it had agreed to a day extension through feb of its agreement to sell its stake in cantv to mexicos america movil the mobile phone company controlled by billionaire carlos slim for &# million on the new york stock exchange cantv shares fell to &# before trading was halted shortly after p m eastern time people familiar with the matter said verizon had known since august that mr chavez was considering nationalizing the company they said the company was hopeful it might still reach an agreement with the fiery leader allowing the sale to proceed a spokesman for mr slim had no comment aes spokesman robin pence said the company had no comment mr chavez also is consolidating power in the political arena soon after the recent election he unveiled plans to join his coalition of some center and leftist parties into a single party controlled by him called the united venezuelan socialist party a move some analysts say leads the country down the road to a single party state yesterday he said he would ask congress for special powers to pass bills by decree in recent years mr chavez has rewritten the constitution and stacked the supreme court with loyalists venezuelas congress entirely made up of supporters to mr chavez after the opposition didnt field candidates plans to amend the constitution again to allow him indefinite re election in addition mr chavez is going after one of the few institutions he doesnt control the media he recently said he would yank the broadcast license of one of the countrys oldest tv broadcasters and most outspoken critics of his policies rctv yesterday mr chavez repeatedly called the secretary general of the organization of american states jose miguel insulza an "idiot" for condemning the venezuelans decision not to renew the channels license since the price of oil began to rise a few years ago many countries from russia to nigeria have reclaimed a bigger share of their energy industries to cash in but venezuela appears to be going further daniel yergin chairman of cambridge energy research associates a u s oil industry consulting firm says mr chavezs move represents "a return to another era the s " when it was commonplace for developing nations to own utilities and energy companies and manage them inefficiently venezuelans had mixed reactions to the news nieves de marquez years old a hotel receptionist applauded mr chavezs move "ive always criticized cantvs high pricing they also fired a lot of people when they privatized the company and some never got their severance " but others remembered the days when the government managed the phone company phone lines were hard to come by and service was lousy it sometimes took less time to drive across town to talk to an acquaintance than to get a dial tone analysts worry that mr chavez isnt finished and will use his latest inauguration tomorrow to announce new measures including increasing the governments role over private education last week he tapped his brother adan the former venezuelan envoy to havana as education minister in caracas jose barcia an economist for metroeconomica consulting firm said he expects mr chavez to make moves against other industries as well as private property such as commercial farms mr chavezs antimarket politics have spawned some imitators whom he has supported rhetorically and often with loans and subsidies in ecuador newly elected president rafael correa also wants a new constitution and a big hike in the governments take from ecuadors oil industry in nicaragua where former sandinista leader and chavez ally daniel ortega is slated to assume the presidency this week venezuelas ambassador said mr chavez planned to announce a big aid agreement on thursday which could eventually make the impoverished central american country the most important recipient of venezuelan aid outstripping bolivia and cuba but venezuelas oil riches may make it a special case when it comes to buying out big companies in bolivia president evo morales began to nationalize the countrys natural gas industry but he has struggled to carry out his plan because his impoverished country lacks money and expertise meanwhile more moderate leftist politicians such as brazils luiz inacio lula da silva and chiles michelle bachelet have ignored mr chavez attempt to turn back the clock on the free market during his speech mr chavez also suggested he would further expand the states role in the oil industry taking a harder line with major oil firms that operate in the countrys orinoco region where companies upgrade tarlike oil deposits into lighter grades of crude those include bp plc exxon mobil corp chevron corp conocophillips and total sa and statoil asa until now venezuelan oil officials have said that companies operating in the orinoco region would have to give the state at least a stake in upstream oil operations but would allow its foreign partners to maintain control of multibillion dollar upgraders that convert the tar oil yesterday mr chavez said the upgrading side of the business must also pass on to the state "international companies have the control and domination of the process of upgrading heavy crudes from the orinoco that should become property of the venezuelan state " he said but so far mr chavezs power grabs have weakened the venezuelan oil industry once the pride of this nation he ended a tradition of allowing state run oil company petroleos de venezuela sa to run itself like a professional company rather than a source of government patronage and sinecures mr chavez has used the firm to fund numerous social programs that have left the company short on investment as a result oil output has fallen sharply leaving the country vulnerable to a downturn in prices mr chavezs free spending may ultimately undermine his expansion plans some analysts say that if the price of oil drops well below &# a barrel venezuela could have a harder time paying its domestic and international commitments already the countrys policies last year generated inflation venezuelas move is unlikely to rattle investors in other developing countries say market watchers "luckily chavez is one of a kind " says don hanna head of emerging market economic analysis at citigroup in new york mr hanna says he doesnt think venezuelas nationalization moves have any ramifications for the larger markets in the region such as brazil and mexico fund managers say that there could be some impact on countries viewed as aligned with mr chavezs economic philosophy such as bolivia and to a lesser degree ecuador venezuelas nationalizations could push businesspeople or multinationals to reconsider their investments in those countries says carlos asilis a portfolio manager at vega plus capital partners in miami sara
