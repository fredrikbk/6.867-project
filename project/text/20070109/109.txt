skies may darken for insurers investors face risks as rising competition erodes premiums the risk business is getting a little riskier for insurance company shareholders in coming weeks property casualty insurers are expected to report record profits for but their ample cash and the rising competition it fosters are pushing down premiums that often is a sign profits for the most aggressive players could take a hit down the road and is a red flag for investors who are exposed to this risk if they own some property casualty specialists worrying about property casualty insurance stocks today might seem like toting an umbrella on a cloudless day thanks to low disaster claims insurers are expected to post their best underwriting results in nearly years and have an estimated record &# billion set aside to pay claims according to the insurance information institute a trade group by changing policy terms insurers can take on less risk while charging lower premiums overall property casualty insurers earned nearly &# billion in profit through the first nine months of last year according to the institute that is more than those companies earned in all of which was itself a record setting year the trade group projects property casualty insurers profit for all of will be roughly &# billion meanwhile the dow jones wilshire global reinsurance stock index jumped and the dow jones wilshire global insurance index was up in the second half of last year compared with for the dow jones industrial average scratch the surface of those heady gains however and investors will find some worries last years sky high profits were mainly driven by the soaring cost of coastal natural catastrophe coverage after hurricane katrina in and the dearth of major storms in while premiums charged for that coverage are still high competition is steadily lowering rates in other important lines of coverage like corporate directors and officers liability policies or workers compensation some insurers flush with cash and hungry for growth might charge too little for coverage to win customers if future year claims come in higher than expected and exceed the premiums collected shareholders of property casualty insurers could pay dearly when companies report fourth quarter results over the next two months premium rates are worth watching typically "when the pricing cycle is starting to soften that is a sell signal " says william hawkins an insurance stock analyst with keefe bruyette &amp woods ltd in london also the combination of high profits low predicted sales growth and the lure of achieving global scale could be a recipe for insurers to strike deals adding risk premiums tend to rise and fall in cycles often determined as much or more by the supply of capital as by the actual risks insurers take on the last down cycle illustrates how price wars can sap earnings industry profits peaked in and dropped a total of over the next three years according to insurance services office inc which provides data and services that help classify and evaluate risk prices fell and claims rose significantly during that period partly in response to those circumstances and partly because of losses associated with the sept terrorist attacks in the u s and other factors prices climbed earlier this decade amid this upswing insurers preached a new focus on disciplined underwriting to avoid the boom to bust cycles of the past "when youve gone through a bad period you do behave in a more conservative fashion " says william berkley chief executive of w r berkley corp a greenwich conn insurer some insurers though may be starting to revert to old ways they are still charging higher premiums for catastrophe reinsurance coverage in peak zones like the gulf coast but in the pivotal january renewal season premiums in lines of reinsurance that are less directly tied to natural disasters are off between and from a year ago according to insurance brokers willis group holdings ltd and aon corp primary insurance rates have fallen even further in many lines of coverage if that trend continues it could pull reinsurance rates down further or pressure insurers to write more favorable terms into contracts one hint that an insurance company may be charging too little is if premium revenue rises amid an industrywide price decline "that has historically been a warning sign " says david small an insurance industry analyst at bear stearns cos smaller players or bigger companies could seek to build market share by cutting prices for a broad view of pricing trends investors might pay close attention to commentary from big insurers and reinsurers like american international group inc allianz se and swiss reinsurance co to be sure the boom to bust cycle could be gentler this time around because of several factors lower claims activity and recent corporate cost cutting might dull the pain of lower premiums insurers might be softening the risks in contract terms in return for lowering prices too meanwhile bonds low yields limit the temptation of writing scads of business to reap big rewards on invested premiums and in some cases lower premium prices also reflect a decline in real world risks a range of factors from safer cars to changes in the legal system governing tort claims have decreased the danger of future losses somewhat improved research and an effort to keep more money in the bank to back up policies could do the same "i dont think the cycle will be as peaky and troughy as it has been in the past " says charlie cantlay deputy chairman of aons reinsurance unit
