m b a track ph d shortage business schools seek professors focus on academics careers and business school trends jean wyer is a seasoned recruiter at pricewaterhousecoopers but a recent headhunting request took her aback business schools were calling on her not to hire their graduates but rather to help them find accounting professors that experience showed "just how dire the shortage of accounting ph d s is becoming " says dr wyer a principal at pwc "what terrifies me as a practitioner is the possibility that some schools may decide to stop having accounting majors if they cant find enough qualified people to teach " the growing shortage of doctoral graduates from business schools is indeed worrisome the accounting field is especially feeling the supply demand pinch but other disciplines such as finance and management are suffering from a scarcity of ph d s too as they try to replace professors who are retiring or moving into corporate and consulting jobs aacsb international the accrediting organization for business schools estimates a shortage of ph d s in the u s this year that will grow to by some universities particularly public schools have cut back on ph d programs because theyre costly to operate in addition aacsb found in a survey of deans that many have limited their enrollment because of fewer qualified applicants for students the ph d shortfall means larger classes and more online content it also is pushing schools to steal professors from their competitors driving up the cost of salaries summer supplements and other benefits such as research support james thomas dean of the smeal college of business at pennsylvania state university is concerned about the spike in salaries as he tries to fill vacant positions including nine that are tenure track "if we fill all of them we will have to do some budget juggling given the salary and supplement increases dictated by the present faculty marketplace " he says "professors are becoming more nomadic as they go where the money is moving to another school may mean a increase in compensation " dr thomas who successfully countered a couple of recent raids on his accounting faculty says "merit increases summer support and endowed professorships" are becoming even more important retention tools some schools also are offering reduced teaching loads with more time for research as well as a faster route to tenure according to aacsb newly hired professors with doctorates commanded average salaries of &# in up from &# in but those are just the averages some faculty stars may fetch salaries of &# or more those fresh out of doctoral programs earned an average of &# in compared with &# in new doctoral graduates fare especially well in accounting and finance with average salaries of about &# "sooner or later the price factor will kick in and more people will view becoming a business school professor as quite attractive " says mark zupan dean of the simon graduate school of business at the university of rochester "but that hasnt happened yet " for now dr zupan is courting mid career professors who are starting families and find the quality of life and cost of living in rochester n y appealing "rookies are too mobile " he says the best short term solution appears to be enlisting more adjunct faculty from the business world while schools cant go too far in hiring faculty without doctorates and still remain accredited aacsb sees plenty of room for more business professionals it recently began promoting its professionally qualified faculty bridge program to bring new blood into the classroom the first one week bridge session last fall at the university of california at irvine attracted people with expertise in such areas as accounting marketing supply chain management information systems and real estate a second bridge program is scheduled for may at the university of southern california "the cavalry is on its way " declares john fernandes president of aacsb similarly pricewaterhousecoopers plans to create a program called pwc teaches that would put the firms partners through a short academic training program and then lend them to schools dr wyer hopes to place more than partners on about campuses teaching primarily tax and audit courses pwc also may provide financial sponsorship for employees who want to earn a ph d themselves and teach accounting full time while many managers certainly are interested in academia especially as they approach retirement business school deans are cautious george daly dean of the mcdonough school of business at georgetown university is recruiting more nontenure track faculty from companies often with m b a rather than ph d credentials but he is careful to hire people who are "thoughtful and reflective" and can do more than just relate "war stories" from the corporate battlefield penn states dr thomas says he receives at least one query a week from executives who are nearing retirement or itching for a career change "but they forget that engaging a large group of students isnt something everyone can do " he says "i advise them to try their hand at a local community college or even high school before they waltz into a top university "
