among the paris attractions are photographs worth a detour to see paris curators seldom jet to paris anymore to sample the latest fashions in contemporary art germany and britain long ago supplanted france as youthful trend setters of bravado and outrage in europe the city hosts a couple of well attended international art fairs and is still home or second home to major figures in painting sculpture and photography but the native intellectual class expends far more passion writing about art than making it french collectors would rather erect a monument to a dead artist than buy unsanctioned works by a living one this arrangement is convenient for foreign visitors in many french museums one can take shelter from the overheated climate of speculation fostered now by galleries in new york los angeles and london several historical exhibitions up at the moment in paris attest to the money and thought commonly devoted by the french to the presentation of art their own and others the citys artistic energy may be lagging but the tradition of respect for artists is not the maurice denis retrospective at the musee dorsay is well installed and something of a revelation alas what it reveals is that denis was on the whole a pious bore as an energetic journalist in late th and early th century paris he coined one of the most quoted phrases in art history "remember that a picture before being a war horse a nude an anecdote or whatever is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order " his critical polemics helped to win the day for the symbolists the nabis a group that included himself bonnard and vuillard the fauves and the cubists his gifts were less apparent however when he picked up a brush or camera languorous neo classical angels and other christian figures slowly parade here in room after room a wan monotone of religiosity more decorative than fervent several of his designs for entire rooms have been reconstructed including a cycle on the myth of psyche that was brought to paris from the hermitage but deniss color lacks the vivifying purity of matisses and his scenes of domestic life the museum has a separate exhibition of his photographs never transcend their sentimental origins the show closes on jan and wont be coming to the u s two small photography exhibitions deserve to cross the ocean "la photographie humaniste " at the old bibliotheque nationale on rue richelieu traces how the work of postwar french photographers was used by the tourism board to restore the countrys humiliated self image and promote in the words of curators dominique versavel laure beaumont maillet and francoise denoyelle "a national iconography based on nostalgia and optimism " reproductions of images were key as exhibitions of original prints were almost unheard of in those years to accompany photographs by wily ronis brassai robert doisneau and many lesser known figures the show features brief and wonderful films by agnes varda joris ivens and jacques prevert but most prominently magazines calendars posters and advertisements these vehicles tend to portray happy workers in the vineyards laughing children fashion models posed at the cafe deux magots glamorous paris numinous paris and especially romantic paris much of the work dates from the s and coincides with the cheerful mood of international cooperation seen in the "family of man " the landmark exhibition at the museum of modern art that brought together photographs from around the world the global reach of the medium derives in no small part from the ability of other technologies to clone its images in various dimensions it is instructive to see here that doisneaus "kiss " his staged shot of a young couple smooching in front of the hotel de ville was originally a tiny reproduction one of six pictures on a two page spread in a issue of life magazine only much later after being transferred to postcards that were plucked off racks by countless tourists did it become a photographic cliche the show ends jan and is worth a detour "regarder vu " at the maison europeene de la photographie in the marais is equally outstanding and can be visited until feb photography historian michel frizot has surveyed the extraordinary publishing history of vu a magazine that during its lifetime until the nazi invasion in set the pace for general interest news weeklies around the world under editor lucien vogel and art director alexander liberman who later held this title for decades at conde nast in new york vu was esteemed for its dynamic layouts and photographs andre kertesz man ray and henri cartier bresson were among its free lancers a promotional silent film from about daily life at the magazine women in cloche hats and furs offer their prints to the debonair vogel for his approval opens the show other rooms present small cameras and wire service machines from the time wall panels on the history of rotogravure examine the process by which the magazine printed images in a sumptuous tonal range of browns and blues but the highlights are the sample stories from the more than issues that made up vu even without english translations one can share its graphic pleasures and excitement vogel was a committed leftist and got himself fired for supporting the spanish republic in he sounded the alarm about the rise of hitler in the pages of his magazine in the late s one room in the show exhibits the more than stories vu published about the nazis including a map of concentration camps in still it also had to please advertisers and a wide readership vu published more features about sports fashion travel animals food and celebrities than about politics mr frizot is candid about such discrepancies other histories have dwelled almost exclusively on vogels anti fascism while reminding us of the editors courage and innovations i cant recall seeing a better show about the vitality and inevitable compromises of mass circulation magazines in a democracy mr woodward is an arts critic in new york
