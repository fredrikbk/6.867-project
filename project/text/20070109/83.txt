options expand for crohns disease patients drugs on market and in trials show promise in treatment surgery gets new attention after decades of relying on little more than steroids victims of a painful digestive disease are starting to see a wider range of treatment options from new drugs to promising surgical techniques crohns disease a debilitating and incurable digestive ailment affects about one million people world wide a fold increase since world war ii by some estimates which doctors speculate is due to a confluence of environment and genetics crohns is an immune disorder that causes inflammation deep in the lining of the digestive tract symptoms generally start in adolescent patients as stomach cramping and diarrhea but can result in an inability to digest food leading even to death from malnutrition patients have largely been treated with steroids which are powerful suppressants of the immune system but these drugs can produce an array of side effects including rashes weight gain and osteoporosis other drugs such as methotrexate have run into problems with efficacy and side effects surgery to remove sections of diseased intestine has been another option but that can leave the digestive tract so short that it can no longer easily absorb nutrients the latest major advancement is a category of drugs called anti tnf medicines the drugs target a compound known as tumor necrosis factor which is overproduced in many patients with inflammatory disease so far most of these medicines are approved mainly for rheumatoid arthritis though they can be used "off label" for crohns only johnson &amp johnsons anti tnf drug remicade is approved by the food and drug administration specifically to treat crohns some patients develop a resistance to remicade because its made in part from mouse cells which the human body may reject doctors say a spokesman for johnson &amp johnson says that any time a foreign protein is injected into the human body it can elicit an allergic response the drug also requires a trip to the hospital every eight weeks for an intravenous infusion other anti tnfs hold the promise of being more convenient and better tolerated says jonathan braun a professor at uclas medical school still anti tnfs dont work for everyone can come with increased risk of infection and blood cancer and are costly often over &# a month "the anti tnfs have revolutionized care for patients but theyre not a magic bullet for everyone " says warren strober chief of the mucosal immunity section of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases heres a look at whats on the horizon for crohns patients new access to existing drugs the anti tnf category has been a huge growth driver for drug makers credit suisse equity research estimates that the world wide market for biologic auto immune medicines which includes mostly anti tnfs will grow to &# billion in from &# billion in a cowen &amp co report estimated j&amp js revenue alone from remicade in crohns and a related condition ulcerative colitis was &# million last year recently there has been progress getting more anti tnf drugs to crohns patients remicade was approved in may for crohns in children humira abbott laboratories blockbuster anti tnf medicine for rheumatoid arthritis has been accepted for a "fast track" fda review for crohns which means it could be available in the first half of the year humira is injected with a syringe rather than infused intravenously and patients can administer the shot themselves at home every two weeks humira which is completely made out of human cells could also provoke less resistance in patients than other therapies ginger gray a year old housewife from westtown pa who was diagnosed with crohns about years ago is one patient who got well on remicade and then developed a resistance to it already she had spent almost years on steroids which she says gave her cataracts and a "moon face that made me look like charlie brown" and had five surgeries lately her doctor has prescribed humira off label which has driven her disease into remission for now "im hopeful with all the research going on that i wont have to stay on humira " she says she worries that "you are fooling around with your immune system " besides anti tnfs there is a rheumatoid arthritis drug from bristol myers squibb called orencia that is being studied for crohns disease the drug works on inflammation earlier in the process than do anti tnfs bristol started the final phase of human testing of orencia against crohns last month and is currently enrolling patients in a trial tysabri a multiple sclerosis drug co marketed in the u s by elan pharmaceuticals inc and biogen idec inc has demonstrated effectiveness against crohns especially in the half of patients who dont respond to the anti tnf drugs according to elan but tysabri was withdrawn from the market in after it was tied to a rare brain infection it was reinstated last summer with tightened restrictions on prescribing the companies are still pursuing fda approval for crohns and submitted the drug for consideration last month lars ekman elans president of global research and development says the brain infection occurs in about one in patients and that other medicines for crohns also have side effects drugs in the pipeline j&amp j and abbott are working on drugs that inhibit two proteins called interleukin and interleukin both companies are in the middle stages of human testing dr strober of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases says the benefit could be tackling inflammation much earlier in its development than the anti tnfs do but that the drugs could carry an increased risk of infection belgiums ucb sa filed last year with the fda for approval of its new anti tnf drug cimzia for crohns and the fda recently responded asking the company for additional clarification cimzia is a once a month shot which patients will have to go to the doctor to get at first cimzia is made with human cells and may also provoke less resistance osiris therapeutics based in baltimore just got approval from the fda to go into the third and final phase of human testing on a crohns drug that uses adult stem cells the company says the agency gave the drug fast track status which means it could come to market as early as the drug is thought to work by correcting inflammation only where its taking place which could help avoid excessive immune suppression surgery for patients whose disease requires surgery a new bowel sparing procedure for advanced crohns is gaining attention the surgical technique developed by fabrizio michelassi chief surgeon at new york presbyterian hospital weill cornell medical center has been shown to restore function of the bowel in an article last month in the journal diseases of the colon &amp rectum dr michelassi found that the procedure is being reproduced with good results by other surgeons instead of cutting out narrowed portions of the bowel and shortening the gut the new procedure creates a new enlarged intestinal passageway allowing nutrients to be absorbed again further research is being conducted by dr michelassi to confirm that the disease disappears after the procedure menu of choices treatments for crohns disease steroids reduce inflammation but carry side effects anti tnf drugs target part of the inflammatory process but arent effective in all patients experimental medications a number of drugs that target the disease in different ways are in clinical trials
