the daily fix in finale a long time coming flawless florida shows its no college football is the only major sport that lets more than a month elapse and a calendar year turn before its championship game and after the participants penultimate contest that separation makes the annual bowl games a season unto themselves and for this new season an entirely new florida gators team showed up last night to roll over undefeated ohio state and claim the polls no ranking these new gators brushed aside ohio states opening touchdown on a kickoff the next was all florida much maligned quarterback chris leak passed for yards and a touchdown his counterpart at ohio state heisman trophy winner troy smith passed for just yards and turned the ball over twice the buckeyes gained just yards all game they had more than that by the end of the first quarter of each of their past seven games "i gained more than yards just walking in from the parking lot " zings los angeles times columnist bill plaschke in their prior game the buckeyes yielded points to no michigan otherwise no one had scored more than points against them all season until the gators rolled for more points than they had scored against any other div i a opponent except hapless central florida "it felt like watching a season opener more than a championship game " michael wilbon writes in the washington post the victorious gators werent expected to win the championship when their regular season ended but then neither were most other major sports reigning champions the gators gainesville fla counterparts in mens basketball making florida the only school to hold both titles simultaneously the pittsburgh steelers the st louis cardinals and the miami heat but those other teams coalesced and improved gradually on a public stage against multiple opponents over several weeks or months thats called a "playoff " for those college football fans who might be unfamiliar with the concept floridas metamorphosis was private taking place over days on practice fields in coach urban meyers lab of football trickery and in the minds and bodies of players dedicated to exceeding their inconsistent record in since december when florida last took the field against a live opponent and two weeks after ohio states last game a lot has happened in sports carmelo anthony scored points threw a punch and sat out games of his game suspension the dallas mavericks started and ended a game winning streak the new york giants lost four times and florida beat ohio state by points in mens basketball the football team did better by one point that helps explain how a florida team whose last six games against div i a opponents featured a loss and five wins by an average of points four of them against unranked teams wound up mercifully draining the clock with more than seven minutes left against an ohio state team that had beaten two no teams and won all but two of its games by points or more during college footballs layoff of a month or more teams can rust heal draw up new plays and gather motivation from the point spread and press predictions so an upset in college footballs final game the mythical sort of kinda a little bit of a national title game as deadspin calls it is no upset seven of nine underdogs have triumphed since college football adopted a system to match up nos and in the season finale ohio state itself did as much against miami in but no team has re invented itself like florida did it was such a departure from the regular season stewart mandel writes on si com "that it leaves us wondering whether the past four months were really just one big lie " nonsense several columnists say the outcome was inevitable given the southeastern conferences superior speed and overall talent "theres no other recourse than admitting that ohio state and michigan were nothing more than paper tigers pumping up their records and reputations on embarrassingly flawed conference competition " drew sharp writes in the detroit free press a week after michigan which had agitated for a rematch against ohio state last night was soundly beaten by usc in the rose bowl but that embarrassingly flawed conference competition acquitted itself well in bowl games with wisconsin and penn state both beating ranked sec teams theres no question that floridas defensive line was faster than the buckeyes offensive line as si coms luke winn emphasizes but that doesnt explain dominance in every other facet of the game to the fix this was the case of a team playing on a transcendent level against a rusty suddenly shaky opponent when florida kicker chris hetland of on field goal attempts coming into the game nailed his second yarder in two tries florida fans had to be thinking "it really is our night " writes boston globe columnist bob ryan who a couple of months ago said on espn that troops should prevent florida from entering university of phoenix stadium if the gators were chosen to play ohio state ohio state meanwhile was hurt by the early loss of return man and wideout ted ginn jr to a sprained left foot suffered while celebrating that opening touchdown "in the stands his dad ted ginn sr was in tears " tom archdeacon writes in the dayton daily news "it was strictly parental concern but as a football coach himself he also knew how damaged ohio states chances now were " the football coach on the florida sideline year old urban meyer gets deserved plaudits in todays papers for his creative play calling and his teams flawless execution "meyer is an all purpose wonder " jon saraceno writes in usa today "in a profession with many bright minds he is beginning to separate himself and blindingly so " with unfilled high profile nfl coaching vacancies in miami and pittsburgh and the new york media hungry for another one with the giants kansas city star columnist jason whitlock and the new york posts mike vaccaro are nominating mr meyer for a jump to the pros mr leak may also make the leap to the nfl if his performance last night convinced an nfl team to use a late round pick on the four year starter whose "whirlwind career " as msnbcs joey johnston calls it culminated in the ultimate triumph without mr leak and as many as defensive starters florida will contend next year but usc will be the favorites writes si coms mr mandel doing fix double duty usc isnt yet done thinking about it could have been the trojans routing ohio state instead of its big rival michigan if theyd avoided a stunning season ending upset at the hands of ucla "turns out whoever played ohio state last night was going to be champions " paul oberjuerge writes in the los angeles daily news "getting here was the key " and if usc had beaten ucla we never would have known how good florida could be thats because college football still doesnt have a playoff but instead a layoff as dan bickley laments in the arizona republic that will persist as long as the big and pac continue to resist the idea and playoff hungry fans nonetheless keep watching the bowl games ray melick explains in the birmingham news thus boise state the nations only undefeated team finished no higher than no in the polls though one brave associated press voter had them at no would coach meyer who got the florida job by leading another college football outsider utah to an undefeated season and bowl victory two years ago play the broncos "lets go play em next week " he teased after the game "no i know boise state i love boise state we dont want to go play them were done were done were finished " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the daily fix
