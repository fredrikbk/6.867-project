the doctors office a first hand view on the issues facing physicians today i stopped seeing drug sales reps and had more time for patients a couple of years ago i did something a little unusual i stopped seeing drug company sales representatives my main concern was the time sap my patients didnt like to wait while i talked to drug company reps family medicine is a complex low margin business with high overhead and a huge personal time commitment i couldnt afford to run behind schedule or the loss of revenue during my office hours seeing drug company reps it could be as many as six on a busy day has been replaced with one to two additional patient visits adding an estimated &# in annual profit the perception among the general public is that drug companies give doctors a lot of free stuff that influences their prescribing habits the halcyon days of doctor goodies were way before my time the freebies arent all that great anymore and meal opportunities are limited still i didnt want to fuel the perception of influence by making my office an unofficial billboard for the pharmaceutical industry my partner still sees drug reps so some promotional material finds its way in the common areas of our office and while ive lost a few pounds from missing the lunches i occasionally slip to the culinary dark side and listen and nosh or eat leftovers from the visits to her but i now carry my own generic looking black pens one concern of mine was that i would have fewer samples especially for my lower income patients but sample medications arent as useful to me as they once were the samples are often for expensive new medications that may not have good formulary coverage or may have layers of preauthorization before i can prescribe them even if the patient gets a good response from a sampled drug they often cant afford to continue on it as for information about new drugs ive got plenty online i monitor multiple sources of breaking news on drug therapy i get newsletters from sources i trust rather than employ a host of people to make sales calls or bring lunch for my staff id like the industry to put their educational programs online and make a charitable donation each time i view new material that sounds better than lunch any day benjamin brewer runs a family medicine practice in forrest ill and is a columnist for wsj com find his columns at wsj com health join a discussion about drug reps with dr brewer and readers at wsj com forums
