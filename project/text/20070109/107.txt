same crowd behind oil rise now sells out large investors got in find rollover costs too high to stay on crude oils run last year to close to &# a barrel drew cries that bullish investors were creating a commodity price bubble now it looks like some of the same investors could be accentuating crudes downward slide the appeal of holding oil as an investment has changed oil itself is losing value crude oil futures yesterday closed at &# down from a july peak on the new york mercantile exchange mainly as mild winter weather reduced heating demand moreover investors are finding it costs a significant amount of money to keep skin in the game in the oil futures markets during the decline unlike the stock market even if crude goes nowhere in investors employing a buy and hold strategy will actually lose money because of the heavy costs of holding oil futures investments "a lot of people came into the start of the year expecting funds and investors to continue putting more money into crude and continue buying commodity futures " says ben dell at research firm sanford c bernstein &amp co but he adds "if youre losing money month in and month out you probably dont want to own it " oil futures contracts expire every month investors holding the most current contracts have to buy new ones to replace them if they want to maintain their positions in the past couple of years in part because of the influx of financial investors making long range bets these contracts have gotten pricier the further into the future they are scheduled to be delivered something known as contango that raises the cost of keeping a position in the market its almost like the difference between walking a mile and walking a mile uphill about two years ago spot prices of crude were higher than future months something known as backwardation which boosted investors returns every month in practical terms for most investors with oil in their portfolio the cost of rolling over the expiring near month futures contract into the one for the next months delivery is now more than &# a barrel the price of oil could be unchanged at &# per barrel and an investor would still lose because of these costs the current pain shows up in the goldman sachs commodity index it has a roughly allocation to energy futures and fell in thanks in part to the heavy cost of rolling over crude futures contracts by contrast funds linked to the dow jones aig commodity index which has only about a energy weighting made last year other commodity futures contracts currently arent as expensive to roll over as oil this is affecting large institutional investors such as pension funds which have been pouring into commodities in recent years seeking to diversify their portfolios a few years ago they were happy to pay the "roll cost" to hold oil because its price was rising and canceled out carrying costs in the futures markets from to according to bernstein research investments linked to broad based commodity market indexes jumped from roughly &# billion to &# billion with about half of that increase pouring into the energy markets but oils recent slide has given many investors the jitters crude oil fell in the first two trading days of and ended last week down oil fell cents a barrel yesterday to its &# close on the nymex nobody is predicting an end to investors interest in commodities as a way to diversify their portfolios the california public employees retirement system or calpers approved a pilot program this past fall to invest directly in commodities futures markets and it is one of a growing number of pension funds planning to devote a much larger allocation to the sector but these investors also may seek to adjust their allocations to indexes that are less energy focused than say the goldman index because roughly &# billion is invested in funds linked to the goldman index pulling out or switching allocations rapidly could cause further downward pressure on the oil markets some traders and economists say "all the energy centric indices did not do well in as a result one could expect less money to flow into energy heavy indices this year " says harry arora head of arcim advisors a commodities focused hedge fund in cos cob conn rollover costs are "eating up the returns for the index guy " meanwhile another big question mark is hanging over the market rising inventories global storage statistics are widely open to debate and experts disagree on how full inventories are because a lot of it is controlled by governments and oil refiners and producers but a report published last month by bernstein attempted to quantify just how full storage is in independent commercially operated storage terminals that traders can use the research firms answer as of december is full up from months ago and around in in pockets of the world where storage is especially full supplies could flood the market and depress prices bernstein analysts contend a different set of financial speculators including hedge funds and trading firms that buy and sell physical barrels of oil have been investing heavily in crude inventories because of the futures market phenomenon these speculators enter a contract to sell oil months or years into the future then they fill their tanks with oil that they buy more cheaply on the open market the difference between oil delivered next month and that for august delivery for example is roughly &# a barrel these speculators pay a few dollars for storage but still pocket a few dollars a barrel in profit some economists think this strategy could unravel should storage facilities fill up philip verleger an independent energy economist who heads pk verleger llc has warned that oil markets could collapse from excess inventory coming on the market and index investors pulling back from oil due to the unattractive economics of holding it bhushan bahree contributed to this article
