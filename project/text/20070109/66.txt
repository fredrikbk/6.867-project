in the fray why the yankees traded randy johnson theres an old adage in sports that says you cant replace a superstar this season the new york yankees are going against that wisdom in a big way theyre going to replace two superstars last november the yankees dealt superstar slugger gary sheffield to the detroit tigers for three relative unknowns last week they shipped left hander randy johnson to the arizona diamondbacks for four players who most yankee fans to judge from the internet and radio call in shows have never heard of how many are demanding to know can the yankees hope to win by letting two erstwhile all stars go in favor of a bunch of guys who might not be on the roster in a couple of years on the surface at least the question is legitimate none of the players the yankees have acquired have reached the level of star let alone superstar and both messrs sheffield and johnson have bona fide cooperstown credentials mr sheffield a veteran of big league seasons has career home runs and eight seasons with more than or more runs batted in mr johnsons statistics are even more hall of fame worthy a won lost record for and an amazing five cy young awards most analysts rank him along with sandy koufax as one of the two best left handed starting pitchers of the past years but steven goldman who writes the pinstripe bible for the yes network and edits the baseball prospectus annual thinks the yankees have finally begun to address their team weaknesses "with intelligence instead of just money over the last few seasons the yankees have won the eastern division but always come up one or two players short in the postseason these deals are an attempt to find those one or two players " for one thing mr goldman notes "the yankees are easing the age factor that was accumulating on their roster " mr sheffield though he looks to have a couple of productive years ahead as a hitter is and has become a defensive liability in the outfield particularly since the yankees picked up the more than capable bobby abreu that would have left mr sheffields primary role as designated hitter where the yankees already have several candidates most notably jason giambi in any event the yankees won the american league east last year mostly without the services of mr sheffield who appeared in just games last year due to injury quantifying randy johnsons loss is trickier in casey stengel when informed by the yankees front office that one of his starters had been traded and that he probably wouldnt miss him all that much replied "ok just make sure you find me another guy who can win games " in the current yankees case that will be games which is what mr johnson won in each of his two seasons in the bronx though he never quite matched the level of his cy young winning seasons his wins wont be easily replaced still the big units departure may well be a case of addition by subtraction clearly mr johnson who will celebrate his th birthday before the end of this coming season is a pitcher in decline his strikeout total one of the quickest measures of a pitchers effectiveness has dropped from to to over the past three years though his win total doesnt reflect it his durability and effectiveness were off sharply from previous years in with the arizona diamondbacks he pitched innings in starts for an average of seven innings per start in with the yankees he pitched innings in starts for an average of innings per outing last season he was down to an average of less than with innings in starts "the wins " says allen st john who writes the by the numbers column for the journal "gives a false impression of johnsons value for one thing he had terrific run support from yankee hitters for another he was one of the primary culprits along with jaret wright in wearing out the yankees bullpen " mr wright who had a respectable win loss record of was even more ineffective than mr johnson starting games and lasting just innings for an average of less than last november the yankees traded mr wright to the baltimore orioles "people look at johnsons and wrights won lost records and see a record of and say hey thats not bad what they dont see is the down side which is all the innings that had to be thrown by other pitchers because those two could scarcely pitch the sixth inning " most yankee observers feel that the failure of the bullpen is the main reason the yankees have been unable to win a world series since and that the failure of the relief corps is largely due to their being worn down over the course of the regular season by overuse the replacement of messrs johnson and wright in the rotation by andy pettitte and kei igawa goes a long ways toward bolstering the yankees staff from the starters end as for the bullpen several younger stronger arms picked up in the three trades ought to make a significant difference the three relievers most likely to make an impact luis vizcaino chris britton and humberto sanchez are respectively age and none of them are as well known as the players they are replacing and they may never be but theres a good chance yankee fans will know them by world series time mr barra writes about sports for the journal
