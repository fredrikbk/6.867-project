big three seek battery subsidies larger u s outlay would speed work on electric vehicles detroit the big three auto makers have asked the federal government to spend roughly &# million over five years to subsidize the development of advanced batteries required to power future vehicles such as the electric prototype generating buzz for general motors corp in a follow up to a november meeting between president bush and their chief executives gm ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group last month submitted a white paper to a white house technology adviser saying the u s is trailing japan in development of batteries for fuel efficient automobiles and could suffer economically if the government doesnt help accelerate domestic research efforts in this area company officials said the proposal is being reviewed by a technology advisor to mr bush and the department of energy said scott w schramm daimlerchryslers manager for regulatory and technical affairs spokesmen for the white house and the energy department couldnt comment yesterday afternoon the detroit auto makers are worried they could be locked out of a key component for future vehicles if japan maintains its lead in developing high powered lightweight batteries needed for gasoline electric hybrids and pure electric vehicles their request also underscores the longer term competitive difficulties their financial troubles are causing all three are losing money in north america gm and ford are both expected to report losses for chrysler had an operating loss of &# billion but parent daimlerchrysler remained profitable in contrast toyota motor corp has billions to pour into new technologies and fund development projects with myriad suppliers mr schramm said chrysler ford and gm havent always been able to get the technical help they would like from japanese suppliers that have been developing the lithium ion batteries that auto makers think will be light enough and inexpensive enough for next generation vehicles "theres not a lot of sharing of information about prototype batteries weve had some difficulties even getting prototypes " mr schramm said the u s he added is "behind on this " in toyota obtained a majority stake in a leading battery maker panasonic ev energy co that was widely seen as a way to tighten the auto makers control over the supply of batteries for its prius hybrid the move effectively gave toyota power over whom panasonic ev does business with at the north american international auto show in detroit gm unveiled the chevrolet volt a prototype of a battery powered vehicle that appears to be a step ahead of the hybrids on the market the volt has an onboard engine that generates electricity once its batteries run down and owners would be able to recharge the car by plugging it in to an electrical outlet hybrids use a battery powered motor in stop and go driving and use an internal combustion engine for acceleration and higher speeds the volt should get about miles per gallon for short commutes gm estimated gm officials promised the company would produce a drivable version of the volt later this year but said it probably cant commercialize the vehicle without government help in developing batteries "we are not battery experts " said elizabeth a lowery gm vice president for environment and energy last week gm contracted with two u s suppliers saft advanced power solutions llc and cobasys to develop lithium ion batteries for a future plug in version of the saturn vue hybrid sports utility vehicle ms lowery and mr schramm rejected suggestions their companies were looking for government help on the kind of development efforts the industry should fund on its own in the proposal sent to the white house the big three said developing advanced batteries is critical for the u s to produce the kinds of fuel efficient vehicles that will help reduce greenhouse emissions and dependence on foreign oil to produce electric cars in large volumes gm "would like to have a domestic battery supplier and have the technical expertise in the u s " ms lowry said mr schramm said the federal government is already supposed to spend about &# million this year to support battery development the recent proposal from the big three suggested a five year plan with an expenditure of up to &# million in the first year rising to up to &# million in the final years of the effort john j fialka in washington contributed to this article
