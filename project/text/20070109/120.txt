up for the e mail here oil prices fell again this morning despite yet more volatility in some of the most important petroleum producing regions oil for february delivery was down as much as &# or at &# on the new york mercantile exchange and its now down about from the record price of &# reached july as bloomberg notes ali jarrah al sabah the kuwaiti oil minister said opec members may even cancel plans to expand production capacity if the trend continues because "falling prices will damage our economies " but its far from clear whether such a threat would be carried out or which members would do so especially since saudi arabia opecs biggest producer has apparently considered additional production capacity as a potential means to weaken iran the acceleration of oils price ascent essentially began in mid when the effects of chinas unquenchable petroleum thirst began to become apparent at the same time as the u s economy began to recover geopolitical developments across the mideast and other oil producing regions from the aftermath of the iraq invasion to terror attacks in saudi arabia and resurgent militancy among autonomy seeking nigerians on that countrys oil coast helped fuel the growth of prices but as the wall street journal notes the oil market seemed to feed on itself as bullish investors contributed to a commodity price bubble but now the journal says "it looks like some of the same investors could be accentuating crudes downward slide " pulling out of the market rather than paying what might be a heft price for staying in the recent price declines due in part to unseasonably warm weather in the northern hemisphere plays a part in that dynamic still the original supply and demand equation hasnt seemed to loosen much yet and as events yesterday demonstrated there are still worrisome question marks on the supply side the once thick as thieves governments of russia and belarus are holding negotiations today aimed at resolving their bitter feud over the russian oil that passes through the small former soviet state on its way to western europe yesterday moscow halted those exports and accused minsk of stealing oil from a pipeline that carries some of russian oil on its way to europe this follows the end of the year dispute over natural gas that led to a big increase in the price charged to belarus and senior russian officials tell the financial times the belarusian oil moves "smelled of a trade war " the international energy agency said today that affected member countries germany hungary and the czech republic and applicant countries poland and slovakia have enough strategic reserves to counter the immediate threat but the ft notes the "shutdown is the latest interruption of russian energy supplies to europe and could further dent russias reputation as a reliable supplier of energy after last years gas supply stand off between russia and ukraine " on the other side of the atlantic venezuelan president hugo chavez announced the state takeover of four major foreign controlled oil production facilities as well as nationalization of the countrys biggest telecommunications and electricity businesses which are both controlled by u s firms the state owned petroleos de venezuela already dominates the industry there and assuming control of previously foreign owned projects these latest moves "would accelerate the pace of chavezs pledged socialist transformation of venezuela the eighth largest exporter of crude oil worldwide and the fourth largest foreign supplier to the united states " the los angeles times notes mr chavez also pledged to get rid of venezuelas commercial code and whats left of the central banks autonomy the journal adds but the petroleum strategies of mr chavez and the kremlin could be eclipsed on the scale of volatility by brewing antagonism in the middle east over iraq as president bush gets ready to roll out his latest strategy for the war the u s s arab allies "are worried about what might happen if the plan fails that worsening strife could engulf the entire region sparking a wider war in the middle of the worlds largest oil patch " as the journal reports these fears arent new but the potential for a sunni shiite conflict with iran and shiite iraq on one side and the saudis and most other neighboring states on the other is now being described by regional diplomats and u s officials as a "nightmare scenario" that now appears more plausible the journal says if nothing else this adds a lot of uncertainty about the future of oil prices gearing up for the new iraq strategy president bush yesterday brought republican senators to the white house as the first step in the campaign to sell his new plan and the senators said he made clear the much reported additional deployment of as many as troops to iraq will be part of it they said mr bush is optimistic that this plan will succeed thanks to what the president described as a greater willingness by iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki to commit iraqi forces to quelling the violence even when it comes from militias allied with members of his government the washington post reports but some of the republican senators expressed doubts about the plan and polls suggest many americans will too respondents to the latest usa today gallup poll opposed the idea of increased troop levels to while approval of the job mr bush is doing in iraq sank to a new low of the paper said meanwhile top u s military officials tell the los angeles times that such a buildup will require them to reverse pentagon policy and send units from the national guard and the army reserve on lengthy second tours in iraq a factor likely to prove controversial among u s governors who share authority over the guard the big
