politics &amp economics secrets stall a probe cia information is at issue a federal criminal investigation of the central intelligence agencys former third highest official has stalled because of cia reluctance to turn over classified documents requested by prosecutors people close to the investigation say the u s attorneys office in san diego has been investigating former cia executive director kyle "dusty" foggo to determine whether he committed illegal acts in influencing the awarding of cia covert contracts mr foggo resigned from the cia in may shortly after the wall street journal disclosed the investigation among the contracts under investigation is one the cia awarded to the company of a lifelong friend of mr foggos brent wilkes a california defense contractor last year former congressman randy "duke" cunningham pleaded guilty to soliciting bribes from individuals including mr wilkes the foggo inquiry is part of a chain of pending criminal investigations sparked by the cunningham case its progress is important both because of the nature of the contracts involved and because a trial may shed light on additional contracting improprieties first hinted at in the cunningham case wrangling between prosecutors and the cia isnt unusual in cases involving espionage or other criminal activity by agency employees because of the risk that important secrets could be divulged in a trial despite such difficulties prosecutors have obtained espionage and other criminal convictions of some intelligence agency personnel but no cia official who held a position as high as mr foggos has ever been prosecuted his case is sensitive because of mr foggos former top level status at the agency his knowledge of a huge range of covert activities and the fact that the investigation involves the awarding of contracts that the cia is reluctant to have disclosed the people with knowledge of the inquiry said mark j macdougall mr foggos lawyer declined to comment on details of the investigation but said "mr foggo has served his country with honor and has committed no crime and has violated no law in that service " if there is an indictment in such cases a common strategy by defense lawyers is to demand classified material they say is needed for the defense hoping that the government will refuse and the case will be dismissed so prosecutors try to work out ahead of time what information can be disclosed and sometimes tailor the specific charges to evidence only in declassified materials but prosecutors also can try to get as much evidence as possible declassified in advance in hope of persuading the accused to negotiate a guilty plea and averting a trial in which secrets might be divulged that happened with cia turncoat spy aldrich ames now serving a life sentence after he pleaded guilty in to divulging secrets to the former soviet union officials at the u s attorneys office in san diego declined to comment on the investigation though people with knowledge of it say it still appears that the declassification conflicts with the cia can be worked out but slow negotiations have substantially delayed the case prosecutors in san diego had expected to get a grand jury indictment of mr foggo some months ago the cia doesnt appear to be trying to prevent charges against mr foggo say those familiar with the investigation rather it has taken the position that the justice department can successfully complete its investigation of him without getting access to all the classified material they requested cia spokesman mark mansfield said the agency wouldnt comment "other than to emphasize that the cia has been cooperating with the department of justice in their investigation and continues to do so " jeffrey smith a former cia general counsel said the agency traditionally has been eager to help prosecutors convict agency employees who committed crimes he noted that a federal law the classified information protection act was adopted specifically to make it possible to prosecute spies and intelligence agency employees while protecting vital secrets former cia director porter goss in november named mr foggo then a mid level cia official to take on the high level post mr foggos close friendship with mr wilkes emerged in december as a result of the cunningham investigation the journal reported last spring that mr foggo attended poker games arranged by mr wilkes in washington hotel suites and that prosecutors were investigating evidence that during some of these games mr wilkes had supplied mr cunningham with prostitutes in the suites a cia spokeswoman confirmed at the time that mr foggo had been present in the hotel "hospitality suites " but said mr foggo denied that anything improper had occurred while he was there in may federal bureau of investigation and other federal agents searched mr foggos office at cia headquarters in langley va and his home days after he had announced his intention to resign while mr foggo was at the cia the agency awarded at least one contract to one of mr wilkess companies archer logistics to provide water and other supplies to cia agents in iraq and afghanistan people close to the investigation say mr wilkes paid for expensive vacations for mr foggo and his wife flying them on his corporate jet to hawaii and scotland among other places he also gave gifts to mr foggo an investigation by the cias inspector general the results of which havent been disclosed looked into the contracts and whether mr foggo as required by agency rules had informed the agency of the free trips and gifts mr wilkes hasnt been charged but remains under investigation by san diego federal prosecutors his lawyers have strongly denied that he was involved in any illegal activity a house intelligence committee document made public in the fall disclosed that mr foggo also has been under investigation for awarding contracts to the company of another individual subsequently identified as richard wenzel president of global transportation systems in sterling va the firm received "several large contracts" from the cia the document said people involved in the case say these included delivering equipment and supplies abroad making use of the companys fleet of specialized ilyushin jet cargo planes these aircraft can use makeshift runways and unload heavy cargo without requiring ground based equipment mr wenzel is aiding prosecutors and isnt a target of the investigation his lawyer james hamilton said "my client is solely a cooperating witness " dustys road a look
