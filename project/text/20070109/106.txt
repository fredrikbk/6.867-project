russian oil cutoff rouses europes doubt the sudden suspension of russian oil exports through belarus amid a dispute over fuel subsidies will exacerbate europes concerns about its dependence on its huge eastern neighbor for energy supplies russian officials yesterday said moscow had shut off crude exports through belarus in retaliation for what russian officials said was illegal siphoning by belarus of oil from the main pipeline that carries russian crude to europe the move led to a halt in deliveries to germany and poland which depend on the pipeline for the bulk of their oil supplies and sharply reduced flows to hungary slovakia and czech republic european officials said they have adequate stocks to survive any disruption and the response in oil markets was modest but moscows sudden cutoff of a vital energy conduit to the continent widened questions about russias reliability as an energy supplier a year after a dispute over the price of natural gas with neighboring ukraine briefly reduced vital russian gas shipments to europe "this shows us once again that arguments among various countries of the former soviet union between suppliers and transit countries mean that from our perspective these deliveries are unreliable " polands deputy economy minister piotr naimsky told polands tvn television "it really shakes confidence in oil and gas supply " said a person in the german administration "its very unfortunate " russia is the worlds largest exporter of natural gas and its no oil exporter after saudi arabia european union energy chief andris piebalgs demanded an "urgent and detailed explanation" from minsk and moscow though he said the cutoff poses "no immediate risk to the supply of oil to the european union " mr piebalgs said he might convene the eus oil supply group later this week to decide if countries should draw on their strategic stocks the conflict comes at a moment when energy security is back at the top of the eus agenda on wednesday the european commission the eus executive arm will publish proposals for the blocs first energy strategy to be discussed at a summit of eu leaders the affected pipeline named druzhba or friendship when it was built in the s to carry soviet crude to clients in eastern europe carries about half of russias oil exports to europe roughly million barrels a day or of european crude consumption "its really surprising that the situation has escalated as far as it has " said jeffrey woodruff an analyst at fitch ratings in london "it broadens the whole question of european energy security from being just focused on gas to including oil and gas " a belarussian delegation left minsk last evening for moscow to begin talks on the dispute which comes little more than a week after the two countries narrowly avoided a cutoff of russian natural gas shipments in a new years eve price dispute the conflict comes amid growing tensions between the two erstwhile allies and shows the depth of russian disenchantment with belarussian president alexander lukashenko whom the u s calls europes last dictator russia and belarus have for years been in talks to unify a project that russian president vladimir putin hoped would crown his presidency but moscow has watched in frustration as mr lukashenko apparently fearing a loss of power has cooled on the idea "lukashenko has shown that his interests dont coincide with ours " said mikhail margelov chairman of the international affairs committee in russias senate seeking to raise the pressure on mr lukashenko oao gazprom russias state controlled gas company demanded a doubling of the discounted rate belarus pays for russian gas moscow also said it would end duty free crude sales to belarus eliminating what russian officials said amounted to a &# billion annual subsidy to minsk belarus responded last week by imposing a new transit fee on russian crude shipments across its territory a levy moscow denounced as illegal over the weekend belarus began taking oil from the russian export line as payment russian officials said in retaliation moscow cut off shipments andrei sharonov deputy economics minister told russian television the russian state pipeline monopoly oao transneft said it is working to increase exports to europe by other routes "im sure this wont affect our reputation as a reliable energy supplier " transneft vice president sergei grigoriev said officials in germany and poland said that their countries have significant reserves of crude and face no immediate threat of fuel shortages poland has more than days of oil reserves and germany about days according to eu officials polish refiner pkn orlen sa said it is working at full capacity and could easily switch to seaborne supplies via an oil terminal at the baltic sea port of gdansk the roots of the current crisis lie in russias drive to slash energy subsidies to its neighbors and have them pay what it says are market rates for its oil and gas there are signs that drive is backfiring economically for russia though azerbaijan yesterday said it will stop exporting crude through russian pipelines in order to keep more of the fuel at home where it is needed to run power plants that had depended on russian gas imports until moscows latest price increase made those too expensive the russian news agency interfax reported
