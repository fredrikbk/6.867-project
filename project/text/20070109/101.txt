shares bought in the dark as large institutional investors increasingly use anonymous trading regulators and small investors worry about pricing disclosure a supreme court jurist once wrote that sunlight is the best disinfectant wall street though is increasingly finding it more profitable to work in the dark in the past few years large brokerage firms trading boutiques and even stock exchanges have launched or announced plans to start almost trading networks known as "dark pools " named because they attempt to put buyers and sellers together anonymously without exposing their clients orders first to the public as happens on traditional stock markets like the new york stock exchange and nasdaq stock market the pools have proliferated as big institutional investors respond to the boom in electronic trading and seek out alternatives to middlemen like floor traders they have also become more popular as stock exchanges look to increase their fees to boost profits causing some traders to search for alternatives the securities and exchange commission and others though are voicing concerns about dark pools which while only representing about of stock market activity have tripled in volume since according to consulting firm towergroup at a trading conference in september sec officials said they would increase scrutiny of dark pools including a review of how they are used by sophisticated players like hedge funds and proprietary wall street trading desks "calling them dark pools is just calling for regulation " said john a mccarthy a lawyer at a chicago trading firm who at the time worked as an associate director at the sec critics of dark pools say the rapid growth could lead to less competitive trading prices for small investors who buy and sell the old fashioned way on open markets such as the big board and nasdaq brokers are generally required to offer their clients the best available published price something that will become harder to define if dark pools grow further because shares are bought and sold in the dark and the price is only posted after the trade has been completed heres how the pools work trades are matched up with other orders on a proprietary system that outsiders cant see within seconds the trades are required to be reported publicly most are reported in a second or two investors with big positions tend to favor dark pools because they dont have to expose their trading intentions to all market participants floor trading is more transparent but players can still mask their strategies for instance a floor broker may break up an order and sell it in pieces keeping the magnitude of the trade hidden from the market dan mathisson managing director of electronic trading at credit suisse group says if wall street didnt have dark pools it would be like "asking people to play poker with the cards face up " in most dark pool trades the prices are usually slightly better than what is available in the general market dark pools typically charge higher fees than exchanges but the customer often ends up saving money when the better price is factored in dark pools started in the s as firms like investment technology group inc and instinet inc designed networks to make trading easier for big investors these players primarily pension funds mutual funds and some bigger hedge funds wanted to buy and sell big blocks of stock without pushing prices around which often happens when they make big purchases or sales on the open market something they argue can hurt a big investors overall performance for years some wall street firms have crossed orders on their own systems a practice known as internalization which now is increasingly happening in dark pools many wall street heavyweights including goldman sachs group inc credit suisse group and morgan stanley now operate dark pools as do nyfix millennium ats liquidnet holdings inc and pipeline trading systems llc still regulators are looking into dark pools "because theyre not transparent " says robert hegarty managing director at towergroup "they want to make sure the individual investor isnt disadvantaged " the concerns are twofold making sure all investors get equal access to buy and sell at the best price and linking the burgeoning number of dark trading platforms so that investors can be confident that they are getting a good price when they trade for years the big board now a unit of nyse group inc argued that brokers executing trades in their own dark pools led to less competitive prices for investors but now exchanges that are losing market share to these alternate trading venues have started moving toward their own version of dark pools launching anonymous crossing sessions throughout the day nyse has only said it will do such sessions outside of the a m p m est trading day but it is exploring expanding the sessions to regular hours the evolution in thinking reflects the big boards effort to appeal to "a wider spectrum of clients " says mike cormack an nyse executive vice president he says the individual investor is still protected by sec rules and because only a small part of the business takes place in dark pools at nasdaq dark pools known as crossing auctions are offered at the beginning and end of trading and more are being added throughout the day in the electronic sessions orders pile up anonymously and then are executed at a single price in between the best advertised bid and offer this system is appealing to investors who dont want their order displayed to the broader market
