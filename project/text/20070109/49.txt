feds no chills hopes for a rate cut inflation remains a primary concern kohn says in speech despite a recent decline in the nations underlying inflation it is "too early to relax our concerns" about price pressures a top federal reserve official said suggesting interest rate cuts arent yet on the table fed vice chairman donald kohn also warned that long term interest rates could jump if the fed fails to cut short term rates as much as the market expects or if there were a reversal in other factors holding down long term rates a recent drop in core inflation which excludes food and energy is "encouragingly consistent" with the feds forecast for a gradual decline in inflation mr kohn said in a speech to the atlanta rotary club yesterday but he cautioned against "extrapolating trends from a couple of months of data " and said some of the recent slowdown in inflation may reflect "one time influences " in particular the indirect effects of the big drop in energy costs moreover companies may be holding the line on prices to keep inventories from rising and "that restraint on pricing will dissipate" once inventories are in line with sales the remarks by mr kohn the feds most influential policy maker after chairman ben bernanke suggest little has changed in the central banks outlook since it last met in december at that meeting it kept its short term interest rate target at said its principal concern remained inflation and its main choice in coming months would be whether to raise rates or leave them unchanged since that meeting manufacturing activity and business investment have softened and inflation was reported to be low for the second month in a row that has left investors wondering whether the fed at its next meeting jan will release a "neutral" policy statement one that implies a rate increase is as likely as a rate cut the fed isnt expected to change rates at the meeting mr kohn didnt address the prospect for any change in the feds stance still his remarks suggest he continues to see higher inflation as a greater risk to the economy than weaker growth the softening in manufacturing and capital spending "is not the leading edge of general economic weakness but instead an adjustment to a sustained pace of expansion that necessarily is less rapid than that from mid to mid " he said he did however strike a note of caution on the housing market "tentative signs have begun to emerge that the housing market may be stabilizing " he said and "housing starts may be not very far from their trough " but he added "the risks around this outlook still are largely to the downside " housing prices are still high relative to their fundamental determinants such as interest rates and residential rents he said the uncertainty is magnified by the fact housing isnt weakening for the usual reason high interest rates rather he said the sector is weakening because sales and construction had risen so much and it wasnt clear why mr kohn also noted that long term rates are "relatively low " which is supporting housing he said long term rates could rise if short term rates "fail to follow the downward path currently built into market expectations " or if "term premiums" rise the term premium is the additional interest rate a lender charges for a long term loan compared with a short term one that cant be explained by expectations of fed policy fed officials believe a lower term premium while difficult to measure is the main reason long term rates are so low perhaps because of the markets increased faith in low stable inflation that is why they dont think the "inverted yield curve" or long term rates that are lower than short term ones foreshadows recession as it has in the past indeed low term premiums are one reason the fed has decided not to lower short term rates but because the reasons for the low term premium are unclear there remains the chance of a sharp reversal that could weaken the u s economy and encourage the fed to lower short term rates meanwhile a report released by the fed yesterday showed that u s consumer credit grew more strongly than expected in november as shoppers put their credit cards to heavy use consumer credit which excludes mortgage debt rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about &# billion or in november to &# trillion analysts had predicted a &# billion increase revolving credit which mainly reflects credit card financing jumped in november to &# billion nonrevolving credit mostly auto loans rose to &# trillion
