condi gets israels r e s p e c t last friday a senior delegation of u s defense officials was briefed in jerusalem by members of the knessets foreign affairs and defense committee on israels threat perceptions in the wake of last summers failed war with hezbollah the israelis warned that the syrian army is at its highest state of readiness since when the two sides clashed over lebanon they also warned that egypt is actively funneling arms to hamas in gaza the claim astonished the americans why they asked had they never been told of it through formal israeli channels ties between israel and the u s are famously friendly and as in many friendships the demands of comity often get in the way of those of frankness as in israels official reluctance to expose its peace with egypt as a sham thats a lesson secretary of state condoleezza rice might keep in mind as she plans her forthcoming mideast tour beginning later this week in jerusalem and ramallah and moving on to amman cairo riyadh and kuwait and perhaps beirut or baghdad the trip is yet another effort to rally sunni arabs on behalf of the government of iraq first of all by showing the u s intends to make a major push toward an israeli palestinian peace agreement perhaps that will impress the secretarys arab hosts but it doesnt impress the israelis who unofficially bill ms rices visit as tihzuk or "maintenance " an attitude nicely captured by a popular israeli comedy skit in which an actress playing ms rice belts out aretha franklins "respect" while a stand in for israeli foreign minister tzipi livni sings back up vocals respect of the "yes minister" kind is what ms rice can mainly expect on her visit to jerusalem sure optical diplomacy the diplomacy of being seen to try has its political uses especially when it comes to papering over differences or waiting on events but circumstances always impose limits on what diplomacy can achieve and in the case of the israeli palestinian peace process the limits are sharp in palestinian president mahmoud abbas ms rice confronts a leader who as the israeli political analyst anshel pfeffer puts it has "all the practical authority of the chicago chief of police circa " never mind the internecine killing sprees now approaching outright civil war between hamas and mr abbass ostensible partisans in fatah the real problem is that mr abbas no longer controls fatah where effective authority has devolved to local chieftains and power brokers like the suave gaza security chief mohammed dahlan on the israeli side the government of prime minister ehud olmert is probably the weakest in the countrys history in a recent poll israelis disapproved of mr olmerts job performance by a three to one margin doubt his personal integrity because of questions surrounding a shady real estate deal the rest of his government is also marinating in scandal it does not have the political capital to spare on bold diplomatic moves the larger problem for israel is strategic until ariel sharon suffered a stroke a year ago last week and for a few months thereafter israelis were broadly prepared to make significant unilateral withdrawals from the west bank not because they thought the palestinians were prepared to make peace but because they believed that israel was more secure putting its enemies on the opposite side of its borders but israels manifest vulnerability last summer in the face of hezbollahs rocket attacks coupled with its failure to defeat the threat raises reasonable questions about that assumption if israel faces a missile threat along its border with gaza as well as one on its border with lebanon should it then allow a third front to be created along its much longer border with the west bank nor were israeli insecurities assuaged when egyptian president hosni mubarak declared after last thursdays summit meeting with mr olmert that he would do nothing to stop money transfers to hamas coming through the sinai and that he might well consider building a nuclear arsenal of his own if israel and iran were to be seen getting into an arms race the upshot is that even if americas predicaments in iraq really could be eased by the appearance of progress on the israeli palestinian front such progress is exceedingly unlikely to happen yes the administration can try to bolster mr abbas by supplying funds through which he can extend his patronage and perhaps enhance his authority and prestige at the expense of hamas but tens of millions of dollars have already gone down that hole without plugging the drain as for israel the u s might help mr olmert by demanding of mr mubarak that he cut off the flow of funds to hamas and take more aggressive steps to prevent the flow of arms frankly the best the u s can hope for is the collapse of mr olmerts crippled and feckless government something that may take another year in the meantime ms rice surely has better things to do than to chase after this fools gold of international diplomacy contrary to the views of much of her bureaucracy the u s cannot as former national security adviser brent scowcroft advised in a recent op ed merely butt israeli and arab heads together and arrive through an act of american leadership at a negotiated compromise that has already eluded american diplomats going back to the eisenhower administration when ms rice arrives in jerusalem she will no doubt mouth the pieties that have now defined american policy in the middle east for a generation an israeli and a palestinian state living side by side in peace and security along with some of the bush administrations coinage democracy respect for human rights an absolute cessation to terrorism these are the right pieties and the israelis will surely mouth them as well but perhaps her case and israels would be better served by a bit of mutual frankness as with the palestinians israels problems today are largely of its own making and no amount of u s diplomacy is going to save the respective sides from themselves on the other hand nothing israel can give by way of concessions to the palestinians is going to make much of a difference in terms of americas credibility in baghdad beirut cairo kabul or anywhere else on the proverbial arab street maybe once that is mutually understood r e s p e c t will actually spell respect for ms rice write to bstephens
