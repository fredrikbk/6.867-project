great expectations juice up apples trade show on the home page of apple computer inc s web site last week the company began running an image of a bright light emerging from behind the companys logo with the tantalizing message "the first years were just the beginning welcome to " the image is classic apple showmanship a teaser for this weeks macworld conference in san francisco where the company is expected to put an end to months of speculation about the new products it has on deck for the anticipation for this years macworld the main trade show for apple products has been unusually strong stoked by a widening array of bloggers who constantly churn out apple rumors for one thing people familiar with the matter say apple is working on a device that combines the ipod with a cellphone which is expected to be announced as early as today cingular wireless owned by at&amp t inc will provide cellphone service to go with the phone these people say such a product would give apple access to the huge wireless business with nearly a billion handsets shipped every year that dwarfs the nearly million ipods apple has sold over the past five years apple spokesman steve dowling declined to comment on what he called "rumor and speculation" when asked about a cingular apple deal apple could also further outline its plans to enter the interactive television business with a product code named itv apple has a lot riding on its next moves while the cupertino calif company has enjoyed several years of fast growth riding on the back of its hit ipod digital music player there is a growing sense in the financial community that apple will soon need to enter potentially big new categories like cellphones and television set top boxes to keep up the momentum started by the ipod as a result pressure is building on the company apple is also trying to move beyond a recent imbroglio over an internal investigation into improper backdating of stock options macworld will be one of the first times in months that longtime apple watchers will get to publicly appraise steve jobs the companys chief executive and co founder who has kept a low profile since the investigation began last june while apple found that mr jobs recommended favorable grant dates for some option awards the company cleared him of any wrongdoing last month and though mr jobs still faces scrutiny from federal investigators looking into the matter it could be reassuring to investors and apple faithful if he takes the stage at macworld today as is expected and confidently introduces a slew of innovative new products "its a bit like the old kremlin speculation what state is he in " says stewart alsop a venture capitalist in san francisco while the digital music player is still selling well the business is growing at a significantly slower clip as it gets larger apple sold million ipods that brought in &# billion in revenue during its most recent fiscal year ended sept the number of ipods sold was up from the previous fiscal year but down from growth the year prior to that but there are big obstacles to apple becoming a player in the wireless market at a wall street journal conference in mr jobs described his reluctance to get into the cellphone business in particular the apple executive referred to wireless carriers as "orifices" because of the bottleneck they pose in selling products directly to consumers apple has long favored selling products like the ipod and macintosh directly to users certainly consumers appear to be interested in seeing apple apply some of the design know how it demonstrated with the ipod into new areas mike vorhaus a managing director at consulting and research firm frank n magid associates said consumers have shown a willingness in surveys conducted by the firm to see the apple and ipod brands attached to more than just pure music players "both have permission to be anything in entertainment " mr vorhaus says cingular wireless launched the first apple phone called rokr in september designed and produced by motorola inc the phone wasnt very popular because it could store a mere songs and lacked the smooth design and ease of use that many ipod users have come to expect for its part cingular is betting that music phones will help it attract new subscribers in november cingular wireless launched a music service on its cellphone network with some of the biggest online music services including napster inc yahoo inc s yahoo music and emusic phone users can transfer music acquired from "all you can eat" subscription services from personal computers to music phones as for the product code named itv apple preannounced the device in september showing a prototype that was roughly the size and shape of apples square mac mini at the time the company said the product will allow users to play television shows and movies downloaded from the internet on their tv sets the company also said itv which it plans to sell for &# starting in the first quarter of this year will give viewers access to video files stored on a personal computer through a wireless home network but just as in the cellphone business its often tough for technology companies with innovative new set top boxes to compete on their merits alone for space beside a television tivo inc is a cautionary tale in that regard while tivo broke new ground with its digital video recorder the alviso calif company has faced competition from cable and satellite companies that now distribute their own copycat products to television subscribers several years ago mr alsop the venture capitalist recalls taking a team of top executives from tivo where he then served on the board to apples headquarters to meet with mr jobs and several of his lieutenants to discuss tivos technology mr alsop said nothing came of the meeting despite longstanding rumors that apple would come out with its own digital video recorder the company hasnt gotten into the market "if people think the music business is tough to crack the television people are so controlling " says mr alsop theres the possibility too that apple may fail to wow the digerati many of whom have become accustomed to a steady stream of innovations from the company like the ipod itunes and stylish new mac computers some financial analysts have begun warning that a no show by an apple cellphone for instance could be seen negatively by investors because of the feverish speculation surrounding the product
