traveling for business is lonely annoying and oh so welcome its hard to sugarcoat the headaches of business travel there are the cloned hotels the lousy water pressure and the hardly reassuring paper sanitary seals over the toilet theres eating alone giving you the distinct sense of being a loser in the high school cafeteria theres the airport where you strip down to your hosiery to get "wanded" and delayed into ever receding departure times once aloft theres the indignity of spreading processed cheese on a cracker with a red plastic stick but its easy to romanticise business travel if you compare it with the hassles of the office gene matarese the director of sales at a packaging company relishes the peacefulness of an airplane "its the ideal office where youre not bombarded with a lot of extraneous stuff " he says no petty office politics no incessant interruptions and no damage control "i can get more accomplished on a three hour flight than i can sitting in the office for eight hours " says mari baxter a business consultant for a child care franchise adding that she has picked up the same folder times today without working on it shell travel days this month during that time shell work efficiently knowing shed have to make the trip again if she doesnt complete her work the same sense of urgency doesnt fuel her work at the office "itll be there tomorrow " she says business travelers understand one of the emerging truths of todays office one of the best places on earth to have some quality work time isnt actually on earth but at a cruising altitude of feet above it even in a pressurized cabin where the air seems little more than dehydrating microbes and a flimsy seat back tray table hardly seems like an ample work surface it can be heavenly marketing consultant jeffrey hirsch achieves a zen like peacefulness hard to replicate in the terrestrial world except maybe in a house of worship "the feeling is one of total freedom calm and timelessness sometimes nearly bliss " he says "the secular world is left behind no calls no emails no ims no clients no nagging ex wife no problems whatsoever " he says hes more productive and creative in flight thats why some people would welcome cellular service on planes as much as a drastic drop in cabin pressure "im dead set against the idea " says gil gordon a telecommuting consultant who views the plane ride as his "little island of sanity " says mr gordon "its the adult equivalent of a timeout for kids " even when a plane ride is bad its not that bad tony dangelo formerly a consultant for a software company who has traveled as much as weeks a year says unforeseen travel problems taught him how to cope "i learned to reduce stress by saying i have no control over it " he says airborne he says "i only have the flight attendant coming up and asking me if i want something to drink " in a survey conducted by american express business travel of respondents said the top reason they like traveling is "boredom busting" only worried about getting behind in office work similarly in a survey conducted by the national business travel association of business travelers said they enjoy it and even more heavy

and their bathroom interruptions " says elizabeth gray formerly an account manager for a software company gary schmidt management consultant with million air miles says he does his best strategizing on planes and often sleeps better on the road because hes not crowded into his bed with his wife and two dogs "big advantage " he says adding "on the road you cant go to the dry cleaner pick up screws for the light switches buy the can of stain the front gate needs so desperately maids clean your room other people cook your meals and others tend to do the driving " some say travel can do wonders

with his kids in it was by he asked them if he should shoot for days but he says they had seen plenty of him and vetoed the idea now his travels allow him to see his daughter on the east coast more often he thinks his marriage has also benefited from his travels "its like youre dating " he says mrs goldsmith says it brings to mind an inscribed plaque she once saw "how can i miss you if you dont go away " still his constant travel can be disorienting mr goldsmith recalls once taking his seat at the symphony and having the hardest time finding his seat belt "the symphony doesnt move " lyda his
