ge sets private equity limits in auction of plastics unit restrictions on team bids reflect antitrust concerns general electric co has asked for bids on its plastics business valued at as much as &# billion in an auction that appears to reflect new concerns from the justice department about the lack of competition among possible private equity buyers ge has told a handful of private equity firms contacted about the possible plastics unit sale that they face restrictions on their ability to team up with other private equity bidders according to people familiar with the sale effort although the exact nature of the restrictions isnt known one of the people said the contacted firms arent allowed to call other buyout funds about teaming up the restrictions may effectively limit the formation of so called clubs the teams of two or more private equity firms that pool their resources to pursue a single acquisition deal a spokesman for ge which is based in fairfield conn declined to comment ge has been weighing the future of its plastics business which has been plagued by higher raw materials costs and keen competition the business where former ge chief executive jack welch made an early mark as boss and which also employed current ceo jeffrey immelt has an estimated value of between &# billion and &# billion and annual revenue of about &# billion in the first nine months of its revenue rose to &# billion but operating profit fell to &# million acting on ges behalf wall street investment bank goldman sachs group inc has conveyed the bidding restrictions on the plastics unit to four private equity firms the people familiar with the matter said goldman has also contacted two potential bidders in the plastics industry they added goldman declined to comment the "club" issue has taken on greater significance since october when the justice department launched an antitrust probe of private equity funds the probe followed a trend in the past few years toward club bids while the ostensible goal of forming buyout clubs has been to spread the risk of larger investments among the members of the club some takeover professionals have voiced concern that clubs may also limit the number of competing bidders and the value of potential bids amid such concerns restrictions on clubs may become more common among companies auctioning substantial business assets although similar restrictions have been tried in the past they have often been dropped as auctions proceeded and no single bidder proved willing to put up a large enough sum takeover experts said in some recent cases teams of three to five private equity funds have been involved in major buyouts with the value of some of these deals topping &# billion including debt the value of the ge plastics unit however may be small enough for the restrictions to stick since mr immelt became ceo in he has transformed ge by selling slow growth and underperforming businesses including reinsurance industrial diamonds and motors among them are ge insurance solutions which swiss reinsurance co acquired last year for &# billion in cash and securities plus assumption of &# billion in debt ge also spun off its consumer insurance group renamed genworth financial inc mr immelt has also expanded ge into health care information technology water treatment and security technologies his biggest acquisitions include the british biosciences and medical diagnostic firm amersham plc for about &# billion and universals entertainment assets for about &# billion which formed nbc universal ge last month completed the sale of its silicon and quartz business for &# billion to apollo management lp a private equity firm the business had annual sales of roughly &# billion since that sale analysts have focused on a possible sale of all or part of the plastics unit ge has been shifting from commodity products such as plastics used in compact discs into higher priced specialty materials used in autos aviation and health care for example ge has developed lightweight materials including resins for car roofs fenders and steering wheels last month mr immelt said ge would "evaluate" the case for keeping plastics but that he wasnt "necessarily" committed to wait for a turnaround he noted that there was "infinite capital" to sell underperforming businesses to private equity firms or strategic buyers private equity firms buy companies or divisions of companies using lots of debt on behalf of their investors which include pension funds endowments and wealthy families they are called private equity because the acquired companies are taken private although some investment banks conducting auctions have sought to stimulate competition among rival private equity bidders in the past few years no agreed to private equity deal has been topped by a higher bid from a rival buyout firm in one auction that included restrictions on clubs goldman sachs in march told potential private equity bidders for luxury goods retailer neiman marcus group inc they could contact only a single additional buyout firm about forming a bidding "team " the result was that two buyout firms that have both specialized in retailing deals texas pacific group and bain capital llc werent able to join forces on a neiman bid the idea was to keep the two firms viewed as able to mount the strongest bids in competition against each other within a month one of the private equity teams gained permission to bring in a third member the winning bid of &# billion from texas pacific and warburg pincus llc topped bids from two other private equity teams one of which included bain flush with cash from investors seeking higher returns fueled by a rising market and amplified by debt the buyout firms have completed ever larger corporate takeovers last year one group completed a buyout valued at &# billion including debt of hospital chain hca inc based in nashville tenn the hca board also sought to stimulate competition in the form of a rival bid by barring three initial members of the private equity bidding group from adding additional members however a rival bid didnt materialize faced with the antitrust probe the buyout firms have
