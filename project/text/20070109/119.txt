the line on pickups more choices for truck buyers toyotas entry inspires welter of gussied up models catering to suburban dads rocky ballenger considers himself a devoted general motors corp customer and has been thinking of ordering a new gmc sierra pickup truck but when toyota motor corp s new tundra model arrives in dealerships shortly he says he will give it a look and the security specialist in dumas texas says people he works with have talked about trading their trucks for the toyota "a lot of people are going to convert " he says more than ever the battle among auto makers for sales profit and even survival is focusing on large pickup trucks not on the family sedans suvs and high powered sports cars familiar to most consumers this high volume highly profitable segment traditionally belonged to u s manufacturers ford motor co gm and daimlerchrysler ag but rivals like toyota nissan motor co and even honda motor co are in position to give u s auto makers a run for their money the competition among truck makers is opening up a range of choices for buyers there are more models from bare bones two door "regular cab" versions with prices starting below &# to four door models outfitted like luxury cars with fancy stereos navigation systems rear seat entertainment screens and other options that can push their prices above &# fords newest models have redesigned interiors that resemble those in the companys newest cars right down to the leather seats with contrasting stitching chevrolet offers two distinct dashboard designs one carlike and the other more traditionally truck style and toyota sells a rear view camera designed to help avoid obstacles while backing up and also to aid in hitching a trailer most makers offer at least three engine choices and three cargo bed sizes large pickups largely remain gas guzzlers with a rough ride and heavy handling compared with most cars the latest trucks whether from ford chevrolet dodge or toyota seem to have little in common with the rudimentary rigs of old within the past years four door models that seat five or six people have come to represent the majority of sales so called regular cabs with room for just two or three used to be the majority but are now rare newer models have more features geared toward consumers from hooks and bins for grocery bags to folding armrests with power outlets and enough room inside for laptop computers ford and chevrolet models have springs hidden in their heavy tailgates that make it easier for users to open and close them without strain toyotas new model has a damping system that eases the tailgate down softly and quietly despite high fuel prices these big powerful workhorses remain so popular among motorists that they are one of the largest segments in the passenger vehicle market representing about of total sales in people buy large trucks to fulfill a wide range of needs from the towing and load carrying capacity and durability sought by farmers ranchers and contractors to the image of rugged self sufficiency that suburban dads aim to cultivate pickups have also evolved in the past decade adopting carlike comforts and conveniences like roomy four door cabs plush leather seats sun roofs and video entertainment systems that make them good substitutes for the family car or suv full size pickups are especially important to domestic car makers that have steadily lost ground to toyota honda and other rivals in passenger car sales but continue to control the market for large pickups indeed it is the last bastion of u s dominance in the auto industry fords f series trucks accounted for of its sales last year the ram accounted for of chryslers dodge division sales and silverado made up of chevrolets sales toyota has been successful in the compact truck segment where its tacoma is a top competitor but the company which recently passed chrysler to become the third largest car maker in the u s market has struggled to impress large truck buyers its t failed to attract enough buyers in the mid s in part because its plain slab sided shape lacked the assertive grilles big fender flares and other muscular styling cues found on other large pickups this made it wimpy when stacked up against its more powerful domestic rivals but the new tundra is unapologetically huge with measurements that are longer wider and higher than before its powerful engine and aggressive styling are meant to give it a macho presence "full size pickup truck sales are driven by emotion " says john wolkonowicz an analyst with global insight in lexington mass toyota unveiled the most muscular version of the tundra called the crewmax at this weeks north american international auto show in detroit the crewmax has a large four door cab rugged suspension and features large chunky door handles and interior controls designed to be operated easily by a driver wearing heavy work gloves the point for many pickup buyers experts say is to look like you are working hard even when you are really not as practical as pickups have become though trucks still rely on peoples visceral reactions to make the sale mr wolkonowicz says buyers often hope the trucks image will reflect well on them "ask a group of year old women what they think about trucks " he says "theyll tell you that they know they shouldnt but they really do like guys who drive big pickup trucks "
