room boom may undermine blackstone bet hotel stocks could face pressure as cycle shifts supply demand puzzle blackstone group lps bullish bet on the hotel industry has boosted lodging stocks but it comes at an uncertain juncture for the business which has seen three consecutive years of record profits with new construction jumping sharply and room demand softening it isnt clear how long the upward trend can last before blackstones agreement to acquire hilton hotels corp was announced earlier this week moodys investors service inc in a report to its investors downgraded the hotel industry to "stable" from "positive " the ratings firm cited a potential glut of hotel rooms because of slowing travel pkf hospitality research a lodging industry researcher in atlanta says the damping effect of the housing market slowdown on construction and labor prices could unleash a wave of hotel room starts beyond those already planned that combination of factors could help the current hotel boom end as most lodging cycles do on a wave of oversupply sooner than expected and that could weigh on share prices while the lodging business is still flush with profits and hotel companies are being snatched up by private equity players there are signs the up cycle is growing long in the tooth occupancy is down from a year ago while new construction is taking off room starts were up last year while hoteliers have been pushing up room rates steadily the growth rate of revenue per available room a key industry measure is slowing from the increases averaged from to for this year this revenue will increase according to pricewaterhousecoopers to be sure in the last cycle hotel occupancy peaked and supply outpaced demand in and the industry went on to have four more great years and the top markets that account for more than of the industrys revenue are somewhat more insulated from new supply supply will grow this year in those markets and in all the rest according to smith travel research a hendersonville tenn hotel research firm but some of those markets are in the top as far as pipeline ranging from proposals to projects under construction as a percentage of existing room counts las vegass pipeline amounts to of todays supply while phoenixs number is according to pkf even relatively hard to build in markets like washington and new york have big pipelines at and of existing supply respectively of course many pipeline projects dont get built but falling construction costs could unleash more of these pent up projects than usual moodys cites slowing demand and increasing resistance to higher room rates as two of its reasons for downgrading its outlook for the lodging industry it also said moderated development costs could lead to too much construction "i think there is a concern that it could be an unfortunate timing of an overall economic recession and a jump in supply which is the worst possible scenario for the lodging industry " says peggy holloway vice president and senior credit officer with moodys goldman sachs lodging analyst steven kent in a research note three weeks ago encouraged investors to move out of hotel stocks because of their rich valuations and the implications of future development "we are especially concerned that supply growth is starting to surpass demand growth which historically has been a negative signal for stock performance " he said room supply will grow this year with demand up just show projections from smith travel "the current pipeline is huge " says robert habeeb president of first hospitality group inc a rosemont ill hotel development firm "its at frenzy levels " but while the construction pipeline is bursting actual construction is growing at levels below the long term average the historical average for room supply growth is according to pricewaterhousecoopers that is primarily because construction costs have soared in the double digits annually for the past few years the appetite for residential real estate along with commodities speculation and global demand from places like china and india have driven up the cost of construction materials labor and land costs also have skyrocketed yet after rising at double digit rates for the past few years construction costs are beginning to moderate rising about as residential demand falls off says william a crow an analyst with raymond james financial inc who nonetheless remains upbeat on the hotel industry before a big industry conference last month he says he thought the hotel cycle was "heading to the bottom of the seventh but there was a tremendous amount of bullishness from executives of the hotel companies " if development costs moderate further or even fall the pent up hotel pipeline could unleash more projects than the industry is expecting according to a report by pkf "an abnormally large number of construction projects have been held back by abnormally high construction costs " the report says the report posits that if development costs fall next year supply could grow by rooms up from the current estimate of if costs fall supply could increase by rooms "not a lot of construction cost decline would result in a significant increase in hotel development volume " says r mark woodworth pkfs president goldmans mr kent in his note said even if supply doesnt depress results in the near future "investors will likely start to worry about it well before then " putting pressure on stock prices he noted that the development pipelines for hilton which blackstone is buying for &# billion marriott international inc and starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide inc have nearly doubled in a little more than two years and with room supply growing faster than demand hotel stocks could be under pressure mr kent notes that hotel stocks have underperformed the market half of the time since when supply growth was greater than demand growth
