secret weapon how an elite military school feeds israels tech industry groomed for defense jobs talpiot grads go private the cradle of star wars jerusalem after graduating from high school in arik czerniak entered a secretive israeli military program called talpiot the countrys most selective institution it accepts students a year and trains them in physics computers and other sciences its mission is to create innovative tech savvy leaders capable of transforming israels military upon graduating from the nine year program mr czerniak took a different route he helped launch metacafe inc an online company that lets users post short videos such as a clip of an acrobatic squirrel and one of a bikini clad woman making a snow angel now years old mr czerniak spends most of his time in the israeli companys new offices in palo alto calif three decades after talpiot was founded to modernize the israeli army the program has created an unforeseen byproduct a legion of entrepreneurs that has helped turn israel into a technology juggernaut with fewer than seven million inhabitants israel has more companies listed on the nasdaq stock exchange than any country except the u s its start ups attracted nearly &# billion in venture capital over the past two years equal to the amount raised during that time in the much larger united kingdom israeli companies pioneered instant messaging and internet phoning mr czerniak and other talpions as graduates are called have started dozens of these companies in recent years specializing in security equipment encryption software communications and high end internet hardware many like mr czerniak have moved to silicon valley but the results have prompted concern about whether government resources should go toward minting tech millionaires in its goal of creating a new generation of military leaders critics say the program has fallen short graduates and talpiot officials say fewer than a dozen talpions in recent memory have gone on to attain senior ranks in the israel defense forces the idf wouldnt disclose the number of talpions in top positions some early supporters of the program are now asking whether the military rather than a university is the best way to nourish some of the countrys brightest minds something they say a small country surrounded by enemies can ill afford to waste they also acknowledge that the booming tech sector talpiot helped create with its big paychecks could work against the programs goal of retaining graduates in the military the questions arise as israels military leadership comes under broader scrutiny for last summers stalemate against hezbollah in lebanon "the successful high tech industry is a problem for the military " says zohar zisapel considered a father of israels technology industry mr zisapels tel aviv based rad group has launched tech start ups over the years six of them listed on nasdaq "it provides opportunities for talpions the military cannot match " he says israels military says it has been more successful than it expected at retaining program graduates "we think that its excellent that these people who carried out important jobs in the army later move on to contribute to the development of the high tech sector in israel " the idf said in a statement unlike talpiots sometimes highflying graduates the program itself operates mostly out of view during a rare recent visit to the classified program housed on the hebrew university campus here officials would not disclose the work done during the military phase of the program and identified cadets only by their first initials though the cadets who include a handful of females in each class spend most of their days together they do share some classes with other students on campus talpiots roots lie in the yom kippur war when syria and egypt launched attacks on contested lands held by israel the conflict shattered confidence within israel in its military prowess "it was the anguish of this surprise war there were so many casualties " says shaul yatsiv a retired professor of physics at hebrew university who with another physics professor proposed the idea for talpiot mr yatsiv along with some in the defense community argued that given israels scant manpower and limited natural resources its military needed a technological edge many in the military opposed the idea arguing that the countrys young talent could be put to more immediate use as pilots and intelligence officers after several years of debate the military leadership agreed to launch talpiot drawing the name from a hebrew word loosely meaning a well built structure hebrew university agreed to host it in the first class of cadets entered talpiot the class size was later increased to each year the program selects the most promising high school graduates in science and submits them to three years of grueling study paid by the government followed by six years of paid service in the military thats twice the normal military service required of israeli men women serve two years instead of serving in combat units talpiot cadets are charged with improving the armed services through technological innovation some of the cadets delivered avi loeb who entered talpiot in the early s developed a way to make projectiles travel at more than times existing speeds propelled by electric rather than chemical energy in mr loeb who was then was asked to present his project to a visiting u s military officer who turned out to be the head of president reagans strategic defense initiative the missile defense program known as star wars mr loeb says the officer lt gen james abrahamson agreed to provide u s government funding for the project which quickly grew to a group of about people headed by mr loeb lt gen abrahamson now retired from the military didnt respond to calls for comment another talpiot innovation came from amir beker who turned down medical school to attend the program in the late s mr beker learned that israeli helicopter pilots were suffering from severe back pain from vibrations during flight to build a better seat he first had to determine how to measure the effect of vibrations on the human vertebrae together with a talpiot classmate mr beker led a team that installed a custom seat in a helicopter simulator cutting a hole in its backrest training a pen on a pilots back the team used a high speed camera to photograph the marks caused by a range of vibrations the researchers analyzed the computerized data to come up with a way to redesign the seats in the programs early years many talpions went into academia or stayed in the military "we had no idea about tech start ups then " mr beker says "only the grand pursuit of helping our country " mr beker now earned a ph d in physics after the program and helped start a private college for financial studies in tel aviv mr loeb now pursued post doctoral studies in astrophysics at princeton university and is now a tenured professor of astronomy at harvard university talpions pursuits began to change in the s as the global tech boom got under way israel began to develop its own start up culture in part by using tax incentives to establish a local venture capital industry the country also benefited from an infusion of talent from abroad primarily from the collapsing soviet union among more than one million russian jews who arrived increasing the total population by one fifth were well trained scientists and engineers by the current decade u s cash began pouring in in sequoia capital the silicon valley venture capital firm that invested in yahoo inc and google inc opened an office near tel aviv it now has five partners there managing close to &# million in funds devoted to israeli start ups venture capital firm accel partners has directed about of its &# million for europe and the middle east to israel after opening a london office in today the office parks in northern tel aviv and in nearby herzliya housing lawyers venture capital firms and start ups evoke the atmosphere of u s tech hubs like silicon valley and bostons route even down to the coffee shops where deals are done some call the area silicon wadi after the hebrew word for a dried up stream bed "taking risks realizing its ok to fail once or twice wanting to strike out on your own and make something happen that is very hard to replicate " says moshe mor a partner with greylock partners a walthan mass based venture capital group with an office in israel "those attitudes are very prevalent in silicon valley and israel " about talpiot graduates return every year to run a two day test to select the next class from a group of about applicants that number is winnowed down from the several thousand top scorers on a test taken each year by all of the countrys graduating high school seniors during a blustery winter afternoon in a drab four story stone building where talpiots cadets reside on the hebrew university campus the two day selection test was taking place talpions ran one exercise by dividing applicants into groups of in different classrooms a psychologist who helped design the exercises moved silently among the groups in one classroom the applicants wearing blue t shirts with the programs winged symbol emblazoned on the back were given several minutes to complete a task without warning a talpion said they had less time than they had been promised at other times they were told suddenly to switch roles "we need to move on we need to move on " one candidate shouted to the other group members after more minutes passed a talpion stopped the exercise the allotted period had already expired and he wanted to know why they hadnt kept track of the time the idea was not whether they got the right answer but how they tried to find it testing for creativity leadership and social skills final applicants appear before a panel of judges professors military leaders and other officials who ask for explanations on things like the theory of relativity and how solar heating works some of those selected by talpiot say the biggest challenge is realizing they will devote their military service to research not fighting during israels war with hezbollah in lebanon last summer missiles rained down on the northern part of the country reaching as far as miles inside the country to cities including haifa cadets say it forced friends and family in the area to abandon their homes "all of our friends were fighting in the war and we were here studying for exams " a lanky third year talpiot cadet said one evening sitting in his dorm room posters of rock bands and the kramer character from "seinfeld" covered the walls "i felt ashamed that i couldnt do anything " another in the room with a neatly trimmed dark beard said he has to convince himself that the "changes we are making are far bigger than anything we could do in a combat unit " over dinner in the buildings simple cafeteria cadets lamented that soldiers in particular fighter pilots are far more popular with girls than "computer geeks " but they think that is beginning to change as tales of technology ipos become more common the commander of talpiot maj roy shefer says he tries to counter the trend toward the high tech world by instilling in the cadets a sense of obligation to country he recently took the first year class on a tour of the nazi concentration camps in poland "we view them as a national resource and we want to determine how they can best contribute to the state " says maj shefer a year old with thick framed glasses he acknowledges however that the private sectors pull is difficult to resist he sometimes questions whether the country and in particular the military benefits as much as it should from the program "some commanders have tanks " he said he nodded toward photo identifications of the talpiot cadets attached to a whiteboard on the wall next to his desk "i have them " talpiot co founder prof yatsiv says hes having second thoughts about the program theres no evidence that cadets couldnt receive better training elsewhere he says "no one knows if we developed resourcefulness or if such things just grow naturally in people " he says he doesnt mind that graduates are getting wealthy but says that if they arent working in the country "israeli money should not be invested in them " aharon beth halachmi who helped create talpiot as the brigadier general in charge of the militarys research and development arm in the s says the talpiot approach is necessary in a small country "what we are showing is that you dont need a lot of people for breakthroughs just the right people " he says today he runs his own venture capital firm from offices next to a seaside hotel his company owns in tel aviv mr czerniak of metacafe suggests the military could retain talpions by managing their careers more carefully mr czerniak and his class were trained in paratrooping operating armored tanks and firing a variety of weaponry and he realized a childhood dream by becoming a fighter pilot he considered working on a multimillion dollar flight radar project but he says a superior made him a flight instructor instead the military "didnt always step back and look at the big picture " he says the idf says it places a priority on using talpions to their full potential after completing his service in july mr czerniak was recruited to help launch metacafe first in the basement of his grandmothers house near tel aviv then in a loft and now in an entire floor in a large office building in downtown tel aviv during one afternoon employees dressed in jeans and t shirts most in their s and s moved about desks made of light wood and separated by glass walls mr czerniak who last november opened the companys palo alto office has tapped his talpiot network for new recruits a year ago mr czerniak hired ido safruti a talpion who finished the program last july to run the tel aviv office talpiot is "a very aggressive extremely competitive stressful environment " says mr czerniak "this is why we hire from there its a stamp of approval " mr beker who developed the helicopter seat has gotten the start up bug as well three years ago he began working full time on a new company biological signal processing ltd that has developed software he says can test for heart disease at one tenth the price of prevailing methods after listing on the tel aviv stock exchange last year the company opened a sales and marketing office in rockville md the companys head of research and development is also a talpion though most graduates arent involved in defending israel he acknowledges their role in the countrys economy is just as important to israels survival "what we are doing is generating new ideas and solutions " says mr beker "that is very difficult to wipe out in a war "
