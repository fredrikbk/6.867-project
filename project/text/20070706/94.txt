weekend journal sports by the numbers back to the baseline with four consecutive wimbledon victories behind him as this years tournament enters its home stretch theres no question that roger federer will take his place among the greats of tennis but one question can shed light on his games strengths of the players in tenniss pantheon who is most similar in style to mr federer seven time wimbledon champion pete sampras is often cited as a big influence on the defending champ as a youngster mr federer mimicked mr samprass one handed backhand going back further mr federers deft touch at the net and ability to change speeds and spins during the middle of a point are reminiscent of john mcenroe who won three wimbledon titles in the s once you get past those similarities the man that mr federer may most resemble is bjoern borg who won five wimbledon titles in a row between a look at how mr borg and mr federer played and won shows they had more in common than their headbands and quiet demeanor most recent mens wimbledon champions took charge of the point the first time they hit the ball players such as mr sampras and mr mcenroe dominated with overpowering and often untouchable serves jimmy connors and andre agassi blunted the attack of their big serving rivals by hitting aggressive returns of serve often for outright winners mr federer does neither his stealthy serve is effective since hes hit an ace or a service winner on of his serves compared with for the rest of the wimbledon field according to match statistics compiled by ibm but his delivery isnt a huge weapon like those of mr sampras or andy roddick mr federers opponent in the and finals who wins of his points outright on serves or service winners when it comes to return winners mr federer hits few during the last five years and on a percentage basis thats actually below the rest of the field vs the genius in his game is in how he dominates the points after the first blow is struck thats how mr borg played he started as a clay court player much like last years finalist rafael nadal and won two french opens before turning before wimbledon in something changed working with his coach lennart bergelin mr borg remodeled his game improving his serve and shortening the swing on his forehand and backhand he developed unconventional slice approach shots and some inelegant but effective volleys despite the tweaks mr borg didnt change his overall strategy that much while detailed statistics arent available for the matches of his run videotapes show that he stayed at the baseline engaging in rallies on most points indeed his approach was similar to the way many womens champions such as chris evert played grass court tennis in that way mr borgs baseline approach was an example for mr federer since his wimbledon run began in mr federer has won of points which end after a rally no ace service winner or return winner he holds that edge against even top rivals he won of rally points in the last three wimbledon finals against mr nadal and mr roddick compare that to mr roddick who has won of his rally points against all opponents since mr federers advantage grows in games when hes receiving serve he wins of rally points in those games mr roddick wins merely mr federers edge in these rally points is bigger than it seems thats because a handful of points can decide an important match in the last three sets of last years mens final after winning a lopsided first set mr federer prevailed by the narrowest of margins total points to for mr nadal so whoever wins this years wimbledon title remember that while the defending champs shots bring the games most remarkable talents to mind his patient approach recalls a most unlikely wimbledon legend
