can the catwalk be a model for change elite agencys casting call in poorer suburbs of paris reflects integration efforts rosny sous bois paris one night in november in this low income suburb of paris angry teenagers torched a bus and tried to break into a shopping mall the riot was one of many violent insurrections that month in impoverished areas across france by immigrant youths who were clamoring for more jobs better schools and an equal social standing in this country earlier this week esther gomis the year old daughter of a senegalese hairdresser rode the elevator of the same rosny shopping center with big hopes for her future she was headed for a casting call by a french unit of elite model management corp the company that made linda evangelista and tyra banks famous a foot inch beauty with long silky hair and big black eyes ms gomis nervously took her place among the other aspiring models like many of the young women she wore tight black pants and a skimpy white shirt that accentuated her inch waist as she waited her turn before the three person jury her black patent leather stiletto heels began pinching her toes "walk straight head up look at the jury " she repeated under her breath only recently has elite ventured into frances so called banlieues the rundown suburbs that house much of frances immigrant population to seek out new faces for fashion and cosmetics clients elite has usually sought its french models among mainly white areas of paris and other big cities internationally models with dark skin and varied ethnic looks have been sought after for years including somali supermodel iman now a u s citizen and britains naomi campbell in france as well noemie lenoir who represents loreal became a top model as well as a film actress after being discovered in the early s at a post office in her middle class neighborhood of gif sur yvette near paris but elites effort to reach out to a disadvantaged area of paris is part of a nascent attempt by frances establishment to better integrate the countrys growing population of second and third generation immigrants many of whom hail from african countries according to bvp frances advertising watchdog the number of nonwhite models in french advertisements doubled between and but still stood at at the end of last year elites casting call is seen as significant at a time when integrating people in the banlieue is a big political issue "these castings are an interesting initiative in terms of communication both for elites image and as a way for them to set an example " says anne chanon a deputy director at bvp alain attia director of elite model look international the unit that ran the casting call says the agency realized that it was missing out on a potentially large swath of the french population who might not have thought they could qualify "we opened our doors to young women who otherwise probably wouldnt have come to us " mr attia said "we have to be able to answer all demand and offer a representative palette to consumers " french society has long believed the countrys free public schools and generous welfare systems would guarantee equal opportunities for all residents that laissez faire approach is so ingrained that france doesnt permit official counts of the ethnic and religious make up of its population yet studies by academics in recent years have shown that frances immigrant populations face widespread discrimination particularly in the job market a recent report showed that young people without a french sounding name or a downtown paris address are far less likely to get a job interview than those who otherwise have the same qualifications since the november riots french policy makers and businesses have stepped up calls for a more systematic approach to providing equal opportunities to the countrys first second and third generation immigrants although no u s style affirmative action policies have been considered several grass roots efforts have gathered steam insurance company axa sa and car maker psa peugeot citroen sa for example recently introduced "anonymous" resumes revealing only the professional qualifications of job candidates not their names addresses gender or age and other hiring policies aimed at opening opportunities for applicants from the banlieues media and advertising companies have also been trying to better reflect the countrys growing ethnic diversity last summer french caribbean journalist harry roselmack was promoted to news anchor of tvs most watched newscast and many hailed him as a role model for aspiring journalists among frances second and third generation immigrants earlier this year french glamour magazine organized a photo shoot in the underprivileged suburb of mantes la jolie using local residents as models perhaps the most visible step was taken by newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy who appointed three women of immigrant background to his government rachida dati the year old daughter of moroccan and algerian parents who holds the influential post of justice minister senegalese born rama yade who is junior minister with human rights portfolio and fadela amara junior minister in charge of urban policies whose parents hailed from kabylie now a part of algeria french current affairs magazine lexpress put the three politicians on its cover this week with a caption that reads "the new wave " elite held the first of two banlieue castings in thiais a southern suburb of paris last month elite employees put up signs and handed out flyers in the local shopping mall just as they do in the other french cities where elite organizes the contest the signs said the elite model look contest would be open to any girl age to and at least feet inches tall thanks to local media coverage the word spread quickly at a second banlieue casting at rosny sous bois this week a crowd of hopefuls showed up among them was ms gomis who has dreamed of becoming a model since she was a child "when she was only esther told me one day i will be a great african model " recalls her mother angelina gomis "i told her that if she prayed and had the determination one day her day would come " mrs gomis who left senegal for france with her husband in was secretly reluctant she didnt trust the fashion world and worried that as a black woman esther wouldnt have much chance but when her daughter decided earlier this year to apply for castings with model agencies her mother gave in she took out a loan to pay for esthers &# photo book and fliers as well as a class at a modeling school in paris for months ms gomis rushed home from her secretarial classes to practice her walk before her siblings in the familys cluttered rent controlled apartment in the suburb of dugny at school friends nicknamed her "the star " "im tall thin and determined " ms gomis boasted in an interview in her living room "i know that some people think it will never happen and that elite will never pick a black woman from the banlieue but i believe in it " on monday night the eve of the casting ms gomis visited her mothers hairdressing salon in paris and sat for two hours while her mother attached shoulder long hair extensions to her scalp the next day the rosny mall drew hopefuls from white and nonwhite french african north african and asian backgrounds assetou yoni a year old french woman with delicately woven braids stood patiently among the contestants she had decided to try her luck after reading about the casting in a newspaper "for once they were calling for black white and arabic women so i thought it was worth it " said ms yoni whose parents emigrated from burkina faso one by one the women had their measurements taken and then waited for their number to be called "there are no quotas " the shows host warned before launching the event "just be natural and beautiful " after four hours of walking swirling and posing the judges read out the names of women who will proceed to the final stage of the competition in september among them was hadja bamy a year old of guinean descent from rosny sous bois who was wearing a tight black t shirt with the word "elite " "the jury told me the shirt won me an extra point " ms bamy quipped after her name was announced ms gomis wasnt among the winners as the last name was pronounced she burst into tears "im just too gutted " she said before fleeing the mall and heading home but she isnt giving up chatting on the phone yesterday she said she has set up a meeting with another modeling agency for today
