the daily fix woods needs to step up at his own tournament online edition tiger woods better step up if hes going to make the cut in his own tournament in bethesda md the worlds most famous new dad shot a first round at the at&amp t national the end of the first day saw five players tied atop the leader board including jim furyk and vijay singh discussing his day an annoyed woods chastised himself for not practicing his putting "probably as much as i probably should have" enough last week "probably tiger you shouldnt fret about skipping your putting to adore your new daughter " writes thomas boswell in the washington post "we probably forgive you in fact woods may have a unique experience today thousands of people rooting for him because he needs it normally woods doesnt need encouragement on a golf course rooting for him to play better is like telling a lion to have a good appetite its not advice he needs you would do better to worry about the gazelle but eldrick looks as if hes near the end of his rope becoming a father and giving birth to a golf tournament in tandem may finally have frazzled him " yesterday the fix discussed woodss revelation that he played the u s open while his pregnant wife was in the hospital something he said his wife and the doctor told him to do in the baltimore sun rick maese approaches that one carefully writing that the reticent woods left reporters with "a very curious scenario and one giant question mark that most seem content to overlook i dont pose this question because i know the answer rather because it deserves to be asked is it right to leave your pregnant wife in a hospital room for four days while you instead compete in a golf tournament and while were at it should we really be applauding tigers will to focus and persevere through the u s open with such a heavy distraction weighing on his mind excuse me if all i can offer is the worlds softest golf clap " at wimbledon venus williams kept rolling ousting svetlana kuznetsova ms williams is currently battling ava ivanovic in the semifinals in the boston globe the inimitable bud collins begins his chronicle of williams kuznetsova like this "its not quite the midas touch propelling venus williams way beyond the bookmakers expectations after all king midas the champion of ancient phrygia had trouble running in his solid gold sneakers " what mr collins is getting at is that venus and sister serena have been using "k factor bludgeons inlaid with carat gold leaf theres gold in them thar rackets midas would have proclaimed eager to use one himself its a limited edition of at &# a pop do you suppose prospectors will try to hijack them " speaking of fashion espn coms bonnie desimone runs down the sartorial competition at wimbledon from tatiana golovins red knickers to roger federers man bag and matching sneakers with four red swiss crosses one for each wimbledon title speaking of federer he played his first match in hours yesterday taking the court against juan carlos ferrero they played minutes of tennis before their match was rained out federer then won this morning sorry for the potential spoiler but are you really surprised in the new york daily news filip bondy writes that federer "returned from his five day vacation yesterday looking fit and was it possible perhaps even a bit tan surely that was unlikely but somehow federer emanates an air of holiday about him even in the midst of a wimbledon draw it is not hard to imagine the guy sipping a pina colada in full headband even while launching another effortless sharp angled forehand " pity poor marcelo melo and andre sa the brazilian doubles team needed five hours and minutes to move on prevailing and no that last one is not a typo at least the rain let messrs melo and sa win over five days turning what would have been an ungodly marathon into a series of skirmishes have a little more pity for their opponents paul hanley and kevin ulyett "it is not quite the way paul hanley had hoped to make wimbledon history " writes richard hinds in the age "but in the page wimbledon compendium which chronicles such proud achievements as championship winners ambidextrous competitors and players who wore glasses in a final hanley will be listed as one of the four men who played the most games in a doubles match sadly for the year old davis cupper it wont be a happy reminder " fresh off his marathon mr hanley had to go back on the court with tatiana perebiynis for a mixed doubles match happily he won this one in straight sets one of these years the kansas city royals are going to get their ship righted and storm through the american league in the kind of season that will keep wide eyed kids loyal to their own downtrodden teams for years buoyed by that most marvelous and fragile of human emotions hope and when the royals do the kansas city stars joe posnanski will chronicle their glories until then weve got this a marvelous dissection of a single at bat pitting the seattle mariners adrian beltre against the royals octavio dotel "dotel starts off with a slider " mr posnanski writes "hes not stupid he knows beltre is a dead fastball hitter in beltre mashed homers for los angeles he hasnt been nearly that intimidating since then but everybody in baseball knows that beltre can still turn around a fastball the slider sweeps outside and beltre does not swing ball one hes looking for a fastball so how does he not swing at that slider dotel would ask ill tell you how its because this is major league baseball he knows what he wants to hit hes a great hitter throwing a ball on the first pitch entirely changes the dynamic of an at bat when dotel starts the batter off with a strike they hit only against him when he throws a ball its a different story dotel breathes out he knows whats coming next its time to throw the fastball beltre knows it too " the new york suns tim marchman is here to defend bud selig no really but this may be the mother of all left handed compliments consider the way mr marchman starts "it is a good thing that through its history the office of the baseball commissioner has been almost entirely powerless what power it has had has nearly always been used for idiotic or wicked purposes take the very first commissioner kenesaw mountain landis who cleaned up the game after the black sox scandal this was an achievement along the lines of my achievement of successfully pouring a glass of orange juice yesterday landis is regarded rightly as having defined the commissionership the good he did came simply as a result of doing what obviously had to be done and when he had choices to make he usually made bad ones his successors over nearly a century have followed his precedent faithfully " so what has mr selig done to earn praise hes grown baseballs popularity overseen the rise of new stadiums successfully negotiated collective bargaining agreements instituted drug testing and helped launch baseballs digital media arm thats a hasty paraphrase read mr marchman on each of these points "not one of these achievements is the result of selig doing something that was going to happen with or without him " mr marchman writes "seligs mistakes will haunt the game for decades to come and they may overwhelm the good hes done for the game but in a line of commissioners that encompasses the inept the corrupt the self promoting the well meaning yet weak and the deluded selig is something near a titan he deserves the jeering hell receive all summer long as baseball begins to recover from its scandal plagued years but the very fact that the parks will be packed with jeering fans is itself a testament to just how much this eminently loatheable man has done right " tip of the fix cap to readers matthew moore and
