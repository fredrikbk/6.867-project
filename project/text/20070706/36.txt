irans proxy war earlier this week the u s military made public new and disturbing information about the proxy war that iran is waging against american soldiers and our allies in iraq according to brig gen kevin bergner the u s military spokesman in baghdad the iranian government has been using the lebanese terrorist group hezbollah to train and organize iraqi extremists who are responsible in turn for the murder of american service members gen bergner also revealed that the quds force a special unit of the iranian revolutionary guard corps whose mission is to finance arm and equip foreign islamist terrorist movements has taken groups of up to iraqi insurgents at a time and brought them to three camps near tehran where they have received instruction in the use of mortars rockets improvised explosive devices and other deadly tools of guerrilla warfare that they use against our troops iran has also funded its iraqi proxies generously to the tune of &# million a month based on the interrogation of captured extremist leaders including a year veteran of hezbollah apparently dispatched to iraq by his patrons in tehran gen bergner also reported on monday that the u s military has concluded that "the senior leadership" in iran is aware of these terrorist activities he said it is "hard to imagine" ayatollah ali khamenei irans supreme leader does not know of them these latest revelations should be a painful wakeup call to the american people and to the u s congress they also expand on a steady stream of public statements over the past six months by david petraeus the commanding general of our coalition in iraq as well as other senior american military and civilian officials about irans hostile and violent role in iraq in february for instance the u s military stated that forensic evidence has implicated iran in the death of at least u s soldiers irans actions in iraq fit a larger pattern of expansionist extremist behavior across the middle east today in addition to sponsoring insurgents in iraq tehran is training funding and equipping radical islamist groups in lebanon palestine and afghanistan where the taliban now appear to be receiving iranian help in their war against the government of president hamid karzai and its nato defenders while some will no doubt claim that iran is only attacking u s soldiers in iraq because they are deployed there and that the solution therefore is to withdraw them irans parallel proxy attacks against moderate palestinians afghans and lebanese directly rebut such claims iran is acting aggressively and consistently to undermine moderate regimes in the middle east establish itself as the dominant regional power and reshape the region in its own ideological image the involvement of hezbollah in iraq just revealed by gen bergner illustrates precisely how interconnected are the different threats and challenges we face in the region the fanatical government of iran is the common denominator that links them together no responsible leader in washington desires conflict with iran but every leader has a responsibility to acknowledge the evidence that the u s military has now put before us the iranian government by its actions has all but declared war on us and our allies in the middle east america now has a solemn responsibility to utilize the instruments of our national power to convince tehran to change its behavior including the immediate cessation of its training and equipping extremists who are killing our troops most of this work must be done by our diplomats military and intelligence operatives in the field but irans increasingly brazen behavior also presents a test of our political leadership here at home when congress reconvenes next week all of us who are privileged to serve there should set aside whatever partisan or ideological differences divide us to send a clear strong and unified message to tehran that it must stop everything it is doing to bring about the death of american service members in iraq it is of course everyones hope that diplomacy alone can achieve this goal irans activities inside iraq were the central issue raised by the u s ambassador to iraq in his historic meeting with iranian representatives in baghdad this may however as gen bergner said on monday "there does not seem to be any follow through on the commitments that iran has made to work with iraq in addressing the destabilizing security issues here " the fact is any diplomacy with iran is more likely to be effective if it is backed by a credible threat of force credible in the dual sense that we mean it and the iranians believe it our objective here is deterrence the fanatical regime in tehran has concluded that it can use proxies to strike at us and our friends in iraq afghanistan lebanon and palestine without fear of retaliation it is time to restore that fear and to inject greater doubt into the decision making of iranian leaders about the risks they are now running i hope the new revelations about irans behavior will also temper the enthusiasm of some of those in congress who are advocating the immediate withdrawal of u s forces from iraq irans purpose in sponsoring attacks on american soldiers after all is clear it hopes to push the u s out of iraq and afghanistan so that its proxies can then dominate these states tehran knows that an american retreat under fire would send an unmistakable message throughout the region that iran is on the rise and america is on the run that would be a disaster for the region and the u s the threat posed by iran to our soldiers lives our security as a nation and our allies in the middle east is a truth that cannot be wished or waved away it must be confronted head on the regime in iran is betting that our political disunity in washington will constrain us in responding to its attacks for the sake of our nations security we must unite and prove them wrong mr lieberman is an independent
