the afternoon report hiring holds up online edition the june employment report served up no fireworks for financial markets as it came in almost exactly in line with expectations and helped to solidify the view that the federal reserve will be sticking to the sidelines for some time the labor department reported that employers added jobs to nonfarm payrolls last month a reading that while maybe not muscle beach material was strong enough to suggest that companies are optimistic about the future and willing to take on new workers at least for the short term in another upbeat signal hiring for april and may was revised higher as government statisticians found a net jobs that theyd missed in previous counts to be certain the pace of hiring is much slower this year job creation so far has averaged a month weaker than the monthly rate of new jobs seen during and some of junes data looked a bit suspect construction firms took on more workers despite the ongoing weakness in that sector while brian fabbri of bnp paribas noted that government hiring jumped by which he said was "double the recent trend growth" and a hint that the end of the school year may have disturbed the seasonal adjustment process some economists said that a wide disparity between the two sets of data that constitute the full employment report suggested that payroll counts could be revised a lot lower when the government issues its benchmark revisions next year still many economists said recent hiring gains suggest that the economy pulled out its first quarter torpor over the past three months with incomes and hours on the job strengthening average hourly earnings climbed in june while the work week extended to hours up a hair from may consumers should be left with more to spend "the job engine still appears to be cranking along at this point " economists at morgan stanley wrote adding that further weakness in housing could lead to more job losses but that the support to incomes

back in the second quarter " he thinks that the economy grew at roughly a to annual clip during the second quarter after the anemic rate of expansion seen in the first quarter indeed economists at bear stearns noted that taken with other recent indicators like the institute for supply managements factory and services indexes the jobs report shows the "economy ended the second quarter with good momentum " the report meanwhile served to further underpin the broadly held belief that the federal reserve wont be messing around with interest rates anytime soon the central bank has said that it remains concerned about inflation and the gains in wages coupled with a steady unemployment rate it was unchanged at in june which hints that capacity utilization is tight will keep policy makers on guard joel l naroff chief economist of naroff economic advisors wrote that "with firms continuing to look for workers the fed is not wrong in worrying that labor constraints could put pressure on business costs " but joshua shapiro the chief u s economist at mfr inc wrote that there is nothing in the report to move the fed "away from its do nothing stance " janet yellen president of the san francisco fed said in a speech in singapore today that the central bank should be tilted toward fighting inflation while not posing any risks to the economys growth stocks rise in light trading those
