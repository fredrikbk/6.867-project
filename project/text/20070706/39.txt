how japan job growth could lift yen tokyo even as the japanese economy is growing stronger the yen has weakened against major currencies the nations ever tighter job market may be what it takes to drive the yen higher down about against the dollar and against the euro this year the weak japanese currency has aided the countrys auto makers and other exporters by making their products more competitive overseas the weak yen also has been a boon to investors who partake in the so called carry trade which in this use involves borrowing yen at japans low interest rates and selling them to acquire investments denominated in higher yielding currencies as exports of japans core manufacturing products boom big corporations are taking on more workers japans unemployment rate fell to in may falling below for the first time in nine years and stayed at that level in june employment is approaching a level that could end more than a decade of superlow japanese interest rates and the recent yen weakness that low rates have triggered economists say a key level for unemployment is if the jobless rate should sink below this point companies overall would have to raise wages in order to attract and retain workers fatter paychecks would encourage people to spend more which could help push up prices japans core consumer price index which excludes fresh food but includes energy dropped in may from the previous year "the key to higher consumer prices is improvement in the employment environment " says takuji aida chief economist in japan for barclays capital higher consumer prices would allow the central bank to raise interest rates a move that would likely drive the yen higher while a weak economy typically causes a currency to fall the weak currency makes exports less costly and often helps the economy get back on its feet sharp corp one of the worlds top makers of liquid crystal displays and solar powered batteries now plans to hire college and high school graduates in spring a hiring target up from this year and the highest since chubu electric power co a utility that supplies electricity to the booming industrial area around nagoya the home of toyota motor corp will hire graduates next spring more than five times its number of hires in the year ended in march japans companies were on a massive cost cutting campaign during the past decade to cope with the countrys long economic downturn even as the economy grew these past five years the companies held down wage bills by skimping on bonus payments and hiring temporary workers for lower pay and fewer benefits that put the brakes on consumer spending prices which are again falling slightly fell from until last year trying to generate a small amount of inflation the bank of japan has held down its key target for short term rates currently just compared with in the u s and in the euro zone low interest rates led investors seeking better returns to put their money in bonds and other assets denominated in currencies other than the yen as a result the yen has fallen against other currencies in the past years a decline that has steepened during the past few months the japanese currency was trading at to the dollar late yesterday afternoon in new york after hitting a year low of two weeks ago the yen is now near its all time low against the common european currency some analysts say the yens fall while to some extent justified by japans low interest rates has gone too far "the yens weakness is entering a realm that can no longer be justified by economic fundamentals or interest rate differentials " says osamu takashima chief analyst at the global markets sales and trading division at bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj "its time we begin to worry about the risk of the yen rebounding " a dose of moderate inflation would allow the bank of japan eventually to raise japanese interest rates closer to levels in other parts of the world without fear of a recurrence of deflation which damped economic growth after and higher rates might slow the trend of selling the yen to invest in higher yielding assets denominated in other currencies many analysts think the central bank will next raise its rate target which has been unchanged since february by percentage point in august that would take it to which would still leave a big interest rate gap between japan and other major economies and so likely wouldnt bolster the yen much but if it becomes clearer at any point that the tighter job market is indeed leading to a rise in consumer prices investors might then be discouraged from some of the trades that have weighed on the yen this includes in particular the carry trade that is popular with hedge funds despite the benefits of a weak yen for big exporters like toyota and sony corp japanese government officials are uncomfortable with current levels finance minister koji omi last week cautioned against "one sided bets" in the market a comment interpreted as a warning against carry trades he and other officials are concerned that if such trades are suddenly unwound big swings in the financial markets could hurt japans economy euro eases on dollar the euro retreated from
