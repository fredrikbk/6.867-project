apollo talks with arab fund abu dhabi investment could precede an ipo private equitys latest private equity firm apollo management lp is in talks to sell a minority stake to the investment arm of the government of abu dhabi in a move that could precede a public stock listing apollo founder leon black was in abu dhabi capital of the united arab emirates for talks on a possible deal early last week but there is still a gap in how both sides value the firm which specializes in corporate buyouts according to people familiar with the matter and a deal is anything but certain any possible deal would likely resemble blackstone group lps sale of less than of the firm to an arm of the chinese government just before that companys initial public offering of shares to avoid any potential backlash the chinese didnt want and didnt get any voting rights if apollo and abu dhabi were to reach agreement the stake most probably would be nonvoting while little known in the u s the abu dhabi investment authority is believed to be the wealthiest investment fund among the persian gulf countries with estimates of its value ranging from &# billion to as much as &# trillion it is considered one of the most sophisticated investors in the region analysts believe it may well be the largest investor in emerging market stocks and it has a long history of investing in private equity funds and investing alongside them in some of their larger purchases the organization also invests in hedge funds and property it already has a close relationship with apollo since it took up about &# million or almost half of apollos offering of an investment fund ap alternative assets lp that listed in europe last year senior officials at the abu dhabi investment authority declined to comment a spokesman for apollo also declined to comment mr black who founded apollo in and owns about of the firm has been considering selling a stake in the company for several months in one scenario under consideration the firm would sell a stake for &# billion mr black years old would get about half the proceeds people close to the firm say it is considering several options and might not do a deal at all while much of the worlds attention has been focused on china the coffers of the gulf countries collectively hold greater sums hsbc calculates that the six members of the gulf cooperation council which includes saudi arabia kuwait and the members of the united arab emirates hold a quarter of all u s treasurys the countries have &# trillion to invest abroad and that will swell to &# trillion in just three years apollo which has specialized in buying companies that are too troubled or difficult to figure out for its rivals has returned an average of a year over the past years through a combination of buyouts and investments in distressed securities such a deal would burnish mr blacks reputation as a savvy operator though it could be complicated by his tough negotiating tactics and it would also allow mr black to keep pace with blackstone founder stephen schwarzman who took his company public last month and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co founder henry kravis who filed to take his firm public earlier this week the potential investment by the abu dhabi fund highlights the importance of so called sovereign investment funds which are charged with investing government savings booming exports of oil and manufactured goods have boosted government savings in dozens of countries and these funds are diversifying beyond their traditional favorite investment u s treasury bonds that is in part to lower their exposure to the u s but mainly they want to boost their returns this shift has been controversial because of the role governments are playing in global markets recently current and former treasury officials have been voicing concern about the lack of disclosure or "transparency " of these huge pools of money for example at a recent conference organized by the federal reserve bank of san francisco edwin truman now a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics noted that the "lack of transparency and accountability governing these holdings poses risks to the global financial system " clay lowery assistant secretary for international affairs at the treasury raised similar concerns at the conference the rise in reserves looking for higher returns is having an impact on world wide asset prices and currency levels for example the decision of some governments to diversify away from the passive accumulation of u s treasury debt has been one explanation for the weakness of the dollar and a partial explanation of the rise in interest rates in the u s carlyle group co founder david rubenstein was among the earliest and most frequent visitors to the gulf to raise money but recently all the major private equity firms and hedge funds have started to make the journey regularly apollo has always been highly regarded in the middle east "they have a flexible style " says the head of private equity for another gulf countrys investment arm who also praises the firm for getting good prices on deals and for going it alone rather than teaming up with other firms mr black has been coy about when and whether he would take apollo public although bankers say he is likely to do so at a conference in april in los angeles he told his audience that the best thing about being private was being private the abu dhabi investment authority along with some of its counterparts in the region has expressed mixed views about firms like blackstone and kkr going public and the merits of taking stakes in their management companies still abu dhabi and the investment arm of the government of qatar are believed to have approached blackstone for significant stakes before its public debut according to people familiar with the matter the last time the gulf countries received windfall profits from surging oil prices much of the money was spent or wasted this time the governments of the region are taking a more professional approach to their gains abu dhabi accounts for about of all the worlds oil reserves
