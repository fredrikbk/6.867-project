weekend journal review books a cold warrior and his contradictions george kennan a study of character by john lukas yale pages &# even admirers of george f kennan the man most famous for articulating americas postwar containment policy toward the soviet union may well find themselves feeling ambivalent toward him as they learn more about his life and outlook john lukacss short and subtly apologetic biography of kennan helps to explain why that middle initial it turns out stands for "frost " a nice instance of "nomen est omen " kennan was many things a diplomat and historian a brilliant writer an independent intellect and a gifted analyst of men and nations but a warm bundle of human kindness he was not mr lukacs himself is driven to this conclusion while recounting kennans performance on that day in when hitler marched into prague to finish off what was left of czechoslovakia kennan was first secretary at the u s embassy there and mr lukacs recalls how a "few frightened people including a jewish acquaintance came to the embassy that morning in despair " yet kennan "thought it proper and best to turn them out of that building telling them to go home " no this was not "callous " mr lukacs muses but "it was self consciously cold " foreign policy realists and kennan took pride in that label are supposed to be cold their metier is the icy calculation of power and interest never mind human sorrow or values like freedom and justice that transcend the sacro egoismo of states but are deeply embedded in the liberal democratic soul the outlook of ronald reagan "tear down this wall" was as alien to kennan as that of george w bush who in his first inaugural argued for a "a balance of power that favors freedom " in kennans mind nothing must distract from cold blooded realpolitik so kennan detested fdrs freedom rhetoric during world war ii and he disparaged the truman doctrine that sought to protect "free peoples" everywhere but the problem ran deeper still kennan did not just discount democracy he disliked it "throughout his life " mr lukacs notes "he regarded the primacy of domestic politics over the true interests of states as wrong and immoral " but that primacy is the essence of democracy isnt it even beyond the waters edge a democracy cannot quite ignore "we the people " lets put the matter more harshly "reason of state " the realists linchpin is pre or anti democratic a seemingly lofty concept that the mighty routinely invoke against domestic pressure or dissent for all his admiration mr lukacs does not gloss over the young kennans darker side kennan did not like "jews and pro jewish pressures" a distaste that he probably reserved for all groups ethnic or not who insisted on a voice in the definition of the national interest and so early on he set out to write a book advocating limits on immigration and universal suffrage a project he wisely abandoned mr lukacs reports mr lukacs also chronicles kennans baffling appreciation of europes dictatorships mussolinis in italy dollfusss in austria salazars in portugal kennan believed that "their kind of authoritarian government was a healthy and welcome alterative to inefficient parliamentary democracy " in the early days of world war ii before americas entry kennan was directed to move from prague to berlin and to report to the state department from there mr lucacs writes that kennan "regretted the war" and "deplored" president roosevelts foreign policy at this point one begins to wonder about his realism recall that the wehrmacht was still on a roll in the winter of apart from an exhausted britain only the soviet union stood between hitler and the conquest of europe we might pause to note that in thomas jefferson contemplated a roughly analogous european crisis and arrived at a much firmer conclusion than kennans "surely none of us " jefferson wrote "wish to see bonaparte conquer russia and lay thus at his feet the whole continent of europe this done england would be but a breakfast no it cannot be to our interest that all europe should be reduced to a single monarchy " who had a keener sense of the american interest the agrarian idealist from monticello or the hard headed realist who spent his formative years in berlin and moscow kennan was a contrarian of superior intelligence and yet a thin skinned soul who would literally fall sick when attacked by critics his hyper sensitivity and his gloomy personality might explain why his career in government was so often cut short never extending beyond brief stints as the state departments policy planning chief and as ambassador in moscow and belgrade but he entered history nonetheless as the author of the "long telegram" in published as "the sources of soviet conduct" in foreign affairs one year later and as the architect of containment as mr lukacs rightly explains kennan was no "architect" a label he himself fiercely rejected when kennan published the principles of containment in the u s had already turned against its former soviet ally and so mr lukacs notes "he was preaching to the converted " but what a prescient "sermon" it was "the main element of any united states policy " kennan wrote "must be that of a long term patient but firm and vigilant containment of russian expansionist tendencies " the purpose was either the "break up" or the "mellowing" of soviet power both came to pass in the late s first glasnost and perestroika then the collapse but now the conundrum why did this superb realist who had so splendidly dissected the sinews of soviet ambition soon turn into a "detentist " if not an "appeaser " as the right charged and this while stalin was still pushing to extend his sway over all of europe the worlds most critical strategic arena the man who had drawn the intellectual line in the sand in europe who had laid out a policy of "pressure and counter pressure " suddenly began to advocate disengagement and disarmament in the name of "anti anti communism " mr lukacs one of americas foremost scholars of the cold war does not really crack the puzzle a sympathetic though not wide eyed biographer he argues that kennan "had not changed his mind " to mr lukacs the clash between containment and conciliation is no "inconsistency" but "part and parcel of his integrity " a few pages later he backtracks by invoking "a duality of conscious purposes " duality alas explains nothing it just covers the entire waterfront perhaps the key to the puzzle is kennans contradictory personality in the battle between the man of ideas and the policy maker the intellectual proved the stronger of the two the author of books kennan was above all a scholar and critic though fate had thrust him behind government issued desks for the first half of his life if statesmen seek a place in history by constructing a political edifice critics find their own place by "deconstructing" it change the design and the critic will change his aim that is the consistency behind kennans inconsistency kennan was often brilliant in his insights and more often wrong in his murky resentment of democracy and his odd attraction to europes despots of the s toward the soviet union he would play the contrarian again arguing against his own earlier position once it became americas cold war policy but in the "long telegram " he penned the right words at the right time that was enough for a place in the pantheon of american history mr joffe the editor of die zeit teaches a seminar on u s foreign policy at stanford his most recent book is "uberpower the imperial temptation of america"
