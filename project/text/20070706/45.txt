midyear rebound if youre an economic bear this has not been your best week on monday the ism manufacturing index climbed to in june when most sages were predicting it would stay flat at and anything above signals economic expansion u s factories are humming despite the housing slump then yesterday the ism non manufacturing or services index clocked a robust for june up from in may and a consensus prediction that it would fall to thats the best services reading in more than a year meanwhile weekly jobless claims stayed flat at a relatively low and the adp employment report also came in at a healthy level a day ahead of todays government jobs estimate for june all of these readings point to an economy that is regaining speed after its first quarter deceleration to gdp growth that dip appears over as most analysts expect growth somewhere around or more in the quarter that ended on june if the june ism numbers mean anything then the third quarter began with healthy momentum as well this is especially good news given last weeks financial market anxiety over hedge funds and the subprime loan debacle we dont think that trouble is even close to finished but if that fallout has spooked investors they didnt show it as the merger bids and ipos kept coming even during a holiday week two more big offers came yesterday with advanced medical optics bidding for bausch &amp lomb and japans fast retailing attempting to top a dubai offer for a division of jones apparel private equity giant kkr also announced its initial public offering animal spirits in lord keyness phrase seem to be alive and well heck even pimco bond guru william gross recently threw up his bearish hands albeit a little late for investors who were following his gloomy counsel the one place where all of this might be producing an anxious tug of the collar is at the federal reserve the governors have been saying that they expected slower growth to deliver lower inflation with the expectation that they could then call off future interest rate hikes but if growth is re accelerating the fed may have to adjust its thinking our view is that growth doesnt cause inflation creating too much money causes inflation wed prefer if the fed focused on maintaining stable prices and the signs we watch say that monetary policy is hardly too tight mortgage credit markets aside the main economic worry in the near term is congress the legislative pressure is all on the side of anti growth policies hostility to bilateral free trade pacts with latin america and asia tax increases on private equity and high incomes and perhaps a trade slap at china president bush has signaled that hell veto the worst ideas including any tax increases or excessive spending but a president with a approval rating may not be able to stop everything the best we can probably hope for through the election is a virtuous gridlock that lets the economic vitality so evident this week continue
