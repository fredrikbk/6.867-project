forecast consumer stock rebound indias monsoon season could lift some lagging shares mumbai india the skies over india may be gray but decent monsoon rains so far this season could brighten the outlook for indian consumer goods companies analysts say the level of monsoon rains is a major determinant of indias agricultural prosperity and while many shares in india tend to be driven more by the rapid growth of the manufacturing and service sectors and by the prosperity in the cities rural areas still represent a massive market for companies especially those in consumer goods agriculture still provides work to more than half of indias billion people and accounts for about of gross domestic product almost of the area under cultivation depends on the june to september monsoon rains a good rain can put money in the pockets of farmers and farm laborers light rains have the opposite effect cutting their purchasing power a good or bad monsoon can affect an indian companys overall sales and share price performance though it is still early in the season the monsoon is shaping up decently which could provide good news for investors in companies including godrej consumer products ltd which makes goods from bath soaps to baby products marico ltd which makes popular hair and cooking oils and itc indias largest tobacco company shares of all three have significantly underperformed the broader indian market in the past year in the past months the stock bombay sensitive index or sensex has risen while the share prices of godrej and itc have fallen "the monsoon across the country is expected to be good " says jignesh makwana an analyst who tracks consumer goods companies at khandwala securities a brokerage in mumbai "so rural demand will be higher " khandwala owns stock in itc godrej and marico as well as other consumer goods companies the annual showers account for roughly of the countrys total rainfall while the monsoon season got off to a slow start heavy rains at the end of june pushed the total rainfall to above the long term average through june according to the indian meteorological department the rainfall was also well distributed it said the department predicts that overall this years monsoon will be slightly below average but healthy a fuller picture will come around mid july because july typically accounts for close to of all rainfall the bulk of crop sowing is also done in july making it the pivotal month some observers caution that the "monsoon effect" isnt what it used to be as other industries and factors such as booming urban demand have taken over as prime drivers of indias stock market but it can still make a difference itc for instance gets a double bonus from a good monsoon because it boosts rural demand for its cigarettes and lowers prices of the tobacco wheat and rice used in its processed foods division says mr makwana in the next months he expects itcs mumbai listed shares to rise to as high as rupees or &# above yesterdays close of rupees so far in shares of itc have dropped a major cause has been a move by the national government giving state governments the power to levy a value added tax on cigarettes godrej can expect sales of its bath soaps hair products and baby products to jump if the monsoon stays on track says sameer deshmukh an analyst at il&amp fs investsmart a mumbai brokerage he expects shares of godrej which fell yesterday to rupees could reach rupees in the next months so far this year the shares have lost mr deshmukh says investors wont know the full impact of the rains until the end of the year though because farmers wont reap the benefits of a good harvest until after the monsoon ends in september il&amp fs doesnt hold godrej shares this years share price fall reflects how sales of the companys hair color products are growing slower than the overall market and that palm oil prices are at a five year peak shrinking profit margins on soap shares of marico which closed at rupees yesterday have risen this year with a strong monsoon stock of the company could reach rupees in the next months mr deshmukh says china stock prices slide bucking the trend in asia chinas
