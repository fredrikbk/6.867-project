weekend journal travel the finicky traveler welcome guests hello owners fractional buyers get more than hotel guests a disconnect in aspen reclining on a couch in the darkened serene oxygen lounge at the st regis aspens remede spa after a soothing afternoon massage im inhaling the o from a plastic tube and trying to catch a few winks i may sleep better here than in my hotel room where for three nights running the air conditioning system has been clanking on and off like an industrial cooling plant no matter how many times i get up to fiddle with it between sleep deprivation and my need to adjust to the altitude its not exactly the rocky mountain high i was hoping for on the other side of the starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide property meanwhile some friends are happily ensconced in the spacious fractional ownership lodging they use for four weeks each summer and im wondering if i should have taken up the offer to bunk with them in a growing number of resort areas around the country a shift that started a couple of decades ago is accelerating more hyatt ritz carlton four seasons and starwood properties are offering fractional ownership apartments not just hotel rooms so when my friends raved about their residence club experience i decided to meet them recently in aspen and get an inside view of the difference between being a hotel guest and a fractional owner fractional ownership which as a time share does gives vacationers the right to use a resort unit for a certain chunk of time annually is one of the hottest trends in hospitality for a reason for consumers who can afford the costs and want to spend a certain amount of time at a certain location each year it offers all the perks of a second home in a luxury property at a fraction of the cost of owning and without many of the headaches such as worries about maintenance and burst pipes when a vacation home sits empty most of the time fractional ownerships also can reduce travel hassles from lost skis and baggage since most allow fractional owners to store personal belongings in locked closets or lockers residents benefit from the hotel perks like hour security and residence clubs tend to be the newer sections of properties and see far less foot traffic whereas hotel rooms get more wear and tear from high guest turnover that can give a kind of a list b list feel to the properties though hotel guests do get some benefit because there is likely to be a higher level of investment in keeping up the shared facilities like spas fitness centers and restaurants and especially with companies known for running luxury hotels "its rare to have a substantial disconnect between the experiences of a guest in the hotel component and the one the resident is getting " says mark woodworth an executive vice president at pkf consulting in atlanta but in aspen at least the residence club owners had the better deal by a ski country mile and of course they paid considerably more for the privilege the average summer price for four week ownership is &# and in winter it jumps to &# a spokeswoman says the property is sold out my friends had a two bedroom apartment bright and sun filled with attractive furnishings such as a leather couch and a grand dining room table the suite had a separate entrance and came with its own concierge as for my own room besides its exasperating air conditioning i could barely see what was in it even with all the lights on perhaps it was better that way dark brown paint heavy curtains and dull fabrics may have been meant to give the place a lodge y feel in winter but felt downright depressing in the summer the contrast in quality was particularly notable since st regis hotel rooms average &# per night in summer and &# in winter booking online in april for june i paid roughly in the middle of that range the hotel spokeswoman says the hotel used a different designer for the residence club where the rooms are larger and that the hotels decor was created "with a mountain inspired design palette keeping true to the look and feel of the region " with its fitness center pool and meeting rooms the st regis aspen nestled at the base of the stunning ajax mountain is the largest full service resort in this swank former mining town where several new projects are going up including fractional ownership properties built in the early s and originally run by ritz carlton the property was converted to a st regis in and after a &# million overhaul emerged with fractional ownership apartments and rooms including suites the first of several such residence clubs st regis owner starwood has been opening in existing and new hotel properties around the country the hotel impressed me by calling several times to confirm that i was coming and to see if i needed anything like spa reservations or an airport pickup when i arrived at the airport i thought the hotel had forgotten me but it was just that the staffer wasnt holding up his sign he overheard me calling the hotel to find out where he might be and identified himself in fact staffing overall posed some problems at the st regis like many big resorts that import workers for seasonal posts the hotel was using young trainees and temporary help from various international destinations while some were helpful and competent others including those manning the phones had a less than perfect command of english an issue ive experienced at other resorts that import seasonal workers the st regis spokeswoman to whom i spoke after my stay as usual i dont disclose my wall street journal affiliation before or during my stay said "we are very proud to have associates from around the world st regis is a global brand with global guests and it is truly an asset to have such a diverse talent pool " we arrived by van with other guests at the entrance to the hotel marked by a giant statue of an elk a front desk clerk told me i could upgrade to a loft suite from my double bedded room at no extra charge i had to choose the lesser of two evils one unit was dark with a large terrace overlooking the courtyard with a direct view up at the mountain and small the other was dark in a wing connected to the main part of the hotel by a sweltering passageway and big i decided to go for space because id invited a friend to join me for a couple of nights while the suite still didnt come close to the space of the residence rooms it had a bedroom a small living room an upstairs loft area with two double beds two full baths and a powder room i figured if i wanted to see the mountain id head outside over the next few days i didnt spend much time in the rooms anyway we hiked the trails took the ski gondola to the top of the mountain rafted the roaring fork river and of course took in aspens chic restaurants and shops the hotels own pool in the center courtyard was surprisingly small it turned out i was right to pass on the courtyard room for another reason the courtyard was noisy first as workers took down a massive tent after the aspen food and wine festival then as they wheeled scaffolding around to work on chimney flues noise that my residence club friends said went on all day in their courtyard facing rooms for reservations and arrangements i let my friends use their concierge who immediately snagged us tables at the top restaurants in town on short notice and set up our rafting trip the hotel includes an outpost of the chain restaurant olives which was ok for breakfast but dead at night so we dined at local hot spots such as cache cache where we had the best meal of our stay including king crab and avocado salad with cantaloupe and cilantro brown butter vinaigrette osso bucco with french lentils in a marsala sauce and a fresh apple tart with vanilla ice cream though one hotel concierge took a lot of trouble helping my friend set up a golf game and another knew a lot about attractions and activities i had less luck retrieving a message or calling for housekeeping or the front desk invariably i got a young man who sounded befuddled and asked if he could call me back invariably he wouldnt it took a couple of tries to make it clear that i wanted housekeeping to make up the room after p m when i went out for the evening instead of showing up at before id gotten back from the days activities for a shower we left plenty of time for treatments at the remede spa part of the bliss spa group starwood acquired a few years ago it was a little strange to sit in the co ed waiting areas in nothing but a robe still the complimentary champagne truffles and other snacks offered with a selection of teas proved a nice distraction the oxygen lounge had plenty of others like me catching catnaps with clear plastic tubes stuck in our noses hooked to bubbling carafes ostensibly delivering pure oxygen my fine masseuse michelle was worth booking a second time during my stay the subterranean fitness center impressed us less with its so so equipment and dank smell as for the air conditioning problem on the first couple of nights in the loft suite the clanking started in the wee hours turning over every half hour or so i was so zonked from my active days that i crammed pillows over my head and tried to sleep through it i called the second morning to complain and was told the problem would be investigated but on the third night it was even worse i couldnt find any way to turn the a c off first thing the next morning i visited the front desk and carefully outlined the problem to two young fellows when i returned later that day i found it mercifully fixed the st regis spokeswoman says a switch on the unit was stuck between two points causing it to malfunction she adds that the hotel should have responded in a much timelier manner and the delay was "very uncharacteristic of st regiss service commitment " my room did offer free internet access products from the remede spa such as facial cleanser and moisturizer plenty of fresh fruit and bottled water delivered daily and little bags of delicious trail mix i packed into my backpack its true that my view of the street and the front of the hotel wasnt very exciting but if i opened the curtain wide cranked the window open and pulled up a chair i could lean out and look right up at the mountain
