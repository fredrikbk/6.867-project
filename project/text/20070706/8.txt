ahead of the tape help wanted a labor report with some slack the watchword for todays jobs report from the labor department is slack the federal reserve says measures of inflation have improved lately but its still worried that theres little slack in the economy which could ultimately push prices and interest rates higher a key measure of slack is the unemployment rate when it gets very low it can be a signal of labor shortages that create wage and price pressures the labor market appears to have weakened a bit through may of this year surveys of u s businesses show they added an average of nonfarm jobs per month to their payrolls according to the labor department down from last years average of yet even though job growth has been slowing the unemployment rate isnt budging it is expected to come in at a relatively low for june around the level its been at for nine months this is all the more striking because the survey of households that the labor department uses to calculate the unemployment rate shows especially paltry employment gains through may this year those paltry gains suggest the unemployment rate should be rising it isnt because the size of the labor force has declined keeping slack in the job market to a minimum the market seems to be primed today for a strong jobs report that could keep the unemployment rate at low levels and slack worries alive economists estimate the june employment report will show a gain of jobs and a jobless rate still at on a slow day in a holiday interrupted week prices on treasury notes fell yesterday pushing yields higher as traders anticipated even stronger numbers with the market primed for a strong report it wouldnt take very weak numbers to send treasury yields back down ubs economist jim osullivan thinks that over the next several months the slowdown in job growth will lift the unemployment rate eventually opening the door for the federal reserve to start cutting interest rates deal maker and rainmaker peeking at kkrs ipo filing despite recent hiccups in the nations debt markets private equity firms show little inclination to let the buyout boom end and no wonder theyre minting money the initial public offering documents of kohlberg kravis roberts show just how much last year kkr had net income of &# billion a huge multiple of its &# million in operating expenses granted conditions during were the best ever for the buyout business the main ingredient for leveraged buyouts cheap debt was flowing freely and that could easily change but even if its business does half as well say kkr brings in &# million of net income it would still sport immense profit margins when compared with other big money makers google last year recorded net income of &# billion a fraction of its operating expenses of &# billion exxon mobil made &# billion in net income a fraction of its &# billion in operating expenses goldman sachs group had net income of &# billion compared with operating expenses of &# billion when youre making money like kkr why worry dennis k berman send comments to justin lahart wsj com or dennis berman wsj com
