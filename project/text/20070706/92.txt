weekend journal review television struggle for survival coma" follows the progression of four people with traumatic head injuries over the course of one year hbo aired the program earlier this week but it will be repeated monday p m to a m et some patients seem to improve some do not what makes it all so compelling and yet so difficult to watch is the knowledge that dawns on us even as it creeps up on their families whatever happens to each of these four the exact person they were before their injury is gone forever the title is somewhat misleading by the time we see them at the center for head injuries at the jfk medical center in edison n j all the patients have emerged from a comatose state college student roxy and young father alkhan were in car accidents sales manager tom fell from a balcony and college student sean was assaulted in europe and thrown off a bridge as joyful as that first fluttering of eyelids must have been for their loved ones the stark reality of this documentary is that the awakening is a baby step from the moment the coma ends a clock is ticking if they dont make strides beyond a certain point within one year they probably never will the key first hurdle is the one between a vegetative state and a condition known as minimally conscious even the doctors have a hard time discerning the difference for their doting and determined mothers eye contact is most urgently sought "look at me " one pleads "he shrugged " another says jubilantly for neurologists however its a matter of interpreting subtle signs to judge whether someone is for instance making random movements or intentional ones for people this disabled it can be almost impossible to tell there are a few eureka moments over the course of many months tom begins to sit up and even tries to talk hes clearly conscious but is his mind at all intact your heart sinks as he fails to answer even the most basic questions from his doctor about his age and the like but then the doctor takes a giant leap of imagination and writes a question on a board "what is the source of artificial illumination in this room " his arm shaking tom slowly points upward toward the ceiling lights all this time of confusion and frustration and it turns out that hes deaf theres relief all around but what if no doctor had had the inspiration to check for other patients what looks initially like consciousness turns out to be misleading and even for the patients who improve each small sign of progress brings only fleeting elation as one hospital official says after every hurdle is another and for the families of those who dont take the next step the growing awareness that their child may not be coming back feels like a fresh loss "you think it cant hurt much more " says one mother after depressing results from a test on her son "but it always does " and what do you do when your child is as one parent puts it "stuck in the middle of nowhere" forever in one case a mother decides to let her son die in another a father and mother hire extra help in a loving effort to provide therapy for a son they have been told is almost certainly in a permanent vegetative state "coma" doesnt dwell on this aspect of an uncertain science and the even more muddled questions of morality and what it means to be human it lets the viewers supply all those thoughts and questions themselves you dont have to be a new yorker to enjoy espns eight part miniseries "the bronx is burning " although it might help monday p m the series is based on jonathan mahlers book about the summer of when the yankees were in turmoil son of sam stalked the streets with a democrats fought for the mayors job and a massive blackout brought looting and other mayhem the point being that the summer was hell but the yankees world series win symbolized a turning of the tide toward better times shorn of mr mahlers commentary however the miniseries can feel like a disconnected series of vignettes most are about the feuding yankees with son of sam and other events on the side supplying atmosphere like the series disco soundtrack the core characters include yankees owner george steinbrenner played by oliver platt as a menacing manipulative quasi buffoon and me oriented slugger reggie jackson the handsome daniel sunjata whom he hired for &# million to win his team a world series as much fun as it will be for many to see these and other legends of the past revived on screen at its heart "the bronx is burning" is a love song to many times hired and fired manager billy martin hes portrayed by john turturro in a set of huge pointed prosthetic ears that would be laughable if they didnt complete such an eerily familiar portrait of the hard drinking authority hating quick to fight and fiercely competitive martin the fans worshipped him in spite of or perhaps because of all those things and who are we to say that they werent right although he looks and acts like a little devil throughout the character of martin is a link with baseballs past when the controversies werent about steroids but about scrappiness on and off the field for the non new yorker there may be too much reggie jackson to go around after only three episodes id seen more than enough of him and the juxtaposition of yankees spats and son of sam murders was beginning to seem tasteless one pales in meaningfulness after all compared with the other even so the series which seamlessly mixes archival film with re created scenes is transporting in the same way that the movie "casino" made audiences wax nostalgic for the good old days when gangsters as opposed to todays corporate types ran vegas "the bronx is burning" is a reminder that even the s were more comforting in their innocence than is our world today going further back still down memory lane is hbos "the ghosts of flatbush " a documentary about the brooklyn dodgers from and the hiring of jackie robinson to the perfidy of which lost brooklyn its beloved team and some of its soul as well wednesday p m these were the real boys of summer and though their story has been told before and doubtless will be again here it becomes more than an ode to a team that once carried the hopes and dreams of the little man when sinatra croons on the soundtrack "there used to be a ballpark here " who wont remember all the other things from americas past that have disappeared as well
