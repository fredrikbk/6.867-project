why filling summer jobs is tougher and tougher if the lifeguard at the local pool has a serbian or russian accent this summer credit the strong economy the weak dollar and the cutthroat college admissions process if the pool has trouble finding a lifeguard next summer blame congress where would summer be without foreigners to do the wide range of jobs that american students and other seasonal workers once filled waiting tables in the hamptons selling souvenirs in yosemite mowing lawns and guarding swimming pools but even as the u s economy becomes increasingly reliant on foreign workers employers are having to look further afield to find them and the collapse of the senate immigration bill last month means that pool operators and other summer employers may face more problems next year among the casualties when the bill collapsed was the expansion of a visa program called h b which allows employers to recruit foreigners a year to fill jobs for up to six months the bill would have lifted the cap to and would also have made permanent an exemption that now allows in thousands more temporary workers but is set to expire on sept h b has become so popular among resort operators race tracks casinos landscapers and others that this summers supply of visas ran out in march democratic sen barbara mikulski of maryland where the seafood industry depends on mexican h b workers to pick the meat from chesapeake bay crabs for canning has vowed to attach an expansion of the program to other legislation but in the meantime the story of how the u s came to rely so heavily on foreigners to staff its swimming pools and other seasonal venues says a lot about the changing nature of the u s labor force stephen lavery president of virginia based high sierra pools inc says that he hired neighborhood kids as lifeguards when he began his pool management company years ago but that the labor source soon began to dry up college students began taking internships that would buff their post graduation resumes or sought jobs they could continue during the school year high school students signed up for summer courses or exotic travel to build up their college applications there were other factors as well the academic year began to start before labor day the skin cancer alarm was sounded and low lifeguard pay became unattractive in a high employment economy "to americans lifeguards arent cool " says amy kroloff of century pools management inc which manages pools on the east coast and applied for h b visas this year at the same time ms kroloff says the number of public pools grew no one knows how many there are as more apartment buildings housing developments and hotels added them as an attraction most localities require the pools to have lifeguards instead of allowing patrons to swim at their own risk to find workers mr lavery says he "started to beg " even buying newspaper ads in high unemployment areas in the midwest and on indian reservations the response "zero " he says he adds that he has had no better luck recruiting among swim teams or at job fairs one job fair this spring drew people but resulted in just three hires mr lavery whose company provides lifeguards and maintenance to washington area pools says his first h b hires a dozen years ago were germans but the dollar has weakened against the euro and western european students have flocked to european union countries where they dont need visas and can earn more money that has forced pool operators to recruit further east each year this year for the first time mr lavery has workers from kazakhstan and russia in addition to such mainstay h b suppliers as bulgaria and the czech republic "ive heard theres options in thailand " he says of his temporary workers this summer he says that half are foreigners but that they provide "the bulk" of the labor because most work hours a week or more to collect overtime the government hands out h b visas on a first come first served basis but employers must have their applications approved by the departments of labor state and homeland security after proving they cant hire americans and the workers have to show binding ties in their home countries to prove they will eventually return home "its a lot of hoops to jump through but its that or close " says jack brooks who runs a maryland crab processing company of seasonal workers at his plant about are typically h bs he says and last summer they helped the plant clean bushels of crabs four years ago the grand hotel on michigans mackinac island opened three months early so it could get in line for the foreign workers it needs says the hotels president dan musser "we ran at a loss " he adds soon after congress divided the visas in half so that winter and summer season employers would have each it also agreed to temporarily exempt from the cap anyone who previously had an h b temporary workers using the exemption now outnumber those on a new h b but the exemption will expire in september just as the ski season begins gearing up mr musser says of his h b workers this summer are returnees and mr lavery says his returning h bs are his team leaders because of their experience on a recent bright saturday patricia fajtova a year old slovak marketing student explained how she came to be sitting guard at an apartment house pool in washington using a temporary cultural exchange visa "i typed work in the usa into the google " and up popped the sierra pools web site she said a few miles away sanala ivosevic and sladjana savic both and recent graduates of a cosmetology school in serbia were on duty at a country club a friend had introduced them to a sierra pools recruiter in belgrade who helped them get h bs all three women said they opted for jobs in the u s after concluding that careers and marriage will soon limit their opportunities to visit "we have more chance to see europe later " said ms ivosevic they say they put in at least hours a week and earn about &# an hour plus overtime they rent an apartment and a bicycle from sierra pools and paid their own airfare sierra provided lifeguard training practicing english is an attraction of the job "we learn it in school for years but we dont speak " said ms savic another draw the prospect of traveling after their pools close and before their visas expire on her three days off so far ms fajtova has seen only the white house a shopping mall and a library where she took a pool operators test the women expect to finish the summer with a few thousand dollars then said ms ivosevic and ms savic in perfect unison "we will spend it "
