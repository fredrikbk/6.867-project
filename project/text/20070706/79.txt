trading up inside exchanges race to invent new bets amid a merger wave they seek products with fatter margins to understand why financial markets from chicago to sydney are scrambling to merge with each other step inside the tidy office of john "j lab" labuszewski overlooking the chicago river mr labuszewski a goateed researcher known for his scientific demeanor is part of a growing movement transforming global markets he works at the chicago mercantile exchange designing ever more exotic "derivatives" futures and options contracts that let investors bet on anything from the temperature in osaka to the next move in home prices in denver global derivatives trading on exchanges has grown nearly a year on average since to reach almost billion contracts last year the value of exchange traded financial derivatives measured by the bank for international settlements is now about &# trillion thats more than double the value in mr labuszewskis exchange known as the merc surpassed the new york stock exchange in market value in this all helps explain why exchanges are in a merger frenzy they want one anothers hot trading products the four biggest futures exchanges have launched more than new derivatives since about of them from mr labuszewskis team and winning formulas are getting harder to find far more attempts become flops than hits so the exchanges are in a race to come up with the next successes and to acquire rivals to get control of their star products until the past few years most stock and commodity exchanges were clubby nonprofits where buyers and sellers simply met to trade but as technology transformed trading and increased competition at various points the exchanges especially the stock exchanges saw their margins fall most exchanges became for profit corporations and invested in giant computer trading systems to survive by lowering their costs the new trading systems also made experimentation more affordable and the growth of private money pools looking for new investments made the efforts potentially more lucrative with derivatives the first exchange to launch a popular product usually ends up virtually owning the market for it making the trading fees more profitable because theyre protected from competition now exchanges as a group make most of their money by developing and trading their own futures products not by trading stocks a big shift from just six years ago futures accounted for about three quarters of the combined profits of the seven publicly traded u s exchanges in the first quarter of this year according to an estimate by brokerage firm sandler oneill &amp partners thats up from about half of those same exchanges profits in the firm says exchanges have created "product development" positions "just like someone at ford nestle or mars " says amanda sudworth director of interest rate products for the london based euronext liffe derivatives exchange mr labuszewski the mercs managing director of research and product development has launched futures contracts that allow investors to bet on the direction of the polish zloty and the chinese yuan the level of inflation in europe and the amount of snowfall on the east coast among the failed merc efforts was a contract betting on the rate of personal bankruptcies withdrawn for lack of buyers a possible coming attraction a derivative that lets investors bet on the box office take of new movies "we like to think we leave no stone unturned " says mr labuszewski years old many of the exchanges derivatives were first developed privately for big clients by giant wall street financial firms such as goldman sachs group inc and j p morgan chase &amp co that has created some tension as exchanges increasingly seek to adapt the financial firms products for a broader market the merc "competes with us and that is the problem " patrice blanc head of the brokerage unit at paris based societe generale a major trading house said in a february interview yet the exchanges also count on the wall street firms to consult on their new derivatives products and to buy them for themselves or for clients some wall street firms have opposed a merc bid to take over cbot holdings inc which owns the oldest u s futures exchange the chicago board of trade the merc is in a bidding war with atlanta based rival intercontinentalexchange inc if the merc prevails in a cbot shareholder vote monday it would likely again rank as the worlds largest exchange by market value recently germanys deutsche boerse and the nyse have been outpacing it the u s futures exchange has launched a futures contract inviting bets on the outcome the wall street firms raised antitrust concerns warning a merged exchange would grow too powerful but the department of justice last month allowed the merc bid to proceed nyse also has jumped into the derivatives business buying amsterdam based euronext nv in april in a &# billion deal the deal included the euronext liffe exchange which also rocketed the nyse from almost nowhere to no in global futures trading volume behind the merc frankfurts eurex ag and cbot derivatives which aristotle described being used in ancient greece to bet on olive crops have been traded on exchanges since the s in a classic transaction a farmer signs a contract to sell his crop in the future at a price set today to avoid uncertainty speculators then trade those so called futures contracts to bet on price moves theyre dubbed derivatives because they "derive" their value from the price movements of the underlying commodity futures trading poses significant risk partly because the contracts which represent promises by the parties not actual ownership of the assets can be entered into with a small initial payment even though the contracts themselves are often very large some contracts have been banned after they were associated with market disruptions futures contributed to a celebrated dutch mania of the s when tulips became fashionable in european cities and speculators bet wrongly that prices would keep soaring futures traders appeared to gain control of the u s onion inventory in the s the maine potato market in the s and soybeans in the s but in the s and s big swings in inflation and then in interest rates along with newly floating currency prices spurred an explosion in demand for financial futures to hedge against those shifts just like shifts in farm prices next the rise of stock index mutual funds prompted new futures on benchmarks like the standard &amp poors stock index now one of the mercs most popular products and one that helped push financial futures trading volume past commodity futures volume to pass regulatory muster in the u s exchange traded derivatives arent supposed to simply work like forms of gambling they must have economic meaning for at least some customers who use them much like insurance against various business risks banks for instance may want to hedge against their customers credit worsening multinational corporations need to manage their exposure to inflation around the world in the merc also began launching a series of derivatives tied to the weather an idea that hadnt yet swept wall street the mercs chief economist at the time fred arditti had the idea about a year earlier after getting caught in a chicago winter storm which prompted him to wonder what firms might want to protect themselves financially against the risk that bad weather would hurt their business that led to the first weather contract devised by mr labuszewskis merc team it was based on the number of "heating degree days " a gauge roughly tied to the extra money a factory owner might need to spend to heat a plant during a particularly cold winter the concept was slow to take off but now the mercs weather futures are outselling some traditional farm product contracts including pork bellies in washington loosened regulations and gave exchanges new leeway to sell futures based on more esoteric concepts such as events as the big wall street financial firms already were doing mr labuszewskis merc team rolled out event triggered weather contracts involving snowfall frost and hurricanes through a joint venture the merc also tackled derivatives on economic events including changes in the consumer price index u s nonfarm payrolls retail sales figures and jobless claims but none were as successful as bets on the weather the economic event derivatives were discontinued last week after the partnership dissolved over time as exchanges find new triumphs more elusive theyre casting their nets farther their latest focus is on derivatives based on companies credit and solvency but wall street and global financial firms which offer their own versions are proving especially resistant to exchanges getting into that business which makes it harder to score successes in a wall street trade group the international swaps and derivatives association published an page book of standards governing the immensely complex credit futures contracts but it was aimed at isda member banks not exchanges nevertheless mr labuszewski and his counterparts at other exchanges raced to be the first to get into the business mr labuszewski who grew up in the chicago suburb of elmhurst started his career at the chicago board of trade in after earning his mba at the university of illinois he now calls that era "the dark ages" before financial futures took off he then worked at nikko securities where he was a key player in bringing big japanese investors into u s futures markets says jack bouroudjian a former colleague at nikko who also has served on the merc board since the merc "discovered" him in mr bouroudjian says mr labuszewski helped launch a raft of stock index futures generating hundreds of millions of trades mr labuszewski author or co author of four books on derivatives calls the exchange a "derivatives supermarket" that can make money from a large variety of small transactions his "j lab" nickname reflects his experimenters role and personality in the eyes of some colleagues "he doesnt strike me as a guy who wheels and deals " says jamie selway an executive at new york brokerage firm white cap trading "hes in there with a beaker of steam trying to create " mr labuszewskis first proposal for the new credit futures market was a contract based on an index of credit derivatives sold by wall street firms in other words a derivative derived from an index of derivatives the plan met resistance during a summer meeting with representatives of the investment bank consortium that controls the index cds indexco brad levy of goldman the consortiums chairman told mr labuszewski there was no demand for the product "these are early days lets see how the market develops " mr levy said at the meeting at goldman headquarters in lower manhattan according to people familiar with the matter mr labuszewski soon switched gears a small group of merc executives meeting in their downtown chicago office and a starbucks around the corner started batting around the idea of creating a merc index of potential company bankruptcies among companies if any filed for bankruptcy the buyers position would rise in value and the sellers would fall the main obstacle was figuring out how to put a relative value on each bankrupt company based on its remaining assets it can take months of fighting in bankruptcy court to settle that issue mr labuszewskis answer was simple but unorthodox the merc designed the derivative to basically pay the seller cents on the dollar of the bankrupt companys bonds no matter the balance sheet of the particular company mr labuszewski and his colleagues started shopping the idea among potential buyers such as hedge funds and also approached wall street firms in hopes they would agree to buy it and offer it to clients alongside their own private contracts with similar functions again the news wasnt good traders at banks including j p morgan goldman and lehman brothers holdings inc didnt buy into the one size fits all payout they said more sophisticated handicapping of companies post bankruptcy value was needed meanwhile a rival exchange eurex a derivatives unit owned by deutsche boerse and swiss exchange operator swx group was doing just that it was about to beat mr labuszewski to market with a credit derivative index of european companies the eurex effort was headed by brendan bradley who avoided mr labuszewskis cents per dollar approach by saying an auction among buyers and sellers of the private contracts would determine how much money would change hands in the event of a bankruptcy but most investment banks declined to trade mr bradleys version as well they were "protecting their vested interests " mr bradley says the firms say the auction idea wouldnt work for some smaller companies bankruptcies the isda which put out the book of standards expressed concern the eurex product could be used to manipulate corporate bond prices around the time of a bankruptcy mr bradleys derivative called itraxx europe futures started trading on eurex in march anyway but has won only a few dozen buyers "it is very hard to improve on" banks own trading of credit futures guy america the european head of credit trading at j p morgan said soon after the contracts were launched the merc didnt launch its own credit index until this june it had to wait to find out who would police the product the u s commodity futures trading commission which oversees futures exchanges or the securities and exchange commission which increasingly has gotten involved as credit futures are tied more closely to securities or bonds the cftc ultimately took charge but the product has had no trades yet new derivatives often take time to build momentum heating oil futures took years to become successful as did the mercs huge eurodollars derivative a contract used for hedging interest rates on u s dollars deposited in commercial banks outside the u s any new derivative travels "a long and winding road " says mr labuszewski "we had at least nine different pork belly contracts before we got it right "
