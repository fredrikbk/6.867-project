a whistleblowers tale its been more than six months since the u s first shone a light on the corruption in the united nations development program in north korea a scandal potentially involving tens of millions of dollars used to help prop up the nuclear armed regime of one of the worlds most dangerous dictators but never mind its all a bush administration plot such apparently is the considered view of the undp which has spent the past half year variously disputing the u s disclosures justifying undp actions on "humanitarian" grounds or offering an "everyone does it" defense ad melkert the former dutch politician who is the no official at the undp and the point person for oversight of the program even threatened to "retaliate" against the u s according to zalmay khalilzad u s ambassador to the u n in any case mr melkert seems to be more worried about his own job than the integrity of the organization he leads in a june article titled "smear campaign u s against melkert " the dutch daily de telegraaf citing "insiders at the undp " reported that "conservative forces in the american government want the scalp of ad melkert " so its perhaps the right moment for a reality check courtesy of the man who blew the whistle on it all artjon shkurtaj an albanian born accountant who served as chief of operations for all u n operations in north korea from november to september mr shkurtaj a veteran of undp programs in bangladesh east timor kosovo mexico india and elsewhere was outraged at the violations he encountered in north korea after two years of trying to persuade his superiors at undp headquarters in new york to take corrective action he took his information to the u s mission to the u n in may the undp responded by firing him this march a preliminary report by u n auditors issued last month confirms massive violations of u n rules regarding hiring practices the use of foreign currency and inspections of u n funded projects in a series of interviews in new york mr shkurtaj says the auditors who were barred by north korea from going there barely scratched the surface of the misconduct we get quickly to the bottom line did the u n money go to the humanitarian projects it was supposed to fund "how the hell do i know " responds mr shkurtaj oversight was so poor the involvement of north korean workers assigned by the government so extensive and the use of cash so prevalent that it was impossible to follow the money trail mr shkurtaj arrived in north korea on nov he says one of his first indications that something was amiss was when checks denominated in euros and made out to "cash" arrived on his desk for signature "rule no in every undp country in the world is that you have to operate in local currency " he says "not in hard currency its the rule number one of development in order to support the local economy and not devalue or destroy the local currency " "i didnt sign the checks for about a week " he says and then "it became a real mess headquarters contacted me and said dont become a problem youre going to wind up a png a persona non grata and ending up a png means the end of your career with the u n we are authorizing you to go ahead and sign the checks so i started signing " "every morning from to we would issue checks" in euros for staff and projects mr shkurtaj says "then the checks instead of going directly to the people or institutions by mail as they should go as specified by u n rules the checks were given to the driver of our office " the driver would take them to the foreign trade bank where he would "exchange them into cash and come back to the office " north korea did not permit mr shkurtaj to have access to the undps accounts at the foreign trade bank which refused even to keep his signature on file then every day at noontime "north koreans saying they represented u n funded projects would come to receive cash at the undp offices " mr shkurtaj says he was not allowed to require the north koreans to sign receipts for the money or even to present ids "i had to trust them " he says "but hey if headquarters tells me to give the money away ill give the money away " on aug a few weeks before mr shkurtaj left north korea the undp resident representative timo pakkala issued a memo to the staff noting "an increased use of cash payments in some cases to payees that are not authorized to receive payments " citing "undp policy " mr pakkala ordered future payments be made by bank transfer or "non cash cheque " he also ordered staff to obtain receipts and not give money to unidentified people mr shkurtaj says nothing happened "the same routine continued " on jan in a memo to kemal dervis head of the undp he urged that "the cashing of checks from the undp driver must be stopped and undp must demand access to the foreign trade bank in all transactions with our accounts " as the recent u n audit confirmed the north koreans who worked at undp were selected by the ministry of foreign affairs which also collected their salaries both practices were violations of u n rules mr shkurtaj notes too that north koreans selected by the government performed "core" functions such as dispensing cash another violation of the rules all communications tools fax and telex equipment computer servers the local area network "were in the hands of the north koreans " "all the backup data for the offices computers were in a storage place completely isolated with a north korean the chief of it " when mr shkurtaj wanted to file a secure report "i would go use the telex and communications satellite at the german embassy or other embassies in the compound " a north korean li kum sun controlled the office safe in her job as "finance officer " "damn it " says mr shkurtaj "you had security evacuation plans in the hands of a north korean its unbelievable " one of his few on the job successes was to get control of the safe and petty cash taken away from ms li and handed over to him in march the u n audit also found numerous irregularities regarding on site inspections of undp projects most projects are located outside pyongyang and mr shkurtaj says one way to determine whether the required annual field visits actually took place is whether the inspectors filed expense accounts "everybody meaning one driver one translator and one or two international staff would have received per diems " he says or submitted vouchers for gas or overtime "that is the proof that people checked the project " yet "in nearly two years in north korea i signed for a maximum of two or three" such trips mr shkurtaj recounts two inspections he attempted to carry out himself in one case undp paid for computers intended for kim il sung university "instead of the computers coming to undp they went to a warehouse outside town and we were allowed to inspect them only after a month and a half of fighting with the government then we were allowed to inspect only one computer in one box the other boxes were not allowed to be opened " another inspection charade involved gps equipment supposedly going to an agricultural project on flood control "they didnt allow us for three and a half months to see the gpss that we gave them " mr shkurtaj says finally he says "they took us to the outskirts of pyongyang to an empty building completely empty no desk no chairs no nothing we come in and go to the first floor empty we go to the second floor empty on the last door of the second floor we enter there is only one desk in the middle of the room and on the desk are the gps devices that we provided now youre telling me we are providing gps devices for an empty building without people working inside " during the years he worked for undp in pyongyang mr shkurtaj says he filed numerous reports to his superiors but got nowhere finally with several months to go in his tour of duty in north korea he was recalled to new york he says that david lockwood deputy assistant administrator of the undp told him "look it would be good for your future if you come to new york and from here well send you somewhere else in the world but you have rocked the boat too much right now and you should leave for your own good " mr shkurtajs last day in north korea was sept when his contract came up for renewal in march the vast majority of u n employees operate under work contracts he was told that after years of employment at undp his services would no longer be needed a few months before his dismissal he received an "outstanding" rating in his annual review dated dec and signed by romulo garcia chief of the northeast asia and mekong division mr garcia described mr shkurtaj as "quick professional highly competent creative hard working and dedicated " mr shkurtaj has filed a complaint with the u n ethics office asking for reinstatement under the u n whistleblower protection policy yesterday rep ilena ros lehtinen ranking republican on the house foreign affairs committee wrote u n secretary general ban ki moon asking him to look into mr shkurtajs dismissal his case "appears to be a fundamental test of the uns whistleblower protection policy one of the touted hallmarks of internal u n reform in recent years " she writes "it is also highly relevant to whether undp has adequately internalized the need for increased transparency and accountability " her request followed a similar letter to mr ban last week from sen norman coleman asking that mr shkurtaj be accorded whistleblower protection meanwhile mr shkurtaj has sent his wife and two children home to italy he is an italian citizen and is fast depleting his savings he says he is "living like a bum" in new york see related letter "letters to the editor a sure fire prescription for cleaning up the u n " wsj july ms
