politics &amp economics how terrorists goals may be melding two years ago analysts at the department of homeland security speculated that the quick hit strikes in iraq favored by jordanian terrorist abu musab al zarqawi could inspire a shift in tactics by osama bin ladens planners who had favored spectacular coordinated assaults specifically they feared the two styles could be merged u s security officials worry their fears may be coming true that attempts by a diverse group of jihadis to attack nightclubs and airports in britain signal a new model of islamist terrorism has arrived less ambitious than the attacks of sept but potentially deadly nonetheless and even more difficult to detect the possible tactical shift involving seemingly untrained operatives using simple weapons and hasty planning raises difficult questions for security services especially regarding resource allocation should they prepare to detect and disrupt only major catastrophic attacks or shadow every possible extremist in the hope of pre empting more likely attacks on for example shopping malls using a homemade gasoline bomb or legally purchased firearms "the need to disrupt an ever wider range of plots and to investigate suspects who at first might only seem peripheral puts a major strain on our resources " says michael downing the los angeles deputy police chief for counterterrorism "we need this richer picture of intelligence to do our job but it comes at a high price " in the face of global counterterrorism efforts to toughen airline security and increase surveillance of suspect groups al qaeda has adopted a two pronged parallel strategy federal counterterrorism officials believe one is to encourage local muslims to join their jihad and kill however they can at the same time their chief planners continue to plan and work for "the big one " investigators in london are working their way through a labyrinth of leads to establish how eight people arrested in the british bomb plots this week had come into contact with each other and planned the attacks two are from india six are from the middle east and all had medical connections including at least four who were doctors no one has been charged in connection with two unexploded london car bombs last week and a botched attack on glasgows airport in scotland on saturday using a flaming fuel laden sport utility vehicle security officials are looking hard at the possibility that at least one of the plotters may be linked to al qaedas wing in iraq which was headed by mr zarqawi until his death in a u s bombing raid last year mr zarqawi rose to prominence in iraq by carrying out a sustained campaign of simple attacks against lightly defended targets using a combination of executions suicide attackers and homemade bombs he challenged the u s presence in the country in early mr bin laden sent him a letter with orders to widen operations outside iraq and carry out attacks directly against the u s the prospect led to several studies of what those attacks might look like one previously undisclosed report done in august for the department of homeland security "speculating on an al zarqawi campaign against the homeland " said the alliance would likely lead to waves of quickly planned and executed attacks the internal report which wasnt classified noted that while al qaeda focused on large iconic targets in operations involving years of planning mr zarqawis attacks were far less sophisticated "they do not require experienced operatives and can be planned and executed in a matter of days or weeks vice sic years his targets are ones of opportunity accessible and vulnerable and his methods of attacks include suicide car bombings improvised explosive device attacks kidnappings and assassinations " it said that if mr zarqawi were to lead attacks against the u s the campaigns would likely involve fewer operatives shorter planning time lines and focus on soft targets the plots would by their very nature "be more difficult to detect during the planning stages and more difficult to prevent during the execution stages " at the time there was little evidence to support the concerns mr zarqawi showed little enthusiasm before his death for moving his focus outside iraq and his jordanian homeland but security officials close to the london investigation say the latest british bomb plots appear to be a hybrid of mr zarqawis methods and al qaedas use of multiple coordinated attacks the two car bombs last week were meant to explode outside separate nightclubs the plot also involved seemingly untrained operatives and simple bombs made from household items police discovered and disarmed the explosives only after one of the detonating mechanisms malfunctioned and after an ambulance crew reported smoke coming from a parked car the british failure to anticipate the attacks has prompted changes in the u s including increased security around large nightclubs financial institutions and airports
