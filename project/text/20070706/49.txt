metal makers go far for cheap fuel trinidad draws nucor others as competition spurs cost saving moves point lisas trinidad les hart pointed along the coastline of this sunny caribbean shore the way a tourist might point out a dolphin but he was indicating a series of fat pipelines bringing cheap abundant natural gas from an undersea field to the iron refinery he manages the fuel supplys economics are so compelling that mr harts employer steelmaker nucor corp cut the refinery into pieces and shipped it across the sea from its original home near new orleans to take advantage of the lower costs "these are the two reasons people set up shop here " said mr hart the facilitys general manager "natural gas and a port " metal makers such as nucor are flocking to trinidad a tiny island nation seven miles off the coast of venezuela that is trying to capitalize on its natural gas and oil resources while venezuela nationalizes industries and kicks out large multinational investors trinidad officials say they talk with three or four companies a month that want to join players such as nucor and steel giant mittal steel co western manufacturers chemical makers and metal companies face intensifying competition from fast growing companies in places like the middle east and russia that offer cheap sources of oil and gas they also face growing competition from asian companies with other cost advantages like labor in response they are flocking to countries such as trinidad and iceland and to other places farther afield with cheap and abundant energy century aluminum co of monterey calif is expanding its aluminum smelter in grundartangi iceland alcoa inc based in both pittsburgh and new york would also like to expand in iceland and build a second aluminum smelter there to take advantage of lower cost energy generated by hydropower or geothermal power rival aluminum maker alcan inc of montreal has focused on gaining a presence in the energy rich middle east recently pledging &# billion toward a partnership with a government mining refining and smelting operation in saudi arabia the company already has a joint venture smelter project under way in sohar oman that is slated to start producing next year many of the markets bring their own sets of challenges environmental concerns and protests in iceland could limit future development and add to costs alcans joint venture approach and minority stakes in the middle east make it more difficult to control a project and therefore difficult to maximize revenue and profit there meanwhile companies locating in trinidad face a labor shortage and they must worry about the extent of the energy reserves some estimate the country has only years of natural gas reserves left ken julien chairman of trinidads natural gas export task force which makes decisions on how to use the countrys reserves says more untapped deposits could be discovered "the pattern in trinidad is the more they use the more they find " he said trinidad is the rd largest producer of natural gas according to frontier strategy group of cambridge mass nucors plant is one of the new large scale metal making operations valued at more than &# billion that are either already running or on the drawing board for the island indian steel maker essar group plc and alcoa have plans for manufacturing facilities that will cost more than &# billion each energy intensive manufacturers also welcome trinidads relatively streamlined bureaucracy and stability "because we are a small country with a centralized decision making process companies get a quick decision " said mr julien a former engineering professor nucor of charlotte n c didnt have much in the way of overseas assets when it acquired the new orleans refinery in joe rutkowski an executive vice president at nucor for business development said the company couldnt find an efficient way to operate the louisiana plant because of high natural gas prices it considered moving the refinery to the middle east or latin america including venezuela but couldnt accept the risk "you can talk about venezuela but at the end of the day you are scared to death of political instability there " mr rutkowski said the company settled on point lisas cutting up and moving the plant on barges the last of it five days before hurricane katrina struck new orleans in production at the reassembled plant began earlier this year and is expected to reach two million tons a year of special iron ore pellets which will be shipped to nucors electric arc furnaces in alabama and south carolina to be melted into steel trinidad boasted a annual growth rate last year that success has in turn created a skilled labor shortage in a country whose unemployment has dropped to about from in according to government data "wages tend to increase at a higher rate than they do in the states because there is competition for these good people " said nucors mr hart noting that wages are going up a year "we are trying to recalibrate ourselves to what we need to pay our folks competitively so we dont actually lose our folks to other companies " it is hard too he said finding highly skilled workers that fit in with nucors culture known for being fast paced lean and bonus oriented with extra pay tied to high levels of production the company puts potential recruits through psychological screening to see if they fit the mold three years ago the country launched the university of trinidad and tobago with a heavy focus on manufacturing and engineering the university is joining up with companies to have students work on projects for industry and to make sure they learn the skills industries require mr hart said nucor plans to team up more with the university and others to find workers such as marcus singh a supervisor at the nu iron plant when he finishes his shift mr singh often heads to class to complete his chemical engineering degree at the universitys point lisas campus after high school mr singh now years old went to work for a string of industrial companies an oil refinery a methanol plant and a plant shipping liquefied natural gas but after a dozen years as an entry level worker factory jobs "got pretty boring " said mr singh who aspires to move further into management at nucor "i needed something a little more challenging "
