lifestyles but nonprofits say they are receiving an increasing number of "stretch" gifts donations seemingly out of proportion to the givers resources to the shock or chagrin of friends and family these gifts often require donors to make sacrifices or at least live more modestly than their income would allow there have always been examples of exceptional gifts by supposedly ordinary people such as oseola mccarty the elderly washerwoman who in gave &# to the university of southern mississippi for scholarships but now according to nonprofits such donors are getting younger their gifts seem to
