flag banning its the week to wave the flag as millions did on the fourth however in the case of minnesota perhaps we should say "waive" the flag at least if it happens to have been made overseas in st paul this week the legislature passed a law making it a misdemeanor to sell a non made in the usa flag anywhere in the state "nothing is more embarrassing to me than a plastic flag made in china " declared tom rukavina who sponsored the bill actually we can think of several things more embarrassing starting with mr rukavina under the minnesota flag law violators could be subject to a &# fine and days in jail so under mr rukavinas patriot gaming and thanks to the supreme courts decision in texas v johnson minnesotans will be able to legally burn an american flag made in america but could go to jail for selling one made in shanghai splendid proponents say this protectionism is about national symbolism so lets not tell them that major league baseballs have been made in costa rica for years we also wont tell mr rukavina where his favorite hot dogs are made much less what theyre made of the commerce department says about &# million worth of flags were imported last year so the ban will not make much of a dent in our trade deficit according to the associated press the biggest recent surge in flag imports came after september luckily for minnesotans mr rukavina wasnt around to criminalize that patriotic sentiment old glory stands for freedom including the right to trade with people of other nationalities we suspect that when most americans wave the flag they care more about the ideas it represents than where it was made see related letter "letters to the editor citizens beware do you know your flags origin " wsj july see related letter "letters to the editor its a grand old american made flag" wsj july
