why bid to allow lawsuits against opec may fly soaring gasoline costs give fuel to lawmakers a quandary for bush washington in the summer of with his constituents complaining about paying more than &# for a gallon of gasoline sen herbert h kohl drafted a bill that would allow members of opec the international oil cartel to be sued under u s antitrust laws congressional leaders regarded the wisconsin democrats measure dubbed nopec a nonstarter and it went nowhere fast forward to this summer with gasoline prices hovering near &# a gallon to the surprise of many mr kohls measure is now one of the most popular elements of energy bills emerging from congress and is backed by lopsided veto proof votes as a result the measure could be heading to the desk of president bush and there it will present a thorny problem the white houses office of management and budget said it would advise the president to veto nopec because exposing the organization of petroleum exporting countries to lawsuits could trigger a variety of legal political and economic headaches for the u s at the same time the bill contains other measures mr bush wants including a federal mandate to use more alternative fuels such as ethanol sean kevelighan an omb spokesman says the white house "adamantly" opposes nopec he wouldnt say whether its inclusion would make the bill a veto candidate mr bush "will make his statement when and if the bill emerges " mr kevelighan said the bills backers say it is more than just a publicity stunt to please constituents "nopec is one of those things that we should have in our arsenal " says rep steve chabot an ohio republican and one of the bills sponsors in the house in mr chabots district which includes cincinnati gasoline prices and immigration are the two main issues as for the prospect of retaliation by opec he says "i dont see it as a serious problem because theyre already acting in a manner thats against our best interests " last month the senate made nopec part of its energy measure by a vote of in may the house approved it as a stand alone bill nopecs inclusion in the house energy bill appears likely because it has the backing of rep nancy pelosi the california democrat who is house speaker crude oil futures in new york settled yesterday at &# a barrel up cents that is higher than the lowest settlement price this year &# jan under existing u s court opinions the dozen members of the oil cartel act as sovereign governments when they limit oil supplies and are thus immune from u s antitrust laws under u s law a sovereign cant be sued without its consent nopec would fix that by allowing the justice department to sue opec members for price fixing in u s courts under the sherman act and to seize foreign owned property in the u s to pay for any resulting damages after nopec sailed through the house the white house issued a statement claiming such actions would backfire quickly leading foreign governments to seize american owned property abroad and perhaps cut back oil shipments "this bill has the potential to lead to oil supply disruptions and an escalation in the price of gasoline " it said threatening a veto some members of the cartel seem to be on red alert asked about nopec last week during a news conference in istanbul mohamed al hamli the united arab emirates oil minister and current president of opec said "if a state wanted to sue an opec member state that would be a very dangerous step " he didnt elaborate abdalla salem el badri opecs general secretary said nopec wouldnt help lower high u s gasoline prices which he blamed in part on u s refinery problems "we should stay away from litigation and solve our problems through dialogue between energy producers and consumers " mr badri said opec which accounts for more than a third of world oil output has toughened its stance on raising production from recent years when oil prices approached new highs the new posture evident this year pays close attention to crude oil inventories in consumer hands with a view to keeping them tight that has contributed to a rise in prices in recent days and led some forecasters to predict more increases this year the cartel says the world has ample supplies of crude and that inadequate refining capacity and other issues outside its control are driving up prices nopec has plenty of opponents in the u s too red cavaney president and chief executive of the american petroleum institute trade association called nopec "very strange" and held out hope that mr bush will veto it larry goldstein a director of the energy policy research foundation an independently funded oil industry think tank says lawmakers are playing in risky territory "our friends in the middle east dont know that were just venting steam this plays as being much more serious and harder than it should outside the country " he said suggesting the idea may tempt opec members to withdraw investments from the u s and sell more oil to asia mr kohl says nopec will improve the dialogue with opec "the mere passage of this would not cause any disruptions" and would only present opec leaders with the possibility of a "brake" on their future actions "in terms of voting for this theres no downside you are voting for your consumers " antitrust experts are split george a bermann a professor at columbia university law school doesnt think the passage of nopec will cause problems overseas because the proposal only allows the justice department rather than individual citizens to sue opec members that would allow the president to weigh the foreign policy effects before deciding whether to sue "he couldnt hope for more because the right to litigate is taken out of the hands of private claimants " mr bermann says albert a foer president of the american antitrust institute a nonprofit research group disagrees even a rumored lawsuit would "become an international issue of major concern we would have threats to cut off oil supplies and retaliate in a variety of ways this is an issue thats just too important to be left to the antitrusters " all this brings some satisfaction to carl g prewitt years old who owned a texaco filling station on the outskirts of birmingham ala for years after watching oil prices go up and his profit go down he sued opec in charging it violated u s antitrust laws when the cartel refused to appear in u s district court in birmingham a judge there decided for mr prewitt no money damages were awarded but the court slapped an injunction on opec requiring that it not fix prices in the future that sent opec lawyers rushing to the u s court of appeals in atlanta where a judge ruled in that opec couldnt be served legal papers in the case because of sovereign immunity language in nopec would overturn that ruling mr prewitt says he thinks he did the right thing "you can just sit around and take so much " he says he sold his gasoline station in february and now runs a landscaping business
