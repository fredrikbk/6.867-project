weekend journal taste bleak mythology the american museum of natural historys recently opened exhibit "mythic creatures dragons unicorns &amp mermaids " has enjoyed brisk attendance and largely positive press attention reporters have noted the foot long greenish dragon that greets visitors at the entrance to the show as well as renderings of unicorns griffins and a gigantic bird called the "roc " "mythic creatures give shape to humankinds greatest hopes fears and most passionate dreams " the online introduction to the exhibit gushes perhaps but in an age of abysmal science literacy with fantastical technological distractions a mere mouse click away what does the museums decision to focus on make believe monsters tell us about this venerable institution according to its curators the exhibit seeks to demonstrate how people throughout history have tried to understand the mysteries of the natural world however misguided their attempts often were the exhibit certainly gives a sense of the creativity and wackiness of the human mind as the online version of the exhibit describes some of the creatures are the product of imagination like the bunyip a howling man eating monster of australian legend others are clearly manmade deceptions such as the feejee mermaid half fish half monkey wholly grotesque the exhibit also includes real creatures thought to have inspired their mythic kin such as a rendering of the huge extinct primate gigantopithecus blacki which lived in southeast asia and whose fossilized bones were likely the source for local legends about giants understanding the unusual beliefs and scientific fallacies of earlier eras is important of course and amnh is a good place to sponsor such an exploration as with many other natural history museums founded in the th century its dusty dioramas and collections which in the s featured a modest stuffed badger and dodo have given way to vast troves of specimens pored over by fleets of excellent scientists and curators it has also long been preoccupied by questions of what makes us human and why we believe what we do the museum still boasts of the work done there by anthropologists franz boas and margaret mead and notes that it has been "a leader in forging new theories on the way we look at cultures " but as "mythic creatures" suggests a museum that attempts to study human beliefs scientifically will soon find that many firmly held beliefs are not in fact scientific indeed one need not travel to the homes of backward tribes on exotic pacific isles to find such beliefs buried in the museums archives are the artifacts of one of our own cultural myths eugenics the eugenics movement which sought to improve the human race through better breeding and led to immigration restrictions and compulsory sterilization laws in the early th century u s had a large and influential following one of its most avid supporters was henry fairfield osborn the museums president from until his retirement in a paleontologist by trade he made the museum a hive of eugenics activity for decades the museum hosted international eugenics congresses and joint sessions of the eugenics research association and the american eugenics society osborn and his friend madison grant a museum trustee and an outspoken racist were strong supporters of limiting immigration their efforts bore fruit with the passage of the immigration restriction act which placed quotas on immigrants from southern and eastern europe because of their supposed racial defectiveness one of the first things osborn did after retiring as president of the museum was to take a busmans holiday in nazi germany osborns nephew frederick osborn spent several years studying eugenics with his uncle at the museum and eventually took over leadership of the american eugenics society in the s most people are unaware of the museums eugenic past and officials there understandably are in no hurry to enlighten them the american museum of natural historys darwin exhibit last year played down darwins support for eugenics and neglected to mention its own role in the american eugenics movement but the museums embrace of eugenics was in keeping with its mission at the time its purpose according to osborn was not merely educating the public about science but encouraging the "propagation of socially desirable views " has this mission changed mythic creatures are a far cry from eugenics of course and the museum has been scrupulous about eliminating incorrect displays such as the one that well into the mid th century featured the developing races of man with apes at the bottom and whites at the apex the old style "hall of the age of man" has been reborn as the "anne and bernard spitzer hall of human origins " complete with spiffy new interactive models and lots of information about dna but the museum still describes its purpose as more socially transformative than strictly educational "in these exciting and challenging times " one description reads "the museum will continue to seize extraordinary opportunities to transform our scientific vision into meaningful results a strategy that has served the museum throughout its history " well not always in a culture where old fashioned fantasy has been replaced by the television and video game industries and scientists create real human animal chimeras for experimentation perhaps there is something reassuring about exhibiting the quaint beliefs of previous eras it reinforces the conviction that ours is a more sophisticated and scientifically literate age it flatters our belief that the rational study of the natural world and its inhabitants will somehow inoculate us against the all too human urge to exploit nature and one another but this is wishful thinking on par with a belief in unicorns in the future when curators at the american museum of natural history want to demonstrate the scientific missteps and misunderstandings of earlier generations they need not mine the mythic past for material the museums own eugenic history is the gigantopithecus in the room ms rosen is a fellow at the ethics &amp public policy center in
