weekend journal review theater history under the stars the lost colony waterside theatre fort raleigh historic site highway manteo n c &# &# closes aug unto these hills a retelling mountainside theatre drama road cherokee n c &# &# closes aug manteo n c outdoor drama is as old as the greeks and as commonplace as the innumerable summer shakespeare festivals that dot the american landscape in this country though the phrase "outdoor drama" also has a more specific meaning it refers to the history plays and religious dramas that are performed each summer in outdoor theaters all over america usually before audiences consisting of tourists these homespun productions are a significant part of the american theatrical scene i know any number of professional actors who spent a season or two performing in outdoor dramas early in their careers but for the most part they fly below the radar of big city drama critics its been years since i last saw one so i decided to pay a visit to north carolina where outdoor dramas are produced each year and find out what ive been missing not only is north carolina the undisputed capital of historical outdoor drama but its the home of the oldest such show paul greens "the lost colony " a freely fictionalized recounting of the saga of the english colonists who sailed to north carolinas roanoke island in made camp there and were never seen again virginia dare the first child born to english parents in the western hemisphere was one of them "the lost colony " which is celebrating its th anniversary this year is performed at a waterside amphitheater in the fort raleigh national historic site a park on the site of the roanoke colony its better known alumni include andy griffith and steve kazee now starring opposite audra mcdonald in the broadway revival of " in the shade " and the show remains one of north carolinas top tourist attractions green who died in is all but forgotten today but in the s and s he was one of americas best known playwrights ten of his shows made it to broadway including "in abrahams bosom " which won the pulitzer prize for drama and "johnny johnson " a musical on which he collaborated with kurt weill in by that time though his star was fading and he turned his attention to the writing of the outdoor dramas that became his chief pursuit some of which continue to be performed these works which green referred to as "symphonic dramas " blended speech song and broad brush populist pageantry in a way that served as a model for most of the historical outdoor dramas that followed them william ivey long a north carolina native turned broadway costume designer whose father directed "the lost colony" in the s redesigned the show in and greens floridly poetic text has also been quietly revised over the years to accommodate contemporary sensibilities it now contains for example a strategically placed reference to the "innocent indians" who are thought to have done away with the lost colonists but even in its present form "the lost colony" remains a wonderfully old fashioned period piece whose unabashed patriotism and frank religiosity are redolent of a long lost age of certitude "paul green has written history with a compassion that turns his characters into unconscious symbols of a brave new world mr greens wisdom is rooted in a poets love of a fair land " so wrote brooks atkinson the drama critic of the new york times in i wonder how many critics would feel moved to use such language today as a production "the lost colony" is well suited to its purpose the acting is uneven in quality but the primary color pageantry is resplendent running to vigorous crowd scenes a brief but spectacular fireworks display and some of the best looking stage snow ive ever seen the choral singing is sturdy the costumes properly elizabethan to see and hear such simple things under a starry summer sky is to be touched to the heart cherokee n c if its indisputably innocent indians you seek drive to the opposite end of north carolina where "unto these hills " americas third oldest outdoor drama has been playing since in a steeply raked stunningly beautiful rustic amphitheater carved out of the side of one of the great smoky mountains cherokee the tiny tourist town that serves as headquarters of the eastern band of the cherokee nation has evolved over the years into something resembling an indian theme park complete with an outdoor drama a museum a replica of an indian village and naturally a casino the "unto these hills" now being performed in cherokees mountainside theatre is not the same show my parents saw and loved a half century ago that show written by kermit hunter a protege of paul green who is briefly dismissed in the program of the current production as "a non native " was a traditional plot driven outdoor drama about one of the most shameful events in american history the forced removal of the cherokee nation from north carolina to oklahoma by the u s military in the new "unto these hills " unveiled last year and rewritten for this season jettisoned hunters script in favor of a less downbeat more historically accurate show in which a pair of cherokee oldsters tell their grandchildren tales of the past that are acted out by the person cast most of whose members are real life cherokees "whats that dance grandma " "its the bear dance the bear was a very important part of our culture " unlike its predecessor "unto these hills a retelling" is less a play than a pageant and as such does not fall under the usual purview of a drama critic most of the actors appear to be amateurs while the new script by pat allee and ben hurst is interesting mainly for the way in which it inverts the western movie cliches of the s portraying the white characters as well meaning dolts or snidely whiplash type monsters of greed "you will bring me your gold or die " the dances however are splendidly authentic and handsomely costumed and should you be spending a few days visiting the smokies youll find "unto these hills" a painless and pleasant way to learn a bit about cherokee history mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and
