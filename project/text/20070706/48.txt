mutual madness from all indications the sec is planning again to require that at least three quarters of every mutual fund board of directors be independent of the funds investment adviser the d c court of appeals has twice struck down this move because the agency failed to consider efficiency competition and capital formation as the law requires but even if the agency does so this time the new requirements wont be in the interests of investors still many readers may wonder why more independent directors arent good for investors the answer lies in the peculiar role of directors in approving the fees of investment advisers the system discourages price competition among advisers and keeps mutual fund costs higher than they should be heres how it works mutual funds are corporations legally controlled by boards of directors but managed under contracts by investment advisory firms that receive a fee for their advisory and management services mutual fund shares are sold at their net asset value nav that is the value of a proportionate share of the funds portfolio but the nav is reduced slightly by the advisers fees and costs of managing the fund under the investment company act of boards of directors must approve the fees and expenses of the investment adviser for each fund in order to obtain this approval the adviser submits its fees and expenses to the board and in most cases the board determines in light of these costs whether the advisers resulting profit is "reasonable " if this sounds familiar thats because this cost plus system is substantially the same as the way that electric rates are determined by local utility commissions as economic studies have shown however cost plus ratemaking creates no incentive for efficiency or cost cutting on the part of the regulated entity the same problem exists in mutual fund pricing the adviser has little incentive to lower its costs if it does so its profit percentage will rise and the board may require a cut in fees to keep the advisers profits within the range that the board considers reasonable in addition if the adviser takes the risk of reducing its costs and succeeds in attracting more investors the board may require the adviser to lower the advisory fee further because the adviser is now thought to be profiting from economies of scale this system by stunting the advisers incentive to cut costs reduces the likelihood that price competition will develop among advisers and that is precisely what we see when we look at mutual fund costs the mutual fund industry has a highly competitive structure with about fund groups managing &# trillion in assets through over funds yet there is a wide disparity in the costs paid by investors for advisory services to their funds among a sample of over ordinary equity funds listed in morningstar for example there is a difference of nearly between the lowest cost fund and the highest there are also disparities almost as wide among the largest and most competitive funds and fund groups these disparities do not correspond to performance and even exist among index funds where there can be no significant differences in performance the united kingdom presents an instructive contrast there investment advisers can establish their own fees without the intervention of a board of directors yet the dispersion of prices in a sample of more than equity mutual funds is much tighter than in the u s about one third the difference in the u s group also a lipper report compared the pricing of equity funds sponsored by six large u s fund managers that also sponsor equity funds in the u k the average cost for their advisory services in the u k differed in this study by not more than ten basis points while the difference was as much as basis points for their u s funds these comparisons suggest that the cost plus system in the u s is impairing the ability of mutual fund advisers to compete on price this is a significant public policy issue millions of american families rely on mutual funds for their retirement and even small differences in costs over time can have a major effect on investment results recognizing this the sec has attempted for over years to reduce the wide disparity in mutual fund pricing by empowering and increasing the independence of mutual fund boards this was supposed to give directors more leverage in negotiating fees with advisers this policy is a loser as the experience of regulated utilities shows it isnt the power of the rate maker thats important utility commissions have plenty of that but the fact that the regulated entity has no incentive to reduce its costs in the sec staff recommended eliminating the rate making authority of the mutual fund board of directors but the commission never acted on this proposal instead of plodding ahead with a failed solution increasing the independence of boards the sec should take seriously the year old recommendation of its own staff freeing investment advisers from the shackles of cost plus rate regulation will allow and encourage investment advisers to compete on price with the same effect for mutual fund advisory costs as the elimination of rate regulation has had for securities brokerage air fares and long distance telephone rates more competition more innovation and lower costs for the investing public mr wallison is a
