weekend journal tastings gold from italys hills italian whites are more than just pinot grigio an eye opening meal lets get right to the point were surprised to say this ourselves but you really should run out this weekend and buy a verdicchio from italy and then pick up some fish for dinner and if you dont see verdicchio get a gavi now lets start at the beginning when was the last time you had an italian white that wasnt pinot grigio in our youth we used to drink all sorts of whites from italy but it seems to us that they faded from consciousness over time as pinot grigio has ascended along with exciting white wines from all over the world like new zealands sauvignon blanc and austrias gruner veltliner most wine lovers we know go through phases one woman told us just the other day "i came back from germany and didnt drink anything but riesling for six months " these days with so many interesting wines on shelves sometimes we become so enchanted with new discoveries that we forget old friends so a couple of months ago we realized that it has been far too long since we paid serious attention to some italian whites we decided to choose three of our old friends and pay them a visit to see how theyre doing there are many italian whites of course but we were really curious about three vernaccia di san gimignano from tuscany verdicchio from le marche and gavi made from the cortese grape in piedmont we bought a large sampling of each from more than a dozen stores in four states and conducted blind tastings type against same type the vernaccia quickly fell by the wayside the wines were pleasant but not consistently good enough that they could muscle their way past all of the other outstanding whites on the shelves that doesnt mean there arent some fine examples out there but we werent impressed enough by our sample to get excited about them too many seemed like heavy water they were difficult to drink and their alcohol swamped what fruit they had but then there were the gavis and then there were the verdicchios they were certainly very different wines and well get back to that but it was interesting what they had in common tasting them we think we could understand how theyve been pushed to the background overall consumers seem to have settled on two fundamental profiles for their white wines big oaky and a bit sweet chardonnay or very clean crisp and juicy sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio gavi and verdicchio dont fit those profiles and actually taste in general more like the white wines of our youth they are more restrained happy to be supporting players at a meal instead of the star they have notable earthiness with an underpinning of minerals they are dry and they taste like grapes not like wood they taste real grounded and not at all frivolous all of this makes them perfect with food instead of wines to sip alone dottie said of them at some point "these are like a big warm grandma embrace as opposed to crisp and sharp theyre comfortable like grandmas lap " put another way at a moment when so many wines say "look at me " these say "hey lets eat " in fact they say that so clearly that in the middle of our tasting dottie said "can you imagine these with a grilled whole fish im going to make one " the problem was that while dottie orders whole fish at restaurants and is expert at filleting them at the table she had never grilled a whole fish we went to the local fish store found a gorgeous red snapper and got instructions from the owner put thin slices of lemon and some thyme inside the fish season and then cook it in foil on the grill for about a half hour dottie happy to cheat the rabbits and chipmunks that have been bedeviling her herb garden also put oregano basil parsley and sage into the fish because our daughter media had commandeered the dining room table to paint she was in the middle of a gorgeous scene with her her sister zoee and us dancing the fish cooked a little longer than minutes were happy to report that the snapper turned out perfectly even the girls admitted that it was the best fish theyd ever had although they were grossed out that the snapper looked back at them the eye opener for us though was what happened to the wine we had the fish with a flight of gavi the entire gavi tasting was a delight with wines that were often as bright as sunshine with a nice underlay of minerals and excellent balance but the sweet meat of the fish made the wines even better their earthiness became lustiness and the lemon of the fish and the acidity of the wine melded beautifully the pairing was a total delight to be sure the tastes of the gavi and the verdicchio were different the gavis were generally livelier brighter and more aromatic and some could even be enjoyed on their own as a sipping wine the overall quality of verdicchio was a marvelous surprise to us wine after wine was not only tasty but intense complex and interesting the wines had good fruit smells and tastes of minerals and then something extra a little bit of nuttiness especially on the finish and a tiny bit of bitterness that made us take note of each sip they were full but not heavy with a touch of white pepper and some peach we compared a couple of our favorites to chablis high praise indeed from us not because the tastes were the same but because they shared the same intensity focus purity and sense of place near the end of our tasting of the two wines dottie put our conclusion very simply "these deserve to make their way back onto the american table " how about tonight melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones verdicchio and gavi index in a broad blind tasting of verdicchio and gavi from italy these were our favorites buy the youngest you see our tasting indicated that you should certainly avoid anything older than gavi can be a good sipping wine and goes well with appetizers and lighter summertime dishes while verdicchio often is fuller with more bite and needs somewhat heavier food we generally found that these were better cooler because the tastes were more focused but note how much stronger the attractive mineral
