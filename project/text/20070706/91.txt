weekend journal review film transformers looks slick but is long murky plots debt to spielberg blethyns comic turn falls flat in dwights there are aliens among us or perhaps youve already heard they overstay their visit by minutes maybe even theyre several decibels louder than they might be and their story lacks a certain coherence still for almost two hours of car chases and car wrecks and extraordinary animated transformation sequences that meld fluidly with live action the welcome mat is out for michael bays cheerfully dopey saga inspired by the popular shape shifting toys from the s "transformers" centers on sam witwicky shia labeouf a high school junior whos about to buy his first set of wheels a beat up canary yellow camaro with racing stripes thats suddenly materialized at the used car lot this vehicle proves to have a mind of its own one minute playing annoyingly apt songs on the radio like "baby come back " as sam tries to woo his gorgeous classmate mikaela megan fox the next driving itself away and transforming into a giant robot elsewhere there are similarly strange occurrences u s soldiers in qatar have been set upon by a helicopter that flips into a vicious robot laying waste to everything in its path while a metallic off shoot transformer parthenogenesis hacks into top secret government files as is so often the case in movies as in life the whole thing boils down to good versus evil in this instance good transformers the autobots including optimus prime and bumblebee vs evil transformers the decepticons whose numbers include megatron both groups are desperately searching for allspark a cube thats their life source and sam unwittingly has a key clue now for assorted reasons pretty much everyone is after him mom dad evil transformers and a secret government group led by the terrific john turturro as the square root of empty suit officiousness "try to keep up with the acronyms " he snaps at one point the story line middle class kid from a seemingly idyllic suburban outpost dealing with creatures from another planet and creatures from d c owes a debt to the early work of steven spielberg one of the movies executive producers the transformers are admittedly far less interesting as robots than they are as vehicles and the climactic throw down is protracted and uninvolving still there are compensations and theyre not inconsiderable among them the witty references to "e t " to outsourcing in india to the superiority of japanese made goods not to mention allusions to to a certain online auction site youd be surprised to learn just whos shopping on ebay introducing the dwights stand up comics as portrayed in movies are an icky bunch theyre unreliable undependable and when their jokes fall flat really vile to be around whether this is an accurate depiction is a matter perhaps best left to members of the friars club in any case it nicely sums up jean dwight brenda blethyn adding another domineering needy mother role to her resume the gale force who animates the awkwardly fused comedy drama "introducing the dwights " jean a one time rising stand up star is trying to resuscitate the career she unwittingly kissed goodbye years ago when she left her native england to follow her then husband john frankie j holden to australia failed country singer john is himself a one hit wonder long ago he had a chart topper for three weeks two weeks corrects jean custodial parent of their two twenty something children tim khan chittenden whos socially awkward and chronically mortified by his mother and mark richard wilson who suffered brain damage at birth but frequently offers up jarringly precocious and hilarious observations the three of them impressively hold their own on screen with ms blethyn jean who has the coarseness if not the contours of the late totie fields makes ends meet with a cafeteria job and makes do with gigs at fourth rate dives sample greeting to the crowd "ladies and genitalia fondling enthusiasts " sample joke "the youngest wants a dog i said we are not having your father back " ba dum jeans material is so flat out awful its amazing she gets hired at all let alone that she once supposedly had headliner potential its a discrepancy that "introducing the dwights" never addresses complications arise when tim falls hard for a flirtatious and sexually forthright blonde the very good emma booth and isnt always immediately available to schlep his mother around to club dates and auditions and to mind his brother jean deals with this incursion much as she would a roomful of drunken hecklers badly and with a liquor bottle her subsequent meltdown is unpleasant to watch the cuddly all is forgiven wrap up unearned license to wed the outtakes of "license to wed" show cast members mandy moore john krasinski and robin williams giggling chortling and quite clearly having a rousing good time this is a very nice thing to see someone should have fun even if it isnt the audience the very appealing ms moore who has the same bad luck with films "because i said so " to cite a recent example as her characters have with romance here plays sadie jones newly engaged to ben murphy mr krasinski the velveeta bland ben wants to get married on the beach meanwhile the very strong minded take charge sadie wants to tie the knot at st augustines the church where her grandfather built the front door and where her parents said their own "i dos" years ago its also the church whose spiritual leader reverend frank robin williams has some very unorthodox notions these include conducting sunday school classes like game shows and insisting that only couples who take and pass his marriage prep class a sort of boot camp for the betrothed can be married at st augustines heres rule no participants must write their own vows heres rule no no sex before the honeymoon sadie willingly and ben reluctantly agree to the terms and sign up for the program but rest assured reverend frank isnt taking their adherence to his doctrine on faith in a scene that blends the illegal with the unsavory he dispatches his pre teen assistant choir boy josh flitter to bug the couples bedroom so he can monitor sounds of hanky panky for better or worse the name robin williams in a movies cast list suggests a high antic farcical content at the very least it suggests funny in this case its false advertising the inert "license to wed" shambles along one lame scene after another watch the couple in a role playing exercise that shows how quickly matrimony can become acrimony watch them in an "are you ready for parenthood " assessment featuring robot babies that vomit yowl and soil themselves then again perhaps they were demonstrating a precocious aptitude for film commentary dvd tip the radiant elizabeth taylor gets engaged and spencer tracy tries wonderfully futilely to get a grip in "father of the bride "
