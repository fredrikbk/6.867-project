study of kids brains hopes to answer what is normal every parent knows that children have minds of their own shaped by growing brains that scientists can barely fathom researchers strain to tell symptoms of neural disorder from the natural variations of young brains almost infinite in their possibilities this summer brain experts funded by the national institutes of health are finishing the largest systematic clinical study ever of the neurobiology of youth in a &# million project researchers in six cities have been combining brain scans psychological profiles medical exams and intelligence tests gathered from hundreds of healthy children to answer a fundamental question about brain development that nags parents and pediatric practitioners alike what is normal when completed this nih brain archive promises to become the first clinical benchmark by which normal development can be judged matching behavior to brain anatomy from birth through adolescence with it specialists should be able to understand better problems such as autism in which neural miscues undermine the mind educators bedeviled by child rearing fads and untested teaching theories should be able to match alterations in brain structure to the rise and fall of learning skills "once we know the map we can tell what nudges the brain for good or ill " said nih brain imaging expert jay giedd by any standard every childs brain is an experiment from a single cell in the womb it swells at such speed cells a minute that by early childhood it has more neurons and nerves connecting them than do any older wiser adults it is buffeted by tumultuous bursts of growth that prime it for mastering new skills and ways of thinking yet so little is certain about how it changes throughout childhood that scientists dont know what ought to be expected said cornell university expert b j casey who helped pioneer brain imaging in children not only is every new brain different from any other but the variations within each one as it adapts swells and contracts confound analysis "a developing brain looks weird " said pediatric neurologist katrina gwinn at the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke who directs the nih project "something that might be normal in an adult might look abnormal in a child " until recently little was known about how normal human brains change as they grow because conventional medical imaging techniques were too dangerous or invasive to be used with any but the sickest children the nih survey takes advantage of newer techniques benign enough that infants can safely nap inside while their brain cells are bombarded with magnetic pulses seeking as broad a measure of childhood as possible research teams in boston philadelphia cincinnati st louis los angeles and houston selected girls and boys from among families to ensure that the data would reflect the countrys racial ethnic and economic diversity "so many studies are done only with white kids from suburban areas " said dr gwinn "we worked hard to get different demographics " researchers even sought the proper mix of right and left handers the children between six and years old were screened to ensure they were free of illness genetic predispositions prenatal risk factors toxic environmental exposures or chronic health problems that might affect their brains "these are really healthy brains " said project researcher deborah waber at childrens hospital boston newborns have since been included in the study the children were scanned periodically using three techniques structural magnetic resonance imaging to catch changes in the brains gray matter which contains neurons diffusion tensor imaging to monitor its white matter of connecting nerve fibers and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to track the ups and downs of brain chemistry to match changes in brain anatomy to mental abilities the youngsters also regularly took tests of iq dexterity spatial ability memory and cognitive skills "so we are actually able to follow individual children and look at snapshots of the same brain over time " said dr waber in its essence this biomedical mosaic is a national portrait of the child mind it reveals that gender differences and income disparities matter less than previously believed and that health matters more project researchers reported recently in the journal of the international neuropsychological society healthy girls and boys do equally well on most cognitive tasks boys perform better at analyzing and manipulating shapes and patterns while girls perform better on processing speed and motor dexterity no differences were measured in calculation ability suggesting boys and girls have an equal aptitude for math by age many children are as proficient as adults by most measures of mental performance these unusually fit diverse children outperformed all those in previous research on tests that measured iq memory reading and math ability and development of social skills it may be years before the findings have been fully analyzed and applied until then the nih brain project like the children it documents is a promise of things to come email me at
