for valentino gala of all galas at villa borghese the designers consigliere throws a party in rome as a fashion era ends rome giancarlo giammetti fretted over the seating chart for tomorrows luminous gala dinner in rome to celebrate italian fashion designer valentino garavani across from the colosseum an ancient roman temple dedicated to venus the goddess of love has been partially rebuilt in mr garavanis honor an arena size tent has been put up in the villa borghese gardens to host a dinner and ball on saturday night for more than guests a fleet of chauffeured cars will shuttle guests through the narrow streets of rome "who do i put there mick jagger or uma thurman or sarah jessica parker " mr giammetti asked out loud two of the dinners most anticipated guests actresses gwyneth paltrow and meryl streep had just canceled upsetting the careful seating arrangements mr giammetti had been preparing for weeks "acts of god " he grumbled for nearly half a century mr giammetti has worked quietly behind the scenes and at the side of mr garavani one of the worlds most celebrated designers when mr garavani sketched his floor sweeping red gowns mr giammetti measured the fabric after the designers catwalk bows mr giammetti took orders backstage and as the italian label grew mr giammetti poured the profits into lavish art collections and parties that glorified his partners name this week mr giammetti has been feverishly at work on a project he considers his masterpiece the th anniversary celebration of the valentino fashion house the three day event which kicks off in rome today could be the last big celebration for both men though the year old mr garavani is the star of the celebration mr giammetti is taking the credit "im not trying to take his spotlight " mr giammetti said during a recent interview in his cavernous office near the spanish steps "but i do feel like this celebration is a bit mine " and yet the grand feast could have a bittersweet end just as the event promises to further enshrine mr garavanis legacy its also a reminder of mr giammettis waning influence for decades some of the worlds most celebrated designers have kept a business savvy consigliere at their side who acted as both a guardian and manager so that the designers could maintain their creative focus giorgio armani relied on his former partner sergio galeotti to handle the labels business affairs until mr galeottis heart attack death in french designer yves saint laurent counted on his onetime lover pierre berge to finance and manage the label but as the fashion industry has succumbed to big business theres little room left for such counselors valentino which was recently taken over by a private equity firm has hired a new chief executive to manage the business affairs over which mr giammetti once reigned the upheaval hasnt distracted mr giammetti from his mission of the moment throwing a party that is as seamless as mr garavanis sumptuous gowns for the past two years the designers silver haired sidekick who is has been planning out every detail of the event at first mr giammetti was working on a modest one day event centered around mr garavanis haute couture show on saturday michele norsa the labels then ceo had been "not very generous" with the purse strings mr giammetti says so he couldnt stretch his imagination much further but when mr norsa suddenly left the company last year mr giammetti took advantage of the power vacuum to expand the scope of the festivities by the time a new ceo arrived months later mr giammetti had committed company money to financing a &# restoration of the ancient foundations of the temple of venus he had also hired set designer dante ferretti to erect corridors of towering fiberglass columns on top of the restored foundations the temple will be the site of a red carpet cocktail party tonight over the past few days the preparations have gathered pace mr giammetti has taken his laptop to bed to analyze and rearrange the dinners seating charts for celebrities ranging from mick jagger to princess caroline of monaco finalizing the seating arrangement has been a major headache ms paltrow had broken her knee while ms streep had to fly to stockholm to meet with members of pop group abba mr giammetti said she is to star in the movie version of "mamma mia " the broadway musical based on the groups music the two actresses were to have been seated near mr valentino so the diagram had to be carefully redone mr giammettis staff lined a conference room next to his office with little pink disks representing tables to help mr giammetti visualize the battlefield earlier that day mr giammetti toured the grounds of the ara pacis an ancient roman altar that will host a retrospective of mr garavanis designs clad in an impeccably cut chocolate colored suit mr giammetti agonized over a patch of ugly mold that clung to the surface of a nearby fountain specialists need to be called in immediately mr giammetti said mr giammettis attention to detail has helped drive the valentino label from the start mr garavani actually founded the fashion house not years ago in but the brand did not begin to flourish until the designer met mr giammetti then in his early s in a rome cafe on the glamorous via veneto in at the time mr giammetti was pursuing a degree in architecture and had no ambitions to plunge into fashion a romance between the two men which mr giammetti acknowledged but declined to discuss blossomed in the years that followed mr giammetti became the designers deal maker negotiating distribution of valentinos creations with top u s department stores and crafting lucrative licensing agreements for perfumes and other accessories he would fly around the world making sure women ranging from elizabeth taylor to jacqueline kennedy wore valentinos elegant and luxurious designs mr garavani and mr giammetti "are like two souls in the same body " said mr norsa the former valentino ceo mr giammetti has been the designers alter ego in both substance and style the consigliere rises at a m to scan the newspapers for coverage of the designer mr garavani rolls out of bed around and never reads the newspaper "he was the gentleman who kept me away from all the problems and antipathy " the bronzed designer mused yesterday while touring the partially reconstructed temple of venus mr garavani had recently flown in from paris where he had been prepping models expected to walk in his saturday couture show here photographers and fashion press swarmed around the designer off on the side mr giammetti stood in the afternoon sun occasionally glancing at his watch all week mr giammetti has been studying the skies of rome for any signs of rain that might spoil the celebrations "im praying " he said
