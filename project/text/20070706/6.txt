partnership is no longer a tenured position more law firms thin ranks of partners to boost profits attract keep high earners most lawyers set on pursuing careers in elite firms have long focused on one goal making partner now they are adding a second one staying partner earlier this year chicago based mayer brown rowe &amp maw llp fired or demoted partners about of the equity partnership to help improve profitability jenner &amp block llp a large firm based in chicago and powell goldstein llp a midsize firm based in atlanta also recently demoted or fired partners once rare quiet and restricted to the most competitive firms "de equitization" has become one of the most popular buzz words in law firm management as corporate firms across the country with ambitions to grow and boost profits have aggressively and publicly thinned their partner ranks the word has stoked a new sense of vulnerability among lawyers "in the last months there have been more demotions among elite firms in chicago than perhaps in any prior period " says mark jungers the head of the midwest partner practice for recruiting firm major lindsey &amp africa llc alan rubinstein the executive vice president of chicago legal search ltd says the top firms in the city used to demote partners piecemeal but "the newer phenomenon is that firms are doing this wholesale " the pressure comes not so much from economic weakness in the industry but strength with the vitality of public company mergers and private equity takeovers many areas of corporate practice are booming and firms are eager to keep and attract partners with rich client lists in those fields and it takes sizzling profits per partner to retain and lure those stars peter zeughauser a law firm consultant in newport beach calif says firms increasingly want to promote their tough minded approach to penalizing underperformers "there is much less of a stigma attached to it than even five years ago " he says "more and more firms realize you need to send a message to the market that you are a hard working firm " as james holzhauer the chairman of mayer brown said in an interview shortly after the demotions and firings at his firm "we want to drive our stock price up " in the traditional law firm associates are the employees and partners are the business owners who run the firm and share in its gains and losses the expectation had always been that if associates worked like pack mules for seven or eight years the stars among them would have a shot at being anointed an "equity partner " who derives his or her income largely from the firms profits now that climb has not only gotten longer often nine years or more but the ladder once climbed can be yanked away "partnership is no longer a tenured position " says michael boone a member of the board of dallas based haynes &amp boone llp a lawyer firm that has at times demoted partners or has asked them to leave "you have to get up every monday morning and prove yourself all over again " meanwhile many firms in recent years raised salaries for associates for example first year associates can make &# a year at elite firms to pay those raises while still sustaining or increasing their profitability figures firms must crack the whip even harder on partners it has also become more imperative to prod partners to land business because client loyalties have eroded lawyers say "in the past partners inherited legal work" from clients that had long relationships with their firm says mr boone nowadays individual partners need to find their own clients he says lawyers who cant generate sufficient business often must pick up midcareer and move to smaller often less prestigious firms that have lower overhead and more muted earning demands but also pay partners less particularly hard hit have been lawyers specializing in real estate employment trusts and estates and other areas where either competition limits firms from charging higher rates on routine matters or the work doesnt require hordes of associates to bill hours and generate profits for the firm david richards a real estate lawyer in new york says he had been at the firm now known as sidley austin llp for years when he was demoted in "it was surprising and hurtful " he says "i thought i had been a good soldier " he was allowed to remain at the firm until the end of in a reduced capacity he is now a partner at a smaller firm mccarter &amp english llp where he says there is less pressure to bill at high rates "mccarter is more sympathetic to middle market practices and rates than a large firm trying to keep up its stock price " he says "formerly firms tolerated lulls now they dont " says mr richards the equal employment opportunity commission filed a lawsuit in alleging that mr richards and other sidley partners were victims of age discrimination a sidley spokeswoman declined to comment the suit is still pending avoiding litigation or even bad blood is just part of the delicate dance firms go through when demoting or firing lawyers partnership agreements usually require a vote of all the partners before one of their own can be demoted or fired but most often the decisions are made by firms executive committees in deals worked out with the targeted partners according to lawyers while firms want to signal theyre on board with what are perceived to be sound law firm management practices of maintaining profit margins they dont want to upset partners and associates about the firms health and individuals employment prospects the fear is "people will say if partnership is no longer tenured ill be like a free agent baseball player and see what the market will pay " says dan dipietro managing director with the law firm group of citi private bank a unit of citigroup inc last year eileen trost says she left chicagos sonneschein nath &amp rosenthal llp because she worried she could soon be asked to leave as had some of her fellow trust and estates partners trusts and estates "is a practice with profit issues because individuals are paying your bills and are more sensitive to costs than corporations " says ms trost who moved to a smaller chicago firm "i have enough stress from my work i dont need the stress of worrying i might be fired because im not working enough hours " while some partners get asked to leave others are demoted allowed to remain if they are believed to still add value they may be technically skilled for example but mediocre at attracting clients a firm might let them keep their partner title but remove or drastically reduce their equity in the firm with an eye to boosting the firms average profits per equity partner in a widely watched survey conducted by industry trade magazine american lawyer the magazines survey shows that nonequity partnerships are growing both because of demotions and as a way station for those on their way up as for mayer brown the partner purge was disruptive at first say current and former partners the firm has long been known as "mother mayer " an unusually genteel place that was loath to punish partners when their practices slowed but lawyers there are adjusting to the new reality say jonathan asperger the firms former marketing director who left last year but keeps in touch with people at the firm a firm spokeswoman declined to comment "mayer sent a message to all lawyers including associates that partnership is not a pinnacle " says mr asperger who is now a marketing consultant to law firms "partners are expected to continue to climb by either bringing in new business or developing skills for which there is a strong market demand " corrections &amp amplifications alan rubenstein is executive vice president of chicago legal search ltd a july marketplace
