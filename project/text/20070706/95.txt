weekend journal taste de gustibus in the world of womens wear sense and sensibility the washington post last week when designer liz claiborne died at the age of thousands of american women mourned and rightly so as one appreciative customer wrote to a few days ago "liz attire was a go to for presentations applying for the first car loan and nervously sitting in the deans office trying to worm my way into grad school " starting in the s ms claiborne was responsible for providing legions of working women with attire that was feminine affordable easy to care for and most important "appropriate " a term the new ceo of ann taylor kay krill says she has now embraced alas few clothing designers and retailing executives and not enough clothing wearers have adopted ms claibornes sensibilities to take one example a researcher at npd group a marketing firm recently told the journal that lingerie stock now changes with the seasons since many younger women today are not embarrassed to be "wearing inner wear as outerwear " but at least one woman is leading the good fight against such tasteless trends stacy london is not a clothing designer but she does have a popular television show on the tlc network called "what not to wear " and along with her co star clinton kelly she helps women from across the country find clothing thats appropriate appropriate for their age for their body type and for the occasion "you dont want to show too much skin at work unless youre a lifeguard " ms london tells me in one of her trademark one liners shes not mean to the shows guests but her bluntness does seem to make it difficult for them to forget her point the women on the show targeted by family and friends for wardrobe interventions submit to this trashing of their taste and a tossing of their closets contents in exchange for a &# shopping spree in new york under the close watch of ms london and mr kelly "theres something much worse than showing too much leg " she explains "its looking like youre chasing your youth " ms london acknowledges that avoiding this problem is even more difficult for women today than it was when ms claiborne started designing we live in "a culture obsessed with youth " even a show like "desperate housewives " which is ostensibly about somethings reinforces this message since most of the women dress like theyre ms london who is and trim says she herself had trouble finding clothes this season "everything was a minidress or a babydoll it looks ridiculous for me to try to wear these " she wants women to do more than cover up though shes trying to slow what she calls the "casualization of america " on more than one episode of "what not to wear " ms london and mr kelly have had to lecture guests on why pajamas are not acceptable attire outside of the house "if i have to get dressed to go out in the morning so do you " she tries to convince them for this trend which also encompasses various other bits of far too casual attire ms london blames not only womens laziness but also the fashion industry she cites a marc jacobs collection that came out in while she was working at vogue "grunge became a revolutionary fashion statement everything was a little sloppy a little homeless " and unfortunately she notes "it took too long for the pendulum to swing back to elegance " in general ms london says she finds the world of fashion "rarefied " "who wears pvc bodysuits to work " she wonders referring to a kind of plastic typically reserved for home construction and repair given her attitude its not surprising that ms london says she never quite "fit in" in the fashion world but how did she come to such judgments in the first place ms london studied german and philosophy at vassar writing a senior thesis on heidegger and nietzsche both she jokes had strong personal fashion bents ultimately though she gives much credit to her father herb london conservative social critic and president of the hudson institute for her attitudes "we dont see eye to eye on that much politically " she acknowledges but "he did instill a certain sense of propriety and right and wrong in me which plays into my fashion sensibility " so much credit does ms london give her dad she calls him "the best father in the world" that she has invited him to be on her new show "shut up its stacy london " premiering on tlc in october "hes going to be the dad correspondent " she tells me hell be offering "the dads perspective" on particular items of clothing and fashion trends in other words one imagines no "inner wear as outerwear " ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
