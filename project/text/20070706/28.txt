foreign investors face new hurdles across the globe china canada russia grow wary of acquirers risk for multinationals governments from canada to china have imposed or are considering restrictions on foreign purchases of companies factories and real estate in their countries moves u s officials fear could harm global economic growth if they proliferate the measures include bureaucratic and legal barriers to so called foreign direct investment in which foreigners buy a countrys physical assets such as mines or other property rather than investing in the country indirectly through its stock or bond markets so far the restrictions havent slowed the massive flows of investment capital sloshing around the globe in fact foreign direct investment is booming but u s officials are concerned because for the first time in decades barriers to it are rising instead of falling a trend that could be especially painful for multinational companies in china new regulations let officials block foreign acquisitions of chinese companies if they deem them a danger to "economic security " in russia the government is considering limits on foreign ownership in "strategic" sectors of the economy including natural resource deposits and biotechnology canada one of the u s s largest trading partners is weighing stricter rules on who can buy its companies in reaction to a flurry of foreign takeovers including last years acquisition of canadian steelmaker dofasco inc by arcelor sa of france it isnt clear to what extent new restrictions might deter foreign buyers but in at least a few cases foreign bidders have been forced to settle for minority stakes in their acquisition targets in china for example u s private equity firm carlyle group had to scale back its bid for a controlling stake in yangzhou chengde steel tube co and in italy telefonica sa of spain had to team up with three italian financial institutions to buy telecom italia after italys prime minister declared that the telecom company should "remain in italian hands " the new wariness toward foreign acquirers reflects a variety of factors including the perception that the u s the worlds largest recipient of foreign direct investment is erecting new barriers to foreign capital it also comes amid a broader backlash against globalization fueled in part by popular concerns that trade has hurt many of the worlds lower skilled workers and has contributed to job losses and stagnant wages particularly in rich countries political firestorms erupted in the u s last year when a dubai owned company tried to buy operations at five american ports and the year before when state owned chinese oil company cnooc ltd tried to buy california based oil giant unocal corp both deals were ultimately scuttled amid the uproar which prompted congress to pass legislation to subject foreign investments to closer scrutiny by the committee on foreign investment in the u s or cfius an interagency council that screens foreign purchases of u s assets with national security implications that legislation is likely to reach president bushs desk this month "there are examples of countries even probably the u s where they have taken actions which had the either intended or unintended consequences of blocking transactions and that causes other countries to restrict investment " says william parrett chairman of the u s council for international business which lobbies for free trade and who was until recently chief executive of accounting firm deloitte touche tohmatsu the risks are greatest for u s multinational corporations they typically conduct a majority of their overseas business through foreign affiliates rather than through sales of exported goods made in the u s in the latest year for which data are available u s based multinationals exported goods valued at &# billion but sold goods valued at &# trillion through foreign affiliates according to the u s bureau of economic analysis "this really matters because u s headquartered multinational firms serve foreign markets overwhelmingly through sales in their foreign affiliates not through exports from the united states " says matthew slaughter an economist with dartmouth colleges tuck school of business those foreign affiliates typically produce products locally relying on local production sites and raw materials as well as easy access to local customers while conceding that globalization creates losers as well as winners its proponents fear the political reaction could disrupt the decades long trend toward more open economies that has helped spur u s economic growth and hold down inflation "perhaps the greatest challenge is rising investment protectionism and we have got to work very hard to keep investment barriers low " says u s deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt who recently visited moscow and beijing to urge officials to minimize restrictions on foreign investment mr kimmitt and other u s officials say the u s has crafted a reasonable review process for foreign backed deals and that in only of them were subjected to special scrutiny the chinese restrictions already have had an impact carlyle group had planned to take a majority position in yangzhou chengde steel tube but was limited to a minority holding after china cited yangzhou as a strategic asset and raised concerns about a foreign company gaining control of it china cited similar concerns in blocking a bid by germanys schaeffler group a maker of automotive components to acquire luoyang bearing corp group chinese regulators also just rejected an effort by carlyle to acquire an stake in chongqing commercial bank co saying it didnt meet regulatory requirements india and germany are considering national security screening processes for proposed foreign investments similar to those in the u s germany is considering legislation to make it more difficult for foreign government controlled investment funds to acquire german companies india has already rejected an investment from a chinese telecommunications company some politicians and industry groups in japan are agitating for national security reviews bolivia is nationalizing its oil and gas sector canadian leaders like their counterparts elsewhere say they are responding to national security concerns about foreign government owned entities buying canadian natural resources and other assets "we may have to give special attention when we see situations where directly or indirectly state owned enterprises or agencies of state owned enterprises are proposing to make substantial foreign investment in canada " canadian finance minister james flaherty said in an interview "we are conscious of the need to protect our own national security and also to make sure overall substantial investment in canada is in the net benefit of canada " he added none of the new measures has caused a major disruption in cross border deals there were cross border mergers and acquisitions last year up from in and the highest since the peak of according to thomson financial total world wide foreign direct investment reached &# billion in up from according to the united nations conference on trade and development but there has been a noticeable tightening the u n conference found that in the most recent year for which data are available "the number of changes making a host country less welcoming to fdi was the highest ever recorded by unctad " in that year countries made policy changes related to foreign investment with ranked as "less favorable" to foreign investment up from in "there is a chill on the margins in investment and i have seen deals that would have gone forward two years ago not go forward today because of regulatory and political uncertainty " says david marchick a partner with the u s law firm of covington &amp burling who advises companies on foreign investment issues some countries including china arent just emulating the u s by screening proposed foreign investments for national security conflicts but also are evaluating deals on "economic security" grounds "a number of countries have put the world on notice that they are putting in place measures that are supposed to emulate cfius however it is pretty clear that these processes go a step beyond by creating what is akin to a screening process that looks widely at industries as opposed to a national security process that looks narrowly at risks of specific transactions " says clay lowery acting u s treasury undersecretary for international affairs u s government officials and business executives alarmed by the rising political backlash to globalization and in particular foreign investment are arguing to foreign governments that while national security is important erecting barriers will chill investment in their homelands and potentially hurt their ability to invest abroad "reciprocity is not a factor that cfius considers however investments take place inside a broader political context and the degree to which american companies are afforded access to investment opportunities in countries abroad will be related to the opportunities available to their companies in the u s " says mr kimmitt the deputy treasury secretary
