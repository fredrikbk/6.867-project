mbas make it their business to improve school systems naomi shaefer riley wrote a one sided portrayal of the experience of business leaders in public education "another school dropout " taste page weekend journal june the more interesting story is not why one stellar business executive left an urban school district to return to the world of commerce but rather why dozens of these young superstars are going into school districts and staying in education careers the broad residency for urban education is a two year management training program that recruits recent mbas public policy and law school graduates who have several years of work experience and places them in high level management positions in urban school districts across the country now in its fourth year our program includes broad residents in school districts and charter management organizations and we have just selected the class of broad residents we hear time and time again from the superintendents who hire these residents that they are desperate for business talent professionals who understand budgeting human resource systems technology needs and have a track record of getting things done while many broad residents are quickly promoted within their school districts before the end of the two year program what is striking is that of the participants in the first three graduating classes have remained in education careers the work is challenging the bureaucracy can be frustrating the mixed talent pool in urban school districts is often surprising but the work that these young leaders are doing designing zero based budgeting systems increasing the responsiveness of business operations departments revamping human resource systems overseeing complicated school accountability programs is absolutely critical to ensuring that school districts are operated effectively with an eye toward the end goal improving student achievement for all children lynn liao senior director the broad residency in urban education los angeles i was a classmate of barak ben gals in the broad residency program i have enormous respect for him and the work he did in oakland but its worth noting that of the members of our class only two have left education few private sector firms can boast a retention rate of high achieving well credentialed mbas and jds many mbas are choosing to work in urban school districts where they can affect significant immediate and lasting change that affects the lives of students and the lives of everyone in our cities after receiving my mba from harvard business school i could have easily returned to investment banking or private equity instead i chose to use my skills to help improve the quality of education for inner city children the broad residency in urban education provided me with the perfect opportunity to help bring about the organizational changes necessary to improve academic results for students as assistant superintendent for human resources in boston public schools i have been tasked with transforming human capital management practices for schools and nearly employees to ensure that we hire and retain outstanding talent in the past three years my team and i have streamlined teacher recruiting and hiring begun a new teacher support system reorganized hr staff to better support schools and implemented new technology to reduce paperwork and bureaucracy the results include expanded numbers of teacher applicants improvements in the retention of new teachers and dramatic increases in principal and employee satisfaction with hr services ultimately these changes will have a positive impact on student performance the work has not been easy do i still hit up against bureaucracy and resistance to change absolutely are some systems still obsolete and procedures overly complicated you bet but what i see is an enormous opportunity to put my business experience into practice in an organization where i can make a significant impact the results my team and i have achieved so far have only served to further reinforce my commitment to this important work michelle boyers assistant superintendent for human resources boston public schools boston
