politics &amp economics china seems poised to pass u s as top greenhouse gas emitter beijing china is set to surpass the u s as the worlds top emitter of greenhouse gases this year much earlier than forecast because of its rapid economic growth according to the international energy agency moreover beijings refusal to put limits on chinas greenhouse gas emissions will allow them to increase nearly unchecked and erase gains made elsewhere in the world the ieas chief economist fatih birol said in an interview that could seriously weaken efforts to design a global greenhouse gas treaty to replace the kyoto protocol the iea which advises developed countries on energy policy previously had predicted chinas emissions of greenhouse gases would surpass those of the u s by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are released by burning fossil fuels and are believed by most climate scientists to cause or at least contribute to global warming but the iea revised its forecast on china because of the countrys surging economy mr birol said "in the past couple of months economic growth and related coal consumption has grown at such an unexpected rate " he said chinas economy has expanded more than a year for four straight years last week the government announced that gross domestic product expanded in the first quarter from a year earlier raising fears of excess in the economy mr birol said chinas increasing carbon dioxide emissions which stem from its near total reliance on domestic coal to power its economy are expected to dwarf reductions in emissions from europe the u s and japan unchecked over the next years the growth of chinas greenhouse gas emissions is forecast to double that of all the members of the organization for economic cooperation and development which includes europe the u s canada south korea and japan the assessment comes as china had been expected to release today its strategic plan for dealing with the impact of climate change but the release of the long expected report now appears to have been delayed according to an official at the national development and reform commission chinas top economic policy planning body the official declined to say why the report has been delayed though china is a signatory to the kyoto protocol it has been exempted from the treatys greenhouse gas limits because it is a developing country "without having china on board without having them play a significant role all these efforts none of it will make any sense " mr birol said chinas abundant supplies of locally mined coal are burned in thousands of power plants over the next years the iea forecasts china will add the equivalent of an entire european unions worth of power plants chinas leaders say that since the major developed economies grew rich using their own cheap energy also mostly coal china should have the same privilege they say any caps would brake economic growth force china to slow its development and keep its billion citizens needlessly impoverished still concerns about global warming are rising according to a chinese government report issued late last year crop output could fall to by if temperatures rise rising sea levels by could increase floods along the deltas of the yellow yangtze and pearl rivers the areas that support the bulk of chinas manufacturing and export might critics say chinas economic growth wont matter if global warming destroys arable land floods major coastal cities and evaporates chinas already dangerously low water supplies china has worked to increase energy efficiency and has said it wants an active role in developing a post kyoto framework ned helme president of the washington based center for clean air policy a nonprofit group that has been working with china on its plans to curb greenhouse gases said it is "a myth" that china is ignoring global warming a combination of efforts to modernize its industries and power plants and to impose tougher automobile efficiency standards he said will provide cuts roughly equal to president bushs plan to slow the growth of u s emissions by moreover mr helme said china is forcing its power plants to use more wind and hydroelectric power than u s utilities do sue feng in beijing and john fialka in washington contributed to this article
