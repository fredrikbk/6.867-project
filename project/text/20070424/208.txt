the game dr zs chrysler predicament selling unions on sacrifice forget about making better cars or even about the rise of private equity the best way to understand the sale of chrysler group is as blood sport between parent daimlerchrysler and its north american unions is daimlerchrysler willing to get fully ruthless with its employees in spite of its well hewn image as loveable corporate citizen the answer will make for some gripping theater in the months ahead that is because this deal really is about persuading the companys unions to roll back their own health and pension benefits the stock market already is acting like an agreement is nigh having added &# billion in value to daimler since the auto maker said it was considering a sale but the market underestimates just what rough business this separation is going to be "if people buying it think theyre going to get concessions out of us its not going to happen " said buzz hargrove head of the canadian auto workers union in an interview to first approach the problem it is best to consider the year old chrysler group less like a car company and more like a hard luck case the company carries an estimated &# billion in unfunded health care and other benefit costs all of which weigh heavily on the business "they clearly have to do something different than what theyre doing now " says paul walser owner of the walser chrysler jeep dealership in hopkins minn "its not working " piled on when the u s auto industry was far more dominant these costs erode what little profit the company can turn in the past five years chryslers &# billion in operating profit actually morphed into a &# billion loss when factoring in these payments it is why many bankers say the companys value is a fraction of the &# billion price daimler originally paid in fact they say this bundle of liabilities is worth zero things could well turn around but daimler has made it clear it doesnt have the patience it wants a sale fast "unless the united auto workers is willing to modernize the workplace and abandon its class warfare labor negotiations its impossible to run the company " argues peter morici a university of maryland business professor and longtime critic of the auto unions daimler suffers from a rich mans conundrum the profits at its other divisions continue to subsidize chrysler the uaw did grant some historic concessions to general motors and ford motor last year but those were for companies that were truly on the brink daimlerchrysler simply isnt so why should the unions sacrifice daimlers answer is clear to scare the heck out of the union by separating it from daimler the very idea of separation any separation already has proved a windfall for daimlers stock there is no turning back now but for this gambit to work daimlerchryslers chief executive dieter zetsche will have to prove exactly the opposite of the affable avuncular character he played in his companys own television commercials consider his predicament a buyer isnt going to take on chrysler without some guarantees of reduced worker costs either daimler can hang on to those costs invalidating the purpose of the whole exercise or the new buyers have to coax the workers into giving something up prospective private equity bidders blackstone group centerbridge capital partners and ceberus capital management are considering trading workers hard benefit checks for much murkier stock of a newly split chrysler that has yet to inspire much joy and who can blame them the unions typically value such equity at zero according to a person who has worked with their bargaining committees in the past the best bet might come from canadian car parts concern magna international inc which at least has a tradeable stock that is easy to value and is said to be the preferred option for the unions "were not interested in equity " mr hargrove said "weve met the test in terms of quality productivity and are not about to give it aint going to happen with our union " expect the unions to be especially resistant once the personal wealth of blackstone founder stephen a schwarzman is revealed when that firm files more detailed initial public offering documents that number could top a flabbergasting &# billion not exactly an owner who compels one to accept a smaller paycheck this is where dr zetsches ruthlessness will be put to the test if the unions wont budge he might have to ratchet up the threats to get them to the bargaining table these threats could be everything from a piecemeal break up to closing large parts of the company or even a bankruptcy filing whether reasonable or not such threats ring hollow coming from a company with the both the profits and imprimatur of mercedes benz no one feels sorry for the guy in the s sedan this will make it very hard for dr zetsche to really pressure the companys u s unions and run the risk of alienating the companys german workers too daimler probably will find a willing buyer for chrysler but doing so will likely mean it taking on the bulk of the liabilities it thought it was shedding in the first place cest la guerre dr z
