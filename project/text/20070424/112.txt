informed reader energy hydrogen may not be greenest route for cars technology review april hydrogen fuel is widely seen as a potentially environmentally clean alternative to fossil fuels for use in cars but technology writer david talbot says the perception is wrong powering automobiles with hydrogen could actually be more polluting than gasoline the problem is says mr talbot scientists are several decades away from being able to manufacture hydrogen in a way that doesnt increase greenhouse gas emissions in a review of a book about climate change mr talbot chief correspondent for the massachusetts institute of technologys technology review considers the case of a bmw ag prototype vehicle the hydrogen sedan the car emits water vapor for exhaust instead of the carbon dioxide produced by gasoline powered vehicles that is thought to contribute to global warming one way to produce hydrogen is to extract it directly from fossil fuels another potentially more environmentally friendly approach is to use electricity to split water molecules this process requires energy that could come from renewable sources water wind sunlight and biofuels like corn but renewable energy accounts for just of the worlds electricity not including from hydropower with such scarce renewable energy resources hydrogen power might wind up being produced with coal which generates more carbon dioxide than any other energy source that would defeat the environmental inspiration behind vehicles like the hydrogen mr talbot concludes in a review of "hell and high water " a book by joseph romm an mit trained physicist a more efficient route for car makers would be to focus on high mileage gasoline powered vehicles they are simpler and less sexy than hydrogen cars mr talbot says but for now they stack up as the cleaner option global affairs a little creativity could solve seemingly intractable problems foreign policy may june some of the worlds toughest problems from poverty to deadly diseases to financial fraud actually have creative solutions within reach say nearly two dozen experts on global affairs surveyed by foreign policy an overhaul of the way foreign aid is distributed more than increases in aid itself could greatly alleviate poverty says esther duflo a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology projects that receive funding should be evaluated for effectiveness using the same level of rigor applied to testing new drugs ms duflo says if the often arbitrary way in which projects are selected is reformed more aid would end up helping the poor help themselves she says malaria could be brought under control in africa by at a cost of about &# billion a year says jeffrey d sachs director of the earth institute at columbia university the disease will kill one million to three million children this year with of the deaths in africa the tab could be picked up by the one billion people who live in wealthier countries at a cost of about &# per person a year to tackle the growing problem of online banking fraud the system of domain names should be overhauled for financial institutions says mikko hyppoenen chief research officer at f secure corp in helsinki finland that would frustrate crooks who churn out phony web sites resembling those of real companies in order to steal personal information developing a bank suffix and charging banks &# to secure a domain name instead of the &# it now costs would make the names much harder to acquire to help diminish the toll of aids vaccines could be administered even if they are shown to be effective only of the time says seth berkley president and chief executive of the nonprofit international aids vaccine initiative putting the best vaccines on a fast track pipeline would greatly speed development dr berkley says
