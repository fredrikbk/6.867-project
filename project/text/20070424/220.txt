turkeys western destiny by midnight tomorrow prime minister recep tayip erdogan will decide the ruling justice and development partys akp candidate for president of turkey ten days ago in an unprecedented gathering demonstrating the polarization gripping that country hundreds of thousands marched in ankara against mr erdogan choosing himself they chanted such slogans as "no imam in cankaya" the presidential palace "and the army should do its job" getting rid of mr erdogan ironically they insist that he remain in the more important job of prime minister given the growing clamor as well as concern from many in his own party wanting their best vote getter to remain prime minister this cannot be precluded the rising popular tensions and talk of military coups reinforce the perception that the upcoming presidential election and parliamentary ones likely to quickly follow represent a historic turning point for the first time in turkeys modern history an islam influenced political party will control the two most important institutions of the state the presidency and parliament this would be true even if mr erdogan remains prime minister because the president is elected by the parliament which the akp dominates many fear a decline in turkeys secular state and a reorientation of its foreign policy away from the west and toward the islamic world control of the executive and legislative branches gives akp the ability to appoint university rectors bureaucratic administrators and to alter important pieces of legislation and social conventions with the power to appoint many judges the akp will in effect control all branches of turkeys democracy even the military turkeys most autonomous body fears that an akp president may interfere with promotions the principal concern for most secularists is not the introduction of shariah law but rather the greater infusion of religion into all aspects of turkish life many elements of the party have been pushing hard to enhance the position of religious schools and particularly relax the ban on headscarves especially in universities in short the nature of turkish life will change one cannot be oblivious to such concerns because they also are based on secularists firm belief that mr erdogan cannot be trusted and whatever his words and policies e g his dedication to european union membership they are a smokescreen for darker purposes still judging by mr erdogans record the past four years his agenda will be far from "islamist " the akp came to power democratically and by most indications has governed well the economy is booming industry flourishing eu oriented reforms are in full swing and turkey is a rising power in the region regardless of who becomes president the akp will still have to worry about the turkish military looming large over politics its own desire to enter the eu with all the socioeconomic concessions that entails and the enduring democratic imperative to produce results and retain the confidence of the population to win elections hopefully continued akp domination will finally lead to the growth of a serious opposition party missing in turkey for years while the new president has to assume an above party persona this will clearly not satisfy the strongest secularists for whom the akp mr erdogan and his headscarf wearing wife remain anathema still whether mr erdogan remains prime minister or becomes president there is little realistic threat to turkeys democracy surveys show turkeys people becoming more religious but also adamantly opposing an islamic state the correctives of a rapidly growing civil society a press increasingly fond of freedom and democratic accountability will remain if turkey achieves this transition peacefully it will signal the normalization and maturation of its politics especially because mr erdogans success will come against the militarys wishes in the last years the turkish military the protectors of ataturks secular legacy initiated four coups against elected leaders in a country where a chief of staffs press conference gets more interest than one by the president or prime minister it will take sustained political and economic stability a combination which has so far eluded turkey to remove the fear of military intervention from politics once and for all the akp and mr erdogan anxious not to rock the boat and confirm they are the reliable conservative party they claim to be may well prove their critics wrong and oversee just such a period particularly if the eu helps mr erdogans turkey has become a more confident and active international player and its foreign policy is no longer american centric a result of changing geostrategic realities the blossoming of its economy and a floundering u s policy in the region most importantly mr erdogan despite all the european obstacles has realigned turkey closer to the eu continues to pursue membership and offered dramatic concessions to resolve the cyprus conflict while the u s and turkey have many common policies they continue to have differences on matters such as iraq iran syria and hamas under mr erdogan turkey has established an independent voice in the middle east but both countries have tried to minimize or overlook their differences and recognize a common interest turkey today is not the turkey of years ago largely a u s supplicant threatened by moscow and suffering economically turkeys strength and new assertiveness can complement u s strategic interests and should be welcomed even if americans have to work harder to manage the bilateral relationship iraq however looms large as a problem even as turkeys leaders fervently hope the u s succeeds in keeping iraq together turks feel they have lost much from americas military involvement in iraq it has brought them face to face with a long dreaded nightmare a kurdish state next door and its political impact on turkeys own kurds coupled with shoddy eu treatment and rising anti americanism this has re aroused xenophobic nationalism present turkish concerns focus on two issues a proposed referendum on whether oil rich kirkuk is to be included in iraqi kurdistan which they vehemently oppose and the unwillingness of the u s or the iraqi kurds to eliminate the anti turkish pkk insurgents based in northern iraq both issues are straining relations with washington and can quickly develop into a full blown crisis recent threats by some iraqi kurdish leaders have prompted ominous counter threats from turkish generals if the situation is not managed prudently it may portend a dramatic shift in the balance of the u s turkey alliance and is perhaps the biggest danger to continued akp rule whether mr erdogan becomes president or remains prime minister turkey will not be "lost" as some in washington not the u s government fear the turkish peoples ties to the west democracy and secularism are hard to sever and capable of withstanding great challenges nor is there any indication that mr erdogan or his party will attempt a dramatic excision turkeys growth and dynamism lies with the west mr abramowitz a senior fellow at the century foundation is a former american ambassador to turkey mr barkey is professor of international relations at lehigh and concurrently public policy scholar at the wilson center
