earnings digest among all the products brought together in procter &amp gamble co s acquisition of gillette two carried particularly high expectations because of their natural fit the worlds no toothbrush and the worlds no toothpaste but putting together gillettes oral b and p&amp gs crest turned out to be more complicated than it looked a corporate structure featuring dual presidents proved so unwieldy that the senior president finally stepped aside a forced move for oral b employees from boston to crests cincinnati home led to an exit of talent then there were culture clashes oral b favored meetings while crest liked memos oral b made relatively quick decisions crest deliberated more the sales forces which had to wait several months to merge because p&amp g was required to make divestitures first gunned for each others jobs before the company made cutbacks including layoffs by combining crest and oral b p&amp g hopes to transform the fragmented oral care shelves of drugstores so they look more like the hair care or skin products shelves where consumers often buy a suite of products meant to work together after years of slow growth the oral care market is expected to pick up as baby boomers age to overtake colgate palmolive co the leader both in toothpaste and the overall oral care market p&amp g decided to combine oral b and crest products under a new line it had recently launched "pro health " in colgates total toothpaste had helped it grab u s market leader status from longtime top seller crest p&amp g sought to snatch it back with the help of the "pro health" label and a new more powerful crest formula it had been developing for years the company hoped that adding oral b toothbrushes to the line would give the campaign an extra push world wide colgate sales are almost triple those of crest but in the u s crest has been clawing back it narrowed colgates &# million lead in to &# million in or about of colgates u s sales according to euromonitor international inc the u s sales figures dont include wal mart stores inc which doesnt provide sales data in crest edged closer growing by to &# million in u s sales just &# million behind colgate the pro health lines effects arent clear yet the toothpaste was launched in august and the lines new oral b toothbrush a hybrid of battery powered and manual styles was introduced just last month gillettes oral care president bruce cleverly was given the top job of merging the oral care divisions of p&amp g and gillette his appointment announced in july was heralded as a sign that p&amp g was keen to learn from gillettes methods and its executive talent p&amp g chief executive a g lafley had declared from the start that p&amp g would adopt some of gillettes business strategies usually p&amp g simply subsumes its acquisitions but mr cleverly then years old wasnt given the free hand he was used to at gillette people who worked with him say at p&amp g executives had to go through a consensus seeking process to make major decisions mr cleverly also had to contend with p&amp gs oral care president charlie pierce then who in an unusual structure reported to him but also to the ceo good sense prevailed crest and oral b started by considering eliminating one of the two famous brands "there was an attempt to start with a blank piece of paper should we become all crest or all oral b " says mr cleverly traditionally p&amp g extended single brand names to related products so that consumers of pantene hair products for instance buy its shampoo conditioner and hairstyling products with the expectation that using them together brings added benefits but mr cleverly was determined not to let either brand disappear an analysis of the brands global strengths and consumer resonance persuaded executives to keep both &# billion brands intact mr cleverly says "fortunately good sense prevailed and if it hadnt i would have made sure it would have " instead p&amp g decided to add oral b to the pro health "sub brand" it had created for crest the line was aimed at consumers willing to pay more for products that touted health benefits as opposed to flavor or cosmetic appeal p&amp g already had introduced a crest pro health mouthwash and next was bringing out crest pro health toothpaste with stannous fluoride an ingredient crest had used little since when it switched to weaker sodium fluoride which has a longer shelf life p&amp g marketers first synchronized the launch of the new crest toothpaste with the introduction of a new low priced battery powered oral b toothbrush they pitched the products together to retailers to get more shelf space and displayed them together under broad slogans like "together for a healthier smile " in wal mart stores shoppers saw a customized poster of the related products captioned "why the wal mart greeter is really smiling " meanwhile p&amp g started developing a new toothbrush that eventually became the oral b pulsar pro health introduced last month it adds battery power vibration to a new bristle design messrs cleverly and pierce also had to figure out how to combine the work forces of both businesses including sales and marketing although some gillette divisions were staying in boston mr cleverly decided oral b needed to move to cincinnati crest had a big research facility outside the city in mason ohio complete with dentist chairs where crest scientists worked up new products and tested them "it became very clear to me early on that this whole idea wouldnt reach its full potential unless we combined the two businesses physically " he says oral bs research operation however stayed in kronberg germany alongside researchers for gillettes braun unit to market its home city to its new boston employees in november p&amp g hosted a three day weekend visit dubbed "get to know cincinnati" for oral b employees and their spouses the campaign included bus tours through downtown and surrounding suburbs p&amp g brought in school representatives and local realtors and hosted a dinner at the top floor restaurant of the millennium hotel to show off the cincinnati skyline to highlight the citys cultural offerings p&amp g handed out tickets to the cincinnati art museum and the national underground railroad freedom center employees were given until the summer of to decide meanwhile messrs cleverly and pierce united the sales teams that called on dentists a crucial task ahead of the planned august product launches dentists are hugely influential in the oral care market p&amp g tracks how many of them recommend their products as in crests slogan " out of dentists recommend " the company claims that in most product categories its products lead among dentist recommendations traditionally p&amp g and oral b sales teams had fiercely competed against each other to get their products into dentists offices p&amp g hawked its crest toothpaste as well as its spinbrush toothbrushes while gillettes oral b offered brushes along with its high end rembrandt toothpaste after the merger sales representatives would need to promote both oral b and crest products in more than dentist offices legal hurdle but before the two sides could fully work together the merged company needed to clear a legal hurdle u s and european regulators ordered selloffs to address antitrust concerns the two sides had to wait about five months until march after p&amp g sold spinbrush to church &amp dwight co and rembrandt toothpaste to johnson &amp johnson meanwhile the two sales teams competed more furiously than they had before because they were fighting for their jobs p&amp g told both crest and oral b sales teams that they intended to "field the best team " says a p&amp g spokeswoman to drive home the point that salespeople for both brands would have to prove themselves to the company not just the gillette newcomers "basically there was no love lost between us until we were told to stop taking the other ones business " says one former gillette employee later a number of sales representatives were laid off others accepted severance packages rigid structure gillette staffers also had to learn to cope with p&amp gs famously rigid culture which took some adjustment says michelle stacy who headed gillettes sales to dental professionals and has the same job for the merged operation p&amp g employees are known for loading their communications with acronyms like cib "consumer is boss" fmot "first moment of truth " or the moment when consumers notice a product in a store and smot the "second moment of truth " when they use it outside board members use glossaries at meetings and ms stacy says she needs one too "i have it in my briefcase at all times " she says pointing to her attaches front pocket another difference p&amp g people tend to put things on paper at gillette they have meetings ms stacy was accustomed to giving powerpoint presentations "i hadnt written a memo in to years " she says mr cleverly used to working under former gillette ceo james kilts also faced adjustments he balked at what he saw as laborious processes and slow decision making at p&amp g say former gillette employees familiar with the matter "the cultural differences were real " mr cleverly says moreover his influence turned out to be limited because mr pierce delivered his own updates on the business to the ceo mr pierce says the structure "worked great" because operating and integrating the two businesses called for two leaders "bruce and i were a strong team and effectively divided the work " he says mr cleverly saw it differently "we didnt need that much horsepower really and at some point we created more confusion than clarity " he says he also says he was hesitant to move his family as he neared retirement by early he decided a single executive would be more effective and told mr lafley he thought mr pierce should take over on his own he announced his decision to employees in april to take effect the following january he then took a new role seeking out acquisitions for the company pledging to stay through the end of this year he never relocated to cincinnati a significant contingent of boston employees also declined to move p&amp g says of oral b employees who were offered positions agreed to stay with the company after the merger including those who werent required to relocate across gillette of the employees who were offered positions accepted "we didnt get as many people to move to cincinnati as we would have wished " says mr cleverly instead he said they had to "backfill the organization from p&amp g folks " in august p&amp g was ready to proceed with its first crest and oral b combination for its store displays the marketing department adopted bold designs from gillettes launch of its fusion razor the year before "in the stores all you saw was orange " says diane dietz p&amp gs general manager of north america oral care pro health got bright blue displays with less text than p&amp g normally used aggressive competition colgate wasnt taking its beefed up competition lightly it aggressively promoted total against the pro health brand bundled two tubes in one box to tempt consumers to stock up and offered sale prices during an earnings conference call with analysts last october reuben mark colgates ceo adopted what he called some of president bushs rhetoric to react to p&amp gs pro health launch "bring em on " he said p&amp gs mr lafley fired back six days later on his companys earnings conference call comparing the current toothpaste battle to his experience launching liquid tide in the mid s against then leading rival liquid wisk made by unilever today tide dominates the liquid detergent market one merged p&amp g group had little problem integrating the scientists "basically when the deal was announced we realized that our sandbox suddenly had lots of cool new toys in it " says matthew doyle p&amp gs director of global oral care research and product development he calls the union of crest chemists and oral b engineers "a big science love fest " mr doyle and his team visited oral bs german technological center where scientists introduced them to their favorite beers and bundesliga soccer games p&amp g hosted the germans in cincinnati taking them to steak dinners and on bike rides now the two groups are trying to develop an oral b toothbrush and crest toothpaste designed to work best together
