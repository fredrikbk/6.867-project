politics &amp economics trucking firms bemoan stricter emissions rules industry says new engines cut mileage with pollution public health benefits cited washington a requirement that newly manufactured diesel trucks spew out less soot starting this year is posing a paradox for truck fleets these new generation trucks are cleaner than older generation vehicles but they get worse mileage with emission standards to get even tougher in truck fleet owners are seeking changes to other rules to help improve efficiency some are lobbying for the go ahead to hitch up longer trailers while others are pushing requirements for manufacturers to make engines offering a certain minimum mileage previous generation trucks average about nine or miles to each gallon of diesel fuel new engines designed to meet the more stringent federal mandate on truck exhaust get about one mile less to the gallon that may not seem like much but it all adds up for large fleet owners that operate trucks crisscrossing the country "for every additional mile per gallon lost it costs us about &# million in total annual fuel costs" said yrc worldwide chief executive bill zollars yrc is one of the largest transportation providers in the country operating a fleet of trucks a gallon of diesel costs about &# and the trucking industry consumes about billion gallons annually the environmental protection agency took aim at trucks with a phased in approach to reducing heavy truck emissions beginning in trucks account for about of all nitrous oxide emissions a principal component of smog and of all particulate matter also called soot generated by vehicles on the nations roads under the new standards diesel trucks manufactured after january must produce less nitrous oxide and less particulate matter than emitted by previous generation trucks older generation trucks with higher polluting engines can continue to operate until they are retired they still make up the majority of trucks plying the nations roads the new generation diesel engines are undeniably cleaner one truck with a designed diesel engine pollutes the equivalent of trucks with the engine but while the industry officials say they support cleaner emissions some question whether the new rules are really beneficial in the long run "we are burning more fuel to move the same freight it does cause the average person to ponder whether we are making progress or not " said bill graves chief executive of american trucking associations a washington lobbying group representing truckers and truck fleet owners he said the association is stepping up its lobbying to inform congress of the ramifications of the epa standards epa spokesman john millet said the agency had anticipated some fuel mileage loss with the new engines at the same time mr millet said "companies are telling us that these new clean engine systems have maintained or improved fuel efficiency through all sorts of innovations " such as new turbochargers that increase horsepower in smaller engines freightliner llc the largest heavy duty truck maker in north america confirmed that some loss of fuel economy was inevitable for engines to comply with the new standards certain parts of the engine must run at a higher temperature to burn off pollutants and that requires more fuel environmental groups said the public health benefits resulting from cleaner engines far outweigh any fuel economy loss to mitigate higher fuel costs some trucking fleets are calling for changes to other regulations some are pushing for a so called cafe or corporate average fuel economy standard for trucks such standards which have been in place for years in the automobile sector would require truck makers to produce vehicles that get a certain minimum mileage on average in essence forcing them to turn out higher efficiency engines manufacturers have said it would be either too difficult or too expensive to design an engine that has both higher fuel efficiency and fewer pollutants rep john dingell d mich chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce declined to comment on whether the panel would pursue a cafe standard for trucks some transportation companies are also lobbying congress to set a national speed limit for trucks to help save on fuel costs with vehicles burning more fuel the faster they drive most big rig fleet companies have outfitted their trucks with speed governors which prevent a vehicle from going above a certain speed limit usually or miles per hour independent truckers who own their own tractors generally dont use speed governors and can drive faster and get goods to a destination faster trucking companies argue that leads to an uneven playing field the american trucking associations said some of its members are also pushing for changes to the coming regulations that would allow longer trailers to be attached to each truck yrcs mr zollars said using longer trailers would let trucks carry larger loads at one time increasing overall fuel efficiency by about some truck fleet owners have found another way to mitigate the financial hit that has come with the new engines last year before the new emission standards kicked in some purchased more trucks than they needed apparently to roll out in lieu of new generation trucks when their existing trucks wear out partly as a result heavy duty truck sales rose in over the previous year
