a steel tycoon tries oil mittal makes small scale energy deals around the globe billionaire lakshmi mittal who has single handedly refashioned the global steel business is setting his sights on another elemental commodity oil in the past year the london moguls private investment company mittal investments has joined with indias state owned oil &amp natural gas corp for several overseas joint ventures in oil field exploration it also has teamed with large oil firms in russia and france to develop reserves in africa and asia taken individually the deals are relatively small yet in some respects they parallel the methodical way in which mr mittal over the past two decades built a tiny indonesian metals mill into mittal steel co which will finalize its merger with arcelor sa of luxembourg this summer the combined company will produce of the worlds steel making it three times the size of its closest rival because mr mittal is a force to be reckoned with in the global commodities business his moves are sending ripples through the oil industry "i dont think that he is going to be able to consolidate the whole worlds oil industry thats a big bite even for him " said billionaire wilbur ross who sits on the board of mittal steel of the netherlands "i think he is doing it partly to help india and partly to make money " mr mittal hails from india and although he left the country as a young man he still has several investment interests there including the partnership with oil &amp natural gas corp or ongc mr mittal is quiet about his intentions "the family is making investments to diversify the portfolio " he said in a recent interview declining to elaborate "it is a very infant stage there is nothing much to talk about " any foray into oil comes with risks while the steel business is cyclical prices swing with the global economy there is no business with bigger boom and bust cycles than oil todays lofty oil prices have inflated the cost of everything from older oil fields to new exploration licenses world wide boosting the entry costs for newcomers if oil prices fall hard it will be much harder to make money from mittals investments meantime salaries and other costs have soared pinching the biggest most efficient companies such as exxon mobil corp royal dutch shell plc and bp plc mr mittal has been inking some notable deals last year in nigeria ongc and mittal successfully bid for sought after oil exploration acreage part of their pitch a commitment to invest some &# billion to build a refinery a power plant and a railroad in the country mittal investments holds a stake in two joint ventures ongc mittal energy ltd and ongc mittal energy services ltd while ongc owns a stake in those ventures with the balance held by investment firm sbi capital markets ltd ongc has had several prospective deals fall through sometimes being outbid by others for new oil fields ongcs oil and gas portfolio outside india is thinly spread around the world including modest projects in places like myanmar sudan and the russian far east that is where mr mittal comes in the joint venture gives ongc a partner who is a specialist in deal making and who also has access to capital thanks to his reputation on wall street it "improves ongcs ability to go into these overseas areas more effectively " said luke parker of oil consulting firm wood mackenzie the partnership between mittal and ongc has plans to move further into energy trading and shipping and it could stretch to countries in coming years according to the parties the arrangement brings potential long term profits to mr mittal a quiet entry into the oil industry as well as increased favor with indias political elite mr mittal also has teamed with russias oao lukoil holdings and total sa of france paving the way for more deals in africa and central asia where those two countries are particularly active mittal investments also is getting into oil refining recently announcing a &# million investment for a stake in a refinery project to be built by state run refiner hindustan petroleum corp in india there are parallels between the steel industry of the s and oil today like steel was then oil is poised for consolidation and is dominated in many countries by state owned firms yet the differences are formidable when mr mittal started building his steel business many steelmakers were considered dinosaurs and could be bought cheaply by contrast the oil business is brimming with valued assets and pumping at near full throttle to meet demand he is competing with dozens of major global companies such as exxon mobil bp and chevron corp all scrambling to sign deals to develop big new prospects in places like africa and central asia meanwhile hundreds of smaller players compete against each other for smaller fields around the world mr mittals moves to cultivate a variety of partnerships could indicate he is contemplating a larger push snehal amin an executive with childrens investment fund management a london hedge fund that owns shares in mittal steel said he thinks mr mittal "sees an opportunity" but perhaps isnt certain whether he wants to be a casual investor or big player "its tough to know " he said adding "his track record speaks for itself "
