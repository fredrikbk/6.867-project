subscription tv providers think out of the set top box decoder devices long basic are upgraded with services to fight web competition the television set top box is getting a makeover courtesy of small companies such as san jose calif start up wire inc until recently so called set tops the boxes that cable satellite and phone companies provide to their television subscribers mainly served the basic function of decoding broadcast signals but thats changing as these companies fight to keep their grip on living rooms amid the rise of internet video and innovations such as apple inc s appletv a new device that allows consumers to take movies and other media from their personal computers to their television screens late last year at&amp t inc began deploying new set top boxes made by wire to tens of thousands of households that subscribe to at&amp ts homezone television service the silver and black device offers consumers options such as downloading videos from the internet or viewing digital photos on their tv screens the set top box "isnt just about channel changing anymore " says wires chief executive pasquale romano "a lot more services need to be coordinated through the box " big set top box manufacturers such as motorola inc and cisco systems inc s scientific atlanta unit previously relied on a one size fits all approach to making the devices many satellite and cable companies were also reluctant to put sophisticated software onto set tops because of the costs but in the face of rising competition subscription television providers are turning to little known hardware and software companies such as wire to help make their set top boxes more attractive to consumers now consumers can play interactive games through some set top boxes while others offer ways to craft personalized channels that include statistics on favorite sports teams networking firm ictv inc los gatos calif is working with reuters group plc and accuweather inc to offer interactive channels that can be accessed through the set top comcast corp and at&amp t are testing software from start up choicestream inc cambridge mass that enables the box to track a viewers activity and use that information to recommend channels and shows at&amp t last month invested &# million in choicestream and in january time warner inc s time warner cable rolled out new software from start up biap systems inc plano texas that allows consumers to bid on ebay auctions and track "fantasy football" statistics using their cable remote while watching regular programming on tv as a result of these new collaborations cable and satellite subscribers are getting a bigger variety of set top boxes with more interactive services new boxes are expected to boost the set top industrys overall growth according to research firm in stat cable phone and satellite television providers charge consumers for the additional services that come with some of these new boxes in the case of at&amp t consumers who choose to order the homezone service with the wire box are charged &# a month more than the companys standard satellite television service comcast charges consumers an additional &# a month for high definition programming which can be viewed only using a special high definition set top box not all of the innovations are aimed directly at consumers earlier this month the mountain view calif internet search giant google inc announced a deal with satellite company echostar communications inc to use set tops to create an automated system for buying selling and measuring the impact of tv ads running on echostars dish network that will potentially allow google to place more targeted ads and will provide advertisers with data about whether users changed the channel during a commercial google signed a similar deal with u k cable operator bskyb controlled by news corp late last year in the late s tivo inc and replaytv inc pushed innovation with stand alone digital video recorders that werent linked to any particular tv provider which allowed consumers to in effect pause live television and skip commercials makers of set top boxes for subscription television companies began to add similar digital functions to their devices and in the process marginalized tivo and replaytv replaytv filed for bankruptcy protection in and got out of the set top business in late tivo which remains unprofitable years after launch has sought to negotiate partnerships with providers such as comcast and cox communications inc "in this business if you want to play you need to have some sort of relationship with one of the big operators " says mike paxton an analyst with in stat "its tough being a stand alone player " the closely held wire which was founded in wont say whether its profitable however mr romano says that the at&amp t venture is a success and that the company plans to provide new boxes to other cable satellite and phone companies "the operators are hungry to differentiate themselves so were looking for opportunities there " he says wire which was virtually unknown in the set top industry before the deal with at&amp t is primarily a maker of "gateways " used to create home networking hubs through connections to pcs and the internet the company got interested in the set top world in when mr romano a harvard and massachusetts institute of technology graduate who was then wires chief technology officer noticed that at&amp t had begun offering dish networks satellite service as a package with its internet and phone service mr romano realized wire had an opportunity because it had technology to incorporate the internet home networking and tv content into one box rather than the separate boxes that at&amp t was having to provide customers with the package in early wire approached the communications giant to see if it was interested in a new box at&amp t which had previously invested in wire and counts the person firm as an equipment provider agreed "we talked with all of the major set top providers and looked at their capabilities and we felt wire had great strengths " says ken tysell an executive director at at&amp t since the launch of the new box late last year mr tysell says it has played an important role in attracting new customers to at&amp t but declined to provide specifics dan andrews an insurance attorney in san antonio recently subscribed to at&amp ts u verse service which comes with upgraded boxes made by motorola and scientific atlanta that allow setting the recorder remotely with a cellphone or pc mr andrews now often uses his office pc to program his set top such as for a recent college football game "i wouldve forgotten about it if id had to wait until i got home to do that " he says verizon communications inc which like at&amp t entered the tv business relatively recently says its set tops made by motorola can be set to record via pcs and it will later this year extend the capability to cellphones the company announced in january that by the end of the year software upgrades will allow customers to access internet radio and user generated content from the web though their set tops
