a tale of two scandals imagine that a top civil servant at a major multinational institution arranges a job for a fortysomething female colleague that comes with a &# raise and brings her yearly salary to about &# tax free now imagine that the couple have been photographed at a nudist beach him wearing nothing but a baseball cap the latest sordid twist in laffaire wolfowitz not at all this is the story of gunter verheugen first vice president of the european commission in brussels in its contrasts and similarities with the "scandal" now absorbing the world bank and its president it offers timely instruction on the nature and power of modern bureaucracies in april mr verheugen a former german parliamentarian for the social democrats appointed economist petra erler as his chief of staff in august the couple were spotted au naturel on a baltic shore mr verheugen who also has a wife has dismissed allegations of impropriety as "pure slander" and asked the german newsweekly der spiegel whether "two adults cant do as they wish in their private lives " in fact they cant the eu commissions code of conduct which he helped draft observes that "in their official and private lives commissioners should behave in a manner that is in keeping with the dignity of their office ruling out all risks of a conflict of interest helps guarantee their independence " dont think however that the commissioner is out on his ear german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier defends him as "an irreplaceable brussels heavyweight " while commission president jose manuel barroso says mr verheugen has his "full confidence " thats more support than mr wolfowitz will ever get from his european friends who are clucking noisily about the need for the world bank to preserve its "credibility" and for its president to be "beyond reproach " its also more than hes getting from the bush administration which is offering token words of support while quietly shopping former afghan finance minister ashraf ghani as a potential successor but this isnt just a story of european hypocrisy an old story like mr wolfowitz mr verheugen is a man of major prior accomplishments in his case engineering the enlargement of the european union to from member states also like mr wolfowitz mr verheugen came to his current job pledging to make war on the methods of his own bureaucracy "the idea is that the role of the commission is to keep the machinery running and the machinery is producing laws " he said last october "and thats exactly what i want to change " the machinery had a different idea mr verheugen announced plans in to do away with scores of economically burdensome and antiquated regulations which he thought could help lift economic growth when his efforts went nowhere he gave an interview to the press blaming the failure on the opposition hed encountered within the brussels bureaucracy the commissions staff union reacted predictably by calling on him to apologize and suggesting he resign not coincidentally it was around the same time that stories of his special relationship with ms erler and of her new job came to the attention of the press and the public now consider the wolfowitz saga superficially the similarities with mr verheugen rest with the details of their respective scandals a close lady friend on staff a suspiciously generous pay raise allegations of nepotism and conflicts of interest but aside from the facts that mr wolfowitz is unmarried and prefers his clothes on the substance of the cases could not be more different mr verheugen seems to have obscured the nature of his relationship with ms erler mr wolfowitz acknowledged his relationship with shaha riza before he took the job as bank president mr verheugen sought to use the power of his office to bring ms erler nearer to him mr wolfowitz sought to use the power of his to move ms riza away ms erler moved into a better job ms riza was forced into a lesser one mr verheugen ignored his own code of conduct mr wolfowitz followed the instructions of his ethics committee whose chairman later praised him for acting in a "constructive spirit " what the wolfowitz scandal comes down to then is that he gave ms riza a fat raise after the banks board agreed that she deserved compensation for losing her job this is where the bureaucracy comes in and the real similarities with the verheugen case begin when mr wolfowitz arrived at the world bank in it was to an institution ideologically committed to seeing him fail when he announced that he would make the fight against corruption his signature issue the ideological opposition became institutional as well as development economist william easterly observes for the world bank "priority no is to get the money out the door when you introduce a wild card like cutting off corrupt governments you threaten the loan pushing culture " since then its been a steady dribble of leaks about mr wolfowitzs every misstep and perceived wrongdoing most of them to the suggestible financial times the operative theory here says former bush administration diplomat otto reich is that if you throw enough mud at a man "the stain will remain even if none of the mud sticks " thats just what has happened in the campaign at the world bank having doused mr wolfowitz in skunk juices the critics can now say with justice that he stinks this isnt to say that mr wolfowitzs tenure at the world bank has been without disappointments mr easterly faults him for indulging utopian ambitions for what the bank can do to alleviate poverty and promote democracy but that cant possibly justify the furies that have now descended on mr wolfowitz like mr verheugen he sought to use his office to change an organization he thought mistakenly as it turns out that he ran unlike mr verheugen he never really did anything improper that he is now on the firing line while mr verheugen is not is a point worth noting that both men despite the great differences between them have been thwarted by their bureaucracies should be a reminder to everyone that the government of mandarins is more than just a danger to interloping neocons
