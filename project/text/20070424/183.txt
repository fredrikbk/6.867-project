sec finds no naked short ipo issue washington securities and exchange commission staff economists say they cannot find evidence that failure to deliver shares in initial public offerings is caused by manipulative trading the study examined ipos over months starting in january the economists found that stock delivery failures which some critics see as evidence of market manipulation occur regularly in ipos and they didnt find evidence that traders engaging in "naked" short selling are to blame short sellers borrow shares to sell in hopes of profiting by replacing the borrowed shares at a lower price naked short sales occur when sellers dont borrow shares they sell and may never borrow them a practice critics compare to counterfeiting the sec has said that failures to deliver stocks within a timely manner after a trade settles can be indicative of abusive or manipulative naked short selling the practice can deprive shareholders of the rights that come with stock ownership including the ability to vote shares and to lend them in an effort to crack down on abusive short sales the sec adopted new rules in and is considering making additional changes amid complaints of continued failures to deliver some shares within three days of the trade settlement as required stock delivery failures often are viewed as a way of measuring the degree of naked short sales but the sec economists said the delivery failures seen in the ipo market "cannot be explained by short selling in general or naked short selling specifically " instead the economists suggested that delivery failures might be related to underwriters seeking to support the ipo offering price in the immediate aftermarket which could result in failures to deliver shares in the short term short sales and delivery failures are a common feature in the ipo market almost all of the ipos in the study had short sales on their first trading day accounting for of trading volume and more than of shares offered about of ipos had delivery failures of at least shares on the first standard settlement day the economists found after five settlement days they said delivery failures were common enough that one third of the ipos wound up on the "threshold" list of hard to borrow shares and within the first trading days more than half of the ipos were on the threshold list yet delivery failures exceeded short sales for a large portion of the ipos which the economists said "casts doubt on the notion that the level of fails to deliver are caused by naked short selling " in addition the study showed high delivery failures following ipos were more common on the new york stock exchange and the american stock exchange than on the nasdaq stock market the authors suggested that may reflect the fact that it is harder for underwriters to provide price support for shares through open market purchases in markets such as the nyse which have trading specialists as opposed to nasdaq where the lead underwriter is always a market maker in the shares being offered
