enterprise going online isnt a must move for all entrepreneurs firms flourishing without a site say work isnt worth it pat brenchley the year old owner of heart to heart fabrics &amp more in winter haven fla advertises her seven year old business in many places the senior section of the local paper the vinyl cover of the city phone book even the tabletop at a nearby restaurant but not on the internet between selling sewing machines and running a slew of quilting classes mrs brenchley doesnt see the need have the time or want to spend the money on a web site "it seems like an overwhelming amount of work to do when im already worked to the max right now " she says upon request mrs brenchley will email class schedules to her customers but thats the extent of her online endeavors many small businesses are bucking conventional wisdom and holding off on jumping online the internet largely seen as a "must" for entrepreneurs can be a competitive fast changing and costly environment that some view as more of a hassle than a help while no one disputes that online marketing has leveled the playing field for small players looking to compete against larger deep pocketed rivals plenty of small businesses without web sites also are flourishing suggesting that being online isnt always a prerequisite for success indeed the rate of small firms rushing onto the web is slowing suggesting some entrepreneurial caution in this medium in a survey of businesses in varying industries released today the national small business association reports that of them dont have a web site whats more the growth rate of businesses opting to be online has slowed from to the percentage of small businesses with a web site jumped to from yet rose to only this year nearly two thirds of the small businesses surveyed dont use e commerce the results surprised rob yunich director of communications for the nsba "i would think in todays day and age you would have to have a web site " he says across the u s there are examples of the contrary like gregory giesche the year old owner of giesche shoe store in geneva ill mr giesche says he recognizes that shoe sales on the internet are strong but adds that he hasnt heard of any profit margins that make tackling the challenge worth the bother he doesnt computerize his inventory either opting instead for paper and pencil bookkeeping his tried and true system if not the most up to date has worked for more than a century his family has been in the retail shoe business since and now has two stores in the chicago suburbs one in geneva and one in glen ellyn run by his two brothers none of them has an interest in being online "everybody in my family is computer illiterate " he says "we have a difficult time understanding the internet " they advertise in local papers but mr giesche says their loyal customer following stems from the familys interactions with local churches and schools "we give generously to the community " he says that strategy is common among small businesses says mr yunich advertising in shoppers coupons or other forms of print media continues to reach customers effectively "just plain old word of mouth " he says "that works wonders too " retail businesses especially those with constantly changing inventory and a variety of products are among the most likely to shy away from an online presence often its the price of designing maintaining and advertising an e commerce web site from a few hundred dollars to several thousand that keeps small business owners off the internet john jantsch a small business marketing coach suggests that cost conscious small business owners might want to look to a local college or university for a tech oriented student who can design a web site entrepreneurs can have a simple site and a years worth of hosting for less than &# mr jantsch says lois riske president of general cleaning inc has explored the possibility of an online presence her commercial contract cleaning firm in homestead pa is nearly years old has around employees and gets most of its business through its sales team and by word of mouth ms riske asked designers to come up with examples of what a web site for her company might look like the mock ups she saw however were disappointing in part because of what she was comparing them to ms riske knows many of her customers and competitors have elaborate web sites funded by franchises or parent corporations "you dont want to put something out there thats not top drawer " she says certainly there are plenty of services that let small businesses throw up a bare bones web site for less than &# a month but helping consumers find a site in todays crowded online marketplace is another ballgame and businesses typically must spend more to make sure they pop up regularly in search engines since that requires weeding through a myriad of solutions some time pressed small business owners feel making the move is more trouble and cost than its worth ms riske figured it would cost at least &# a month to have the kind of site she wanted that cost compared with other expenses seemed too high for the amount of business it would bring in "its hard to justify that much of an expense " she says then theres the price of advertising the site says martin lehman a marketing director for the new york chapter of score a national nonprofit that encourages and educates small business owners "youve still got to let the world know that you have a web site " says mr lehman who adds that entrepreneurs should take a close look at their target customer before investing in a site some entrepreneurs continue to get along fine offline for now but acknowledge its time for a change pat bardo went three years without having a web site for her arts and apparel boutique outside the box in lexington ky ms bardo a year old retired rehabilitation counselor is an avid computer user and says her customers are too she tried unsuccessfully several times to find the right web site designer they made big promises she said but werent able to deliver earlier this month however ms bardo met scott clark from websiteadvice com he didnt intimidate her with confusing language or make grandiose promises instead ms bardo says mr clark offered up a comprehensive plan to design and market the web site within her budget "i felt like golly thats what i really need " says ms bardo "someone who can really do this thing "
