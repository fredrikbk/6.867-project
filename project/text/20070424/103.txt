hillarycare installment plan any doubt that "universal" health care has returned as a dominant political issue vanished with last months forum for democratic presidential candidates in nevada "we need a movement " hillary clinton declared "we need people to make this the no voting issue in the election " she and her friends in congress are already working on it notably by proposing to greatly expand the state childrens health insurance program "schip" was enacted in as bill clintons health care consolation prize after the implosion of hillarycare it expires in september without reauthorization and democrats are using the opening to turn it into another giant middle class health care entitlement call it hillarycare on the installment plan schip was conceived or at least sold as a way to insure children from low income families that arent poor enough to qualify for medicaid included as part of the balanced budget act of schip began as a federal block grant of about &# billion over years states receive an annual fixed federal contribution then they match the funds and design their own programs by expanding medicaid creating a separate schip program or some combination states determine eligibility and benefits some have premiums or co pays usually at negligible rates the bush administration wants to add &# billion to the schip budget bringing it to &# billion over the next five years democrats want to see that and raise by &# billion to &# billion they pronounce schip "underfunded" and sure enough funding already falls short of covering enrollees in states by about &# million but this "crisis" arose because some states have grossly exceeded schips mandate they are using the program to expand government subsidized coverage well beyond poor kids to children from wealthier families and even to adults and theyre doing so even as some million poor children continue to go uninsured the schip legislation defines potential recipients as children in families making twice the federal poverty line or &# a year for a family of four but states are encouraged to apply for waivers to allow for more flexibility now states have eligibility thresholds above of poverty and nine of those are at or over in new jersey the figure is new york recently passed a budget raising eligibility to the highest in the nation at or &# for a family of four thats an income close to what democrats usually define as "rich" when theyre trying to raise taxes some states are using schip to create universal child health programs regardless of need governor rod blagojevich recently expanded the illinois schip program to insure all children with premiums and co pays based on parental income pennsylvanias "cover all kids" and tennessees "cover kids" programs do the same as of february the government accountability office found that states were using schip to cover adults pregnant women parents of medicaid or schip kids and even childless adults arizona michigan minnesota and wisconsin cover more adults than children in minnesota spent of its grant insuring adults and arizona spent two thirds the same way and no wonder the schip funding structure provides incentives for running over budget in three year periods all unspent schip allocations across the states are tallied up and redistributed a state that exceeds its allotment gets more money from a state that didnt in the states that went over budget in of schip recipients were adults were all for federalism and if states want to raise taxes to pay for government run health care they have every right the problem is when they exploit federal policy loopholes to do so and thus stick taxpayers in more responsible states with a larger tab in states received an extra grant either through redistribution or the feds picking up the check for overruns thus the federal government pays about of total schip outlays despite the premise of "matching" state grants a bill introduced by senator clinton and representative john dingell would make all of this worse it would index government schip outlays to national health spending and growth in states child population without "quantifiable" progress i e expanded rolls funding drops the legislation would also create incentives for states to expand schip to the new york level of of poverty if this keeps up a family will soon be eligible for schip and subject to the alternative minimum tax in other words what began as a hard cap grant to cover the working poor is evolving into an open ended entitlement to cover whatever promises states make and all under the political cover of helping "children " instead of debating government run health care on its merits democrats are building it step by step on the sly or as mrs clinton put it in nevada "make no mistake this will be a series of steps " theres a lesson here for republicans who agreed to create schip in a trade for mr clintons signature on their "balanced budget " balanced budgets vanish in the blink of an election while entitlements like schip live on and expand as an ever larger claim on taxpayers mark this down as another case in which bill clinton outfoxed newt gingrich the least republicans can do now is work to return schip to its original more modest purposes see related letter "letters to the editor big village knows best" wsj april
