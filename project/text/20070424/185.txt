shattering the bell curve the black swan by nassim nicholas taleb random house pages &# life isnt fair many of the most coveted spoils wealth fame links on the web are concentrated among the few if such a distribution doesnt sound like the familiar bell shaped curve youre right along the hilly slopes of the bell curve most values the data points that track whatever is being measured are clustered around the middle the average value is also the most common value the points along the far extremes of the curve contribute very little statistically if random people gather in a room and the worlds tallest man walks in the average height doesnt change much but if bill gates walks in the average net worth rises dramatically height follows the bell curve in its distribution wealth does not it follows an asymmetric l shaped pattern known as a "power law " where most values are below average and a few far above in the realm of the power law rare and extreme events dominate the action for nassim taleb irrepressible quant jock and the author of "fooled by randomness" the contrast between the two distributions is not an amusing statistical exercise but something more profound it highlights the fundamental difference between life as we imagine it and life as it really is in "the black swan" a kind of cri de coeur mr taleb struggles to free us from our misguided allegiance to the bell curve mindset and awaken us to the dominance of the power law the attractiveness of the bell curve resides in its democratic distribution and its mathematical accessibility collect enough data and the pattern reveals itself allowing both robust predictions of future data points such as the height of the next five people to enter the room and accurate estimations of the size and frequency of extreme values anticipating the occasional giant or dwarf the power law distribution by contrast would seem to have little to recommend it not only does it disproportionately reward the few but it also turns out to be notoriously difficult to derive with precision the most important events may occur so rarely that existing data points can never truly assure us that the future wont look very different from the present we can be fairly certain that we will never meet anyone feet tall but it is entirely possible that over time we will hear of a man twice as rich as bill gates or witness a market crash twice as devastating as that of october the problem insists mr taleb is that most of the time we are in the land of the power law and dont know it our strategies for managing risk for instance including modern portfolio theory and the black scholes formula for pricing options are likely to fail at the worst possible time mr taleb argues because they are generally and mistakenly based on bell curve assumptions he gleefully cites the example of long term capital management ltcm an early hedge fund that blew up after its nobel laureate founders "allowed themselves to take a monstrous amount of risk" because "their models ruled out the possibility of large deviations " mr taleb is fascinated by the rare but pivotal events that characterize life in the power law world he calls them black swans after the philosopher karl poppers observation that only a single black swan is required to falsify the theory that "all swans are white" even when there are thousands of white swans in evidence provocatively mr taleb defines black swans as events such as the rise of the internet or the fall of ltcm that are not only rare and consequential but also predictable only in retrospect we never see them coming but we have no trouble concocting post hoc explanations for why they should have been obvious surely mr taleb taunts we wont get fooled again but of course we will writing in a style that owes as much to stephen colbert as it does to michel de montaigne mr taleb divides the world into those who "get it" and everyone else a world partitioned into heroes popper hayek yogi berra those on notice harold bloom necktie wearers personal finance advisers and entities that are dead to him the bell curve newspapers the nobel prize in economics a humanist at heart mr taleb ponders not only the effect of black swans but also the reason we have so much trouble acknowledging their existence and this is where he hits his stride we eagerly romp with him through the follies of confirmation bias our tendency to reaffirm our beliefs rather than contradict them narrative fallacy our weakness for compelling stories silent evidence our failure to account for what we dont see ludic fallacy our willingness to oversimplify and take games or models too seriously and epistemic arrogance our habit of overestimating our knowledge and underestimating our ignorance for anyone who has been compelled to give a long term vision or read a marketing forecast for the next decade mr talebs chapter excoriating "the scandal of prediction" will ring painfully true "what is surprising is not the magnitude of our forecast errors " observes mr taleb "but our absence of awareness of it " we tend to fail miserably at predicting the future but such failure is little noted nor long remembered it seems to be of remarkably little professional consequence i suspect that part of the explanation for this inconsistency may be found in a study of stock analysts that mr taleb cites their predictions while badly inaccurate were not random but rather highly correlated with each other the lesson evidently is that its better to be wrong than alone if we accept mr talebs premise about power law ascendancy we are left with a troubling question how do you function in a world where accurate prediction is rarely possible where history isnt a reliable guide to the future and where the most important events cannot be anticipated mr taleb presents a range of answers be prepared for various outcomes he says and dont rush for buses but its clear that he remains slightly vexed by the world he describes so vividly then again beatific serenity may not be the goal here as mr taleb warns certitude is likely to be found only in a fools bell curve paradise where we choose the comfort of the "precisely wrong" over the challenge of the "broadly correct " beneath mr talebs blustery rhetoric lives a surprisingly humble soul who has chosen to follow a demanding and somewhat lonely path i wonder how many of us will have the courage to join him very few i predict unless of course something unexpected happens dr shaywitz is a physician scientist in new jersey
