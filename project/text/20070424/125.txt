microsoft embeds sleeper in business software when the miami dade county public schools set out to build a way for its teachers students and parents to collaborate online it was surprised to discover it already had microsoft corp software that could help do the job included with software the school district had previously bought was something called sharepoint services which miami dade used as the first step in creating a system for planning school programs and classes posting notices and handling other tasks that require its teachers and students to collaborate "we kind of unintentionally fell into it " says deborah karcher executive officer at miami dades information technology group the school system considered an alternative from international business machines corp but with the microsoft software already in place "it just seemed like a very low risk " what miami dade wanted to do is part of a broad trend in how corporations and institutions are beginning to use their computers historically using most pc programs has been a solitary thing workers used ad hoc methods to work together say by emailing a spreadsheet among different team members one by one now a host of new "collaboration" software is letting them use corporate networks to more easily work on the same documents at the same time and accomplish any number of tasks that groups or teams do together workers using collaboration software for instance could have a particular document like a spreadsheet on their respective screens simultaneously with all having access to the material while talking to one another over a videoconference to do that companies need to install a mix of software running behind the scenes that ties together pcs databases email systems and other programs businesses use many businesses to their surprise are finding that microsoft anticipated that demand and has already sold them sharepoint before they even knew they needed it sharepoint is now microsofts contender in an emerging battle over collaboration software with companies from a cross section of the technology industry including oracle corp adobe systems inc ibm emc corp cisco systems inc companygoogle company inc and lesser known players such as zimbra inc alfresco software inc the plone foundation and socialtext inc each company has its own approach to collaborative software market but "all want to be central to it " says peter okelly an analyst at researcher burton group for microsoft sharepoint is a critical engine to increase sales of a broad array of its other software in the company made a basic form of sharepoint available as a free download with windows server a version of windows for the large corporate computers of customers like miami dade schools the hope was that the customers would seek and pay for a newer version of the program with more collaboration features and would then go on to buy other microsoft software to date largely unheralded microsoft has sold million licenses to the enhanced version of sharepoint across companies no marketing campaigns are in the works "when we get sharepoint in there it sells itself " says jeff teper vice president of microsofts sharepoint server group the free version of sharepoint is a separate download because including extra software with versions of windows is a touchy subject with regulators bundling got microsoft into trouble when it used windows to boost its web browser and crush rival browser maker netscape which prompted the companys landmark antitrust battle with the u s government in the case of sharepoint windows server customers have to make the decision to buy sharepoint server which is the full blown collaboration software the government has routinely monitored microsofts compliance with the antitrust settlement while microsoft has internal controls to keep its products within bounds of the settlement hawaiian airlines wants to add collaboration features to its web site to allow say frequent flier customers to share travel tips and stories says david osborne chief information officer at the airline already standardized on microsoft products the airline decided to license the enhanced sharepoint software which it has been using since last month "it wasnt particularly difficult " mr osborne says "the thing was already part of your infrastructure " salespeople at american bible society use sharepoint from the field when they sell bibles take donations or sell financial instruments if a salesperson sells a retirement package he or she can use sharepoint to securely enter customer information that then can be accessed by american bible society workers who process the order outside partners such as financial institutions can also securely access the data says nick garbidakis chief information officer at american bible society in the past salespeople might use a fax and or email to submit the information methods that were insecure and slow says mr garbidakis "it would take days or weeks to exchange the data " he says the society upgraded to the enhanced version of sharepoint and is now rolling it out more broadly in the organization he said microsofts rivals too are profiting from collaboration software of their own ibms notes software is the pioneer product in the collaboration market and despite years of losing market share is now resurgent as ibm rolls out related products including new software for sharing content called quickr that help it compete better with sharepoint says mr okelly the burton group analyst oracle meanwhile has built collaboration products around its core database products most recently rolling out webcenter suite a sharepoint competitor the collaboration battle could have long term strategic benefits for the companies once a given software makers collaboration programs are in place a company using them will start filling them with valuable company data from documents to videos after all that company data is in the system its hard to move to a competing system say some industry executives who compare the emerging collaboration battle to an earlier era when oracle became the market leader in databases after a mass of companies committed their information to oracle databases once companies were on an oracle database it became easier for the software maker to sell upgrades and other software and harder for competitors to woo away the customer "owning the data is owning the customer in perpetuity " says matt asay vice president at alfresco which makes software for managing content "our vision much like office was to build an integrated set of compatibility that is relative low cost and easy to use " says microsofts mr teper the catch to squeeze all of the functionality out of sharepoint microsoft customers need to buy extra software from the company if they dont already have it for instance features in the latest version of sharepoint will work only with microsofts office the newest version of the business software suite that could be a beneficial connection for office as microsoft struggles to convince some business to upgrade to office when their current office setup works fine sharepoint is also starting to lift weaker microsoft products alan kahn chief executive of interdyn aka a company that resells microsoft products says that sharepoint is helping to spur sales of microsoft dynamics software which has been a perennial laggard that strategy extends to the range of already strong microsoft products that work with sharepoint from its sql server database to corporate search technologies within two months of rolling out the basic version of sharepoint last summer miami dade was surprised to find over students accessed the system prompting the school system to upgrade to the enhanced version of sharepoint those licenses combined with security software and other microsoft software and services cost it an additional &# million says ms karcher the executive officer uses of sharepoint contemplated by miami dade teachers include sharing research materials posting and discussing assignments and creating a homework "drop off" box for students to submit their assignments yesterday miami dade opened the system to school administrators by the end of this summer ms karcher says sharepoint will be available to one million students and their families teachers and employees in the school district
