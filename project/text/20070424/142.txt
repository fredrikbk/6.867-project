negotiators approve iraq war funding bill required troop drawdown starting by oct presages veto fight with president washington house senate negotiators approved a &# billion iraq war funding bill that sets up an almost certain veto fight with president bush by requiring him to begin a withdrawal of u s forces by oct the stated goal is to remove most american combat brigades by next spring but no binding deadline is set and significant forces could remain to train iraqi units and pursue al qaeda terrorist elements in the interim full funding is provided for the increased troop levels requested by the president this spring and summer but the timetable is shorter than what the house first voted on and the fixed start date for a drawdown remains contentious mr bush who met with his baghdad commander army gen david petraeus again warned he would veto any measure that sets "an artificial timetable" for removing u s forces in response senate majority leader harry reid accused mr bush of being in a "state of denial" about the wars course and his administrations inability to impose a military solution "our strategy is a responsible strategically driven redeployment not a precipitous withdrawal " the nevada democrat said in a speech at the woodrow wilson center a nonpartisan think tank here mr reid appealed to antiwar elements in his party to allow more time to win over republicans and force a change in administration policy "the president has had a long time to dig the ditch were in " mr reid said "but were working very hard every day to dig out of that ditch " the house and senate hope to have the final package filed in time for congress to give its approval by the weekend but the bill itself may not be forwarded to the white house until early next week apart from the military funds &# billion is provided for the state department and foreign aid accounts including funding added by lawmakers to deal with the burgeoning crisis of refugees leaving iraq across the board democrats have sought to shift dollars where possible in the direction of afghanistan for example &# million is added for military operations there and almost &# million more is provided within foreign aid accounts even as iraq aid is reduced from the amount the president requested while most debate has focused on u s policy in iraq the cost of the package is a second flash point for the white house negotiators stripped out the more controversial pieces such as funding for spinach and sugar cane producers and peanut warehousing that have invited ridicule from conservatives but the bill is still &# billion richer than the administrations request and the white house accuses the new democratic majority of trying to steal a step going into the debate over the budget which kicks in after oct nonetheless major elements are tempting to the administration more than half of the &# billion about &# billion falls under the heading of defense homeland security and veterans medical care the &# billion provided for defense overall for example is a &# billion increase over mr bushs request and after behind the scenes lobbying by the military it includes a &# billion down payment toward the future purchase of armored vehicles given u s casualties from explosive devices these mine resistant ambush protected vehicles have become a major priority and a challenge to produce quickly as of late last year the military wanted vehicles for a total cost of about &# billion the projected requirement now has grown to more than for a cost of &# billion by making an upfront commitment supporters hope to give contractors such as oshkosh truck corp and textron inc s textron marine &amp land systems the confidence to commit to large scale production elsewhere in the bill money to close military bases and to prepare for the threat of avian flu are both requests the administration has made in either its or budgets and in the area of homeland security the bill includes &# million for improved aviation security and the purchase and installation of explosive detection devices at high priority airports
