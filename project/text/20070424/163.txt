politics &amp economics seeking clues to obamanomics democratic candidate is just beginning to fill in the blanks washington barack obama is known mainly for his biography his charisma and his early opposition to the iraq war on many issues particularly economics the democratic presidential candidate is just beginning to fill in the blanks the emerging picture shows a politician willing to use the government to intervene in markets to further core democratic goals though careful to avoid hard edged liberal rhetoric one example of how the illinois democrat might approach economic policy is an unusual bill he first introduced to little notice shortly after entering the senate in and reintroduced last week the "health care for hybrids" proposal would offer federal assistance to car makers struggling with hefty retiree health care costs in exchange for their building more fuel efficient automobiles the legislation requires no sacrifice from labor unions and essentially allows washington to set environmental goals for a powerful industry the liberal american prospect magazine singled out the proposal last year in a list of policy ideas it found promising "obama has come up with an audacious proposal " while mr obamas economic platform is still in its formative stages interviews with his aides and a review of his congressional record and speeches suggest that obamanomics may place him somewhat to the left of new york sen hillary rodham clinton but to the right of former north carolina sen john edwards another rival for the nomination mrs clinton seems to be cultivating the centrist mantle her husband won during his presidency while mr edwards is courting the partys labor and grassroots activist base mr obamas views seem to be tempered by president clintons strong push in the s to steer the democratic party toward the center away from the partys prior support for protectionism and rhetoric about class warfare yet mr obama has voted against a trade agreement and backs policies that redistribute income by taking revenue from the wealthiest to fund programs for middle and lower income households like most democrats he favors rolling back at least the portion of the bush tax cuts that favor upper income families "his view is not that the rich are doing too well " says one economic adviser "but he wants to finance some of the programs to help the poor do better and the resources have to come from where people are doing better " mr obamas brief senate record can be hard to pigeonhole in he voted for a bill making it easier for defendants to move class action lawsuits into federal court he explained his vote at the time by saying he didnt want plaintiffs shopping for sympathetic judges and thought large settlements often benefited the lawyers over the plaintiffs but the measure was opposed by the democratic partys big trial lawyer backers california democratic rep nancy pelosi who is now speaker of the house criticized the measure then as an "injustice" to consumers because it would make it harder to bring claims as mr obama prepares for his first series of domestic policy speeches in the coming weeks he appears to be still shopping for a place on the political spectrum one top economic adviser is jeffrey liebman a harvard economist and former adviser to president clinton who is focused heavily on the earned income tax credit and its role in moving people from welfare to work the candidate is also consulting with university of chicago economics professor austan goolsbee a taxation expert and centrist democrat who has advised mr obama since his senate campaign david cutler a harvard economist specializing in health policy who served in the clinton administration is also among mr obamas advisers one of the dominant economic questions hanging over the democratic primary contest is the push for universal health care every major candidate has embraced the goal but differences are emerging over how to get there mr obama hasnt yet settled on the specifics of his health care plan but aides say he isnt interested in doing away with the current employer based model of health insurance and may not favor mandates requiring that individuals purchase coverage that differs from mr edwards the only major candidate so far to unveil a health plan mr edwardss proposal would require that all individuals buy coverage "once insurance is affordable" and require businesses to cover their employees or help finance their health insurance still mr obama goes further than mrs clinton pledging to have all individuals covered by the end of his first term she says it will take eight years to achieve that goal mr obama is looking for ways to drive down costs possibly by creating state or national health care pools and offering hospitals and doctors financial incentives to convert to electronic record keeping among his health care goals is to keep costs low for business and find ways to "ensure that business can compete in a global economy and that not all the costs are being beared by individuals " an aide said in his book "the audacity of hope " mr obama proposes having a nonpartisan group design high quality cost effective health coverage which individuals could purchase through pools with private insurers competing for their business mr obama also plans during the campaign to talk at length about trade and to craft policies that seek to assist those whose jobs are eliminated as a result in his book mr obama called for revamping and better funding programs such as unemployment insurance and trade adjustment assistance in the biggest trade vote during his senate tenure mr obama voted against the central american free trade agreement along with many other democrats but aides said mr obama isnt planning to campaign on antitrade rhetoric as some democrats did in the congressional elections
