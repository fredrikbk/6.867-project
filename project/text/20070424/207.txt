waiting anxiously to see whether mr jobs would get snared in the options probe ms heinens legal team had indicated that she will battle the secs charges by arguing that the contested options were approved either by apples board or by mr jobs himself but many analysts seem to think that the charging of ms heinen represents a denouement in apples options saga bill shope an analyst at j p morgan

worry on investors part but former apple finance chief fred anderson who settled with the sec over his alleged participation in the backdating scheme by agreeing to pay a fine of &# and repay option gains of about &# million claimed that he warned mr jobs about the accounting implications of backdating options he said in a statement released today that he cautioned that changing the grant date could result in an accounting charge and that mr jobs had provided assurance that the companys board had previously approved the dating mr anderson said the grant date was selected by mr jobs and ms heinen the sec said it will not pursue any further action against apple itself which cooperated fully with the probe the u s attorneys office in san francisco is also sniffing around apples options
