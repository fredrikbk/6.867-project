health a special report can flying make you sick on an american airlines flight last week from new york to seattle traveler jim sullivan noticed the flight attendants preparing to serve a meal he grabbed a bottle of hand cleanser and began wiping down the tray table in front of him "a flight attendant i know told me how filthy these things are " he says indeed at a time when airplanes are often packed to capacity with travelers from around the world its no wonder that travelers start to worry about their exposure to germs and disease with headlines warning of bird flu and cruise ship outbreaks passengers are more nervous than ever about who and what is really sharing their seat space but surprisingly travel health experts say airplanes typically dont pose any bigger health or germ exposure risk than any other public place the best advice to stay healthy while flying wash hands often and drink lots of bottled water here are answers to some common questions about the health risks of travel and what airlines are doing to battle germs on board q can i catch an illness from the passenger sitting next to me or from germs left by a sick passenger on the flight before me a travelers can catch an illness just from being on a plane but its not likely says marlene zuk an evolutionary biologist at the university of california riverside who studies the interaction between diseases and their hosts "theyre more likely to catch something at work because theyre coming in closer contact with their co workers " and just sitting in a seat that an ill person has been in isnt likely to get you sick the human body is constantly bombarded with microbes dr zuk says most of which the immune system fights off there is a risk to having spray particles land on you such as from a sneeze since they can enter your body if you wipe that area of your skin on your nose or eyes respiratory droplets cant penetrate your skin though dr zuk says experts recommend carrying hand gels to clean your hands in case you cant use the restroom if youre sitting next to someone whos sick you can ask to be reseated several airlines say that if theres a seat available they will reseat passengers upon request q how often do airlines clean their planes what about pillows and blankets a for the most part only surface cleaning is done at the gate american airlines says that different work is done depending on the mileage flown and the ground time available but that it mostly involves picking up trash folding blankets and replenishing provisions british airways says that it cleans its seats replaces the headrests and vacuums the floors in addition to other measures after every flight northwest airlines says its aircraft undergo an additional cleaning every night which includes vacuuming cleaning windows and wiping down bins and other surfaces deep cleaning a more intensive process that can include scrubbing the seats cleaning the air vents and changing upholstery is done on a schedule that varies from airline to airline in recent years some airlines have lengthened their intervals jetblue airways deep cleaning cycle is now every days which has been the industry standard jetblues schedule used to be every days austrian airlines intensive cleaning is every days us airways cycle is every days pillows and blankets can go just as long without being washed ata airlines which says that its deep cleaning cycle is every days also says that blankets are cleaned every days and as needed us airways says that its blankets are washed at least every five days regardless of condition american replaces its pillow cases during its overnight cleaning and removes soiled or damaged blankets one way to ensure that youre getting a clean blanket is to snare one that is wrapped in plastic most airlines say that means the blanket is either new or freshly washed as for headphones most airlines say they distribute only new ones again though the experts say the only significant risk with blankets is if theyre soiled and if the germs enter your body q is the water from the taps on planes safe a in the environmental protection agency tested the drinking water on randomly selected passenger planes and found that tested positive for total coliform bacteria since then multiple airlines agreed to improve the testing and disinfection still the water from the tap in airplane bathrooms is effective for washing your hands but not intended for drinking says dr christie reed travelers health team lead at the centers for disease control airlines typically use bottled water for their beverage service although those supplies have been known to run out q is the air on airplanes safe a travelers worry about airplane air because its often dry because the environment is usually cramped and because it seems that the germs released by passengers coughs and sneezes have nowhere to go but the air on planes is better than in most home and office environments experts say since it changes much more frequently on most commercial planes at least half of the air comes from outside the aircraft and passes through a high efficiency particulate air or hepa filter which removes contaminants
