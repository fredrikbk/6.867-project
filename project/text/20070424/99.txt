health a special report heartbeat overweight and overlooked a hidden heart risk for kids heart researchers say they have uncovered a surprising development in the obesity epidemic overweight children who go undiagnosed at the doctors office but who are in fact in the early stages of heart disease at cincinnati childrens hospital medical center researchers found that a number of kids viewed as normal healthy children by their parents and even the medical staff at the hospital were later found to have enlarged hearts a thickening in the wall of the main pumping chamber even some children under years old showed signs of the condition known as left ventricular hypertrophy or lvh when researchers went back later to look for clues they calculated these childrens body mass indexes and found that many were actually overweight research has previously detected enlarged hearts in children but generally in those who were clearly obese what surprised the cincinnati childrens researchers is that they found lvh in children whom doctors hadnt initially deemed overweight given the attention on childhood obesity today how could doctors not notice that these kids were heavy one argument is that there are so many of them "weve grown so accustomed to an overweight child walking into the exam room that weve lost our visual representation of what a normal child is supposed to look like " says tom kimball a pediatric cardiologist at the hospital in short overweight is the new "normal " doctors rarely look for enlarged hearts in kids but in adults lvh is an important sign of heightened risk of cardiovascular disease the worry in kids is that left unmanaged these early physical changes to the heart could set children on a life course for premature coronary artery disease and heart attacks "we found that kids we consider normal actually are not from a cardiovascular standpoint " says sandy witt a cardiac sonographer at cincinnati childrens "but no one is alerting the children or the families even for the physician it is going under the radar " spurred by the concerns about overlooked obesity in kids ms witt and her colleagues conducted further research that showed an overall rise in childrens bmis in recent years and linked high bmi with risk for an enlarged heart the report which researchers presented at the recent american college of cardiology meeting in new orleans is based on a comparison of children that doctors viewed as normal during the past three years with a similar group from the late s the findings heighten the stakes in an already intense struggle under way in homes schools and communities over how to encourage kids and their families to change eating exercise and other habits to promote better health dr kimball says fewer cases of overweight children would be missed if doctors routinely calculated their patients body mass index a ratio based on height and weight both the american academy of pediatrics and the u s centers for disease control and prevention recommend doctors chart and track bmi for children but the indicator isnt perfect and for a variety of reasons not widely used dr kimball says for one muscle mass can vary widely in kids though there are exceptions those whose bmi is above the th percentile for their age are generally considered overweight above the th percentile is at risk of being overweight dr kimball and his colleagues conducted the study after making a curious observation among some seemingly normal children who were recruited to serve as a control group for a clinical study the trial was to look at the effect of high blood pressure on childrens hearts as part of the assessment researchers took the kids height weight and blood pressure but didnt calculate their bmi or otherwise identify them as overweight they didnt look overweight says ms witt the sonographer but when the researchers performed an echocardiogram an ultrasound image of the heart they found that in many of the kids their hearts were enlarged "none of these kids seemed to be somebody who would have that " she says in trying to understand why the childrens hearts were enlarged researchers calculated the bmis "they all seemed like normal healthy kids but when we calculated their bmi they werent normal " many of these recruits were children of doctors and other staff at the hospital when they were told about the echocardiogram findings "it came as a surprise to them " says ms witt the researchers figured that a look at a previous generation of the hospitals patients might offer an answer she says using the hospitals database they culled data on children between the ages of and who had undergone echocardiogram exams between and a period shortly before the sharp rise in childhood obesity began and kids of similar age from the current era to all told the study included boys and girls the kids had all been deemed healthy from a cardiovascular standpoint kids in each group had been evaluated for heart murmurs or chest pain that turned out not to have a cardiac cause and they had been found to be free of any signs of heart disease the researchers compared them on both bmi and what their echocardiograms revealed about thickening in their left ventricles body mass index among kids in the most recent group was on average compared with in the group from the s the echocardiograms revealed a increase in left ventricular mass in the current group compared with their earlier counterparts while body mass in children is influenced by numerous factors the researchers said that even after accounting for two prominent ones male gender and age the higher body mass index among the kids in the study correlated significantly with enlarged hearts "the higher your bmi the worse your hypertrophy " dr kimball says exactly what impact that has on future risk isnt clear "i dont think anybody has data on how this would translate into cardiovascular issues as adults " dr kimball says but it was enough to prompt him to change his practice he now carefully charts his patients bmi and counsels them and their parents about weight losing strategies the study has limitations for one it looked at a limited nonrandom group of kids all treated at cincinnati childrens and mostly from southwestern ohio and northern kentucky but christopher bolling medical director of the hospitals weight management center who was in private practice until months ago believes many kids arent getting appropriate advice in community doctors offices either "pediatricians dont know how to bring it up with parents " dr bolling says "theyre afraid to alienate them or they dont know where to send them" for help the good news is that other research indicates that by losing weight kids can reverse the deleterious physical effects on the heart as well as other weight related risks for cardiovascular disease in a recent study of extremely obese adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery to treat their condition weight loss led to a shrinking of the hypertrophy says holly ippisch a pediatric cardiologist also at cincinnati childrens she says such benefits would occur regardless of how children shed weight "the important thing is to lose the weight " she says
