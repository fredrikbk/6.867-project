moving the market has abn amro sold lasalle bank as a spoiling tactic its a reasonable question given the dutch banks desire to persuade shareholders to support its &lt euro&gt billion or &# billion merger with barclays in the face of a potential counterbid from a group led by royal bank of scotland lending credence to suspicions of a stitch up are the finances of bank of americas &# billion purchase of the chicago lender they look sweet indeed for the charlotte n c bank abn has some explaining to do consider the arithmetic bank of america is paying about &# billion after subtracting out capital that lasalle has on hand but doesnt need for regulatory purposes thats not inexpensive at a hearty multiple of more than times projected earnings but vector in the potential for massive cost savings and the deal stacks up nicely bank of america estimates it can fillet &# million out of lasalles costs fold these in and the price drops to times earnings bank of america says it can harvest another in revenue over time add these synergies to bank of americas projections for lasalles earnings and the deal is expected to generate an annualized rate of return of some thats quite a payoff but does that mean its a sweetheart deal not necessarily abn has offered a two week window for rival bids to emerge and the break up fee that abn would need to pay bank of america if it accepts a higher bid for lasalle is reasonably low at &# million or just under of the size of the deal the trouble is that abn hasnt disclosed the terms under which the lasalle deal could be terminated it wont even say whether a rival bidder for abn itself could stop the lasalle deal from happening this matters because royal bank desperately wants to own lasalle indeed the willingness of royal bank and partners fortis and banco santander central hispano to pay as much as more than barclays for abn is predicated on nabbing lasalle abn may not have stitched up the sale to bank of america to ward off royal bank but it needs to lift the veil on the deal to prove it to skeptical shareholders astrazeneca plays icahn carl icahn was right after all the activist investor bought a stake in biotech firm medimmune in february and pressured management to sell he hoped that the worlds top drug companies desperate for growth would pay a high price anglo swedish pharmaceutical giant astrazeneca has done just that its &# billion offer represented a staggering premium over medimmunes share price of course a good deal for a seller is always a more questionable proposition for the buyer astrazeneca is paying around times estimated cash flow it expects to achieve &# million in annual synergies within two years equivalent to of sales but even so astrazeneca could still only expect to achieve a meager return on the acquisition nonetheless theres some method in what looks like astrazenecas madness the drug maker is beset by woes common to big drugs companies ailing pipelines patent expirations and slow revenue growth so medimmune the seventh largest biotech group looked attractive its a one stop shop with a state of the art production line a portfolio of projects two of which are near fruition and a couple of existing blockbusters also unlike most of its peers its top products dont have provisions that give medimmunes partners the right to acquire its drugs if the company is sold a big success in biotech would help solve astrazenecas growth problems medimmunes earnings are forecast to grow annually through almost three times the rate of its rivals but biotech is still a tricky business and medimmunes pipeline isnt terribly strong for late stage drugs mr icahn has squeezed value out of the company now its astrazenecas turn to try rob cox and una galani
