harsh medicine earnings digest thai showdown spotlights threat to drug patents abbott protests move to buy copycat pills but it yields on price bangkok thailand this january the thai government sent the kind of letter that every global pharmaceutical company dreads to receive "dear patent holder " read the letter to abbott laboratories maker of the aids drug kaletra "as protected by its patent and monopolized by your company kaletra is very costly " therefore the letter went on thailand was preparing to break abbotts patent so it could import or produce cheaper copies of the drug since then abbott has been locked in a tug of war with thailand that underscores how developing countries have become a battleground over patent rights abbott brought on a storm of bad publicity by revoking plans to bring new drugs to thailand including its latest version of kaletra activists called that the "nuclear option" and said it was unprecedented for a drug company to withhold medicines from a country over a commercial dispute now abbott is partly backing down the company said over the weekend it is willing to sell the new version of kaletra in thailand at a deeply discounted price that it offers some other countries so long as the government respects its patent its unclear whether the thai government will accept the offer global drug makers are increasingly looking to emerging markets to compensate for slowing growth in the u s europe and japan abbotts troubles in thailand suggest that cracking the new markets can be tough because governments are driving a hard bargain on price they are using the threat of breaking patents to get good deals thailand has won the support of nonprofit groups and world organizations while meeting little resistance from the u s government "weve been talking with the drug companies for four years about reducing the price of treatment but with no result " says thailands health minister mongkol na songkhla "now we have no choice " thailand has already brought in its first shipment of copies of efavirenz a merck &amp co aids drug whose patent it broke abbott and other drug makers argue that without protection for their intellectual property drug makers have no incentive to develop lifesaving medicines in the first place teera chakajnarodom who represents the multinational drug industrys trade group in bangkok calls thailands move "very shortsighted " some pharmaceutical executives question thailands real motives suggesting the governments military installed government which took power in a coup last year is using populist rhetoric and policies to curry favor with the thai people dr mongkol says that as a physician its his duty to look after patients needs he adds "im not a thief " a number of emerging nations are working on plans to slash drug costs lawmakers in the philippines are debating legislation that would permit breaking patents in certain circumstances and allow the country to use more generic drugs to fight aids and potential pandemics kenya is considering breaking patents as dr mongkol has done to open the door to cheaper copies in an interview last week indonesias u s educated trade minister mari elka pangestu said her country might introduce price caps to bring the price of branded drugs closer to the level of generic equivalents "the difference in price between nongenerics and generics is perceived to be too high " ms pangestu said such moves could threaten the ambitions of drug companies in developing nations especially those such as thailand that are growing wealthier while the u s europe and japan account for the vast majority of sales at big western drug makers their growth is slowing the u s this year will contribute about of total growth in pharmaceutical sales down from five years ago according to a forecast by ims health a research and consulting firm merck has said that it expects revenue in key emerging markets including china india and eastern europe to reach &# billion by double the level abbotts sales in the u s dropped in to &# billion but it made up for that with growth in international sales to &# billion supachai suwannasit is typical of the patient these companies would like to attract he is a year old administrator at a bangkok media firm to treat his chronic back pain mr supachai first used cheap generic drugs which were covered by his limited insurance policy then he opted to spend more of his own money for brand name drugs made by western companies "the brand name drugs were much more effective in relieving the pain it was worth paying more to use them " says mr supachai thailand began inching toward its confrontation with the pharmaceutical industry in when it pledged to provide free aids medicine to everyone who needed it at the time thailand was beginning to introduce a government funded health care system to provide basic care for all citizens along the lines of universal health care systems in europe and other developed regions with a half million thais suffering from hiv infection the drugs loomed as a major cost dr mongkol then a senior bureaucrat in thailands health ministry discussed the issue with aids activist wirat purahong a former sugar cane cutter who nearly died of aids six years ago before he was placed on a government short list of people who could be treated mr wirat argued that breaking patents was the only way to bring down prices over time that view gained a friendly hearing last year the world bank told thailand it would have to consider breaking patents if it was serious about including aids treatment in its new health program the united nationss aids agency also sent a letter of support when the military took power in september exiling pro business prime minister thaksin shinawatra dr mongkol was appointed thailands new health minister he quickly seized his chance to push for cheaper aids drugs in november his deputies began sending out letters to foreign patent holders the letters said thailand was planning to create what is called a compulsory license compelling the patent holder to license its patent to the thai government the move amounts to a seizing of patent rights once the government holds the license it is free to import copies of the patented product or make the product itself the thai government has a drug manufacturing arm that is capable of copying foreign drugs although it typically turns first to generic drug makers in places like india thailand says it is obeying the rules of the world trade organization which allows compulsory licenses in a national emergency or cases where the member country needs the drug for noncommercial use critics of thailand say the loophole was designed only for extreme cases such as a country that faces pandemic flu and needs to produce vast quantities of a patented antiflu drug the first letter went to merck on nov informing the company that thailand was planning to import a generic version of its aids drug efavirenz the drug is sold in the u s by bristol myers squibb co under the brand name sustiva merck protested but then dropped its price in february it announced it was reducing the price of efavirenz by in poor countries and in some wealthier countries including thailand that have especially severe aids problems merck says that at the current price cents a day per patient it makes no profit it says it is committed to reaching a negotiated agreement with the thai government nonetheless thailand pushed ahead with imports of generic efavirenz the government recently received bottles of a copycat version of efavirenz made by indias ranbaxy laboratories ltd it paid less than half the price of the brand name drug prior to the price cut two months after the merck letter it was abbotts turn to receive a compulsory license notice this time about kaletra abbott was supposed to meet with thai health ministry officials on monday jan to discuss price reductions for kaletra but one of dr mongkols assistants called a few hours before to cancel the meeting the minister had made his decision clear in a letter to abbott the previous friday so there was nothing to discuss abbott was hoping it could still reach a deal on price that would preserve its patent it had faced a similar battle in brazil in over kaletra that ended when abbott agreed to reduce the price by brazil withdrew its threat to revoke the patent in the summer of abbott cut the yearly price of kaletra in some countries including thailand to &# and it says it was prepared to make further reductions the drug costs about &# a year in the u s senior abbott executives flew to bangkok and met feb with a thai team led by suwit wibulpolprasert special adviser to dr mongkol according to jennifer smoter an abbott spokeswoman dr suwit told the company that "regardless of wherever you price this drug we will continue the compulsory license " abbott criticizes this stance saying it shows thailands contempt for patents and unwillingness to negotiate "some would like to make this an hiv issue but the fact is its not " miles white abbotts chief executive said sunday in an interview "its clear that this continues to be about compulsory licensing and the potential for its abuse " thai officials while not commenting directly on the recent discussions with abbott say they tried to get the companys attention for years and the best way to ensure low prices now is to move ahead with breaking the patent dr suwit says its risky to commit to a fixed price deal with drug companies because what looks like a good buy now may become less so if the cost of the drug in generic form goes down the u s government has mostly stayed on the sidelines during the dispute in a january letter to a congressman who had expressed concern about the efavirenz move u s trade representative susan schwab said washington isnt accusing thailand of breaking world trade rules and has "taken care to respect fully the thai governments ability to issue compulsory licenses" in accordance with wto obligations on feb dr mongkol held a news conference in bangkok and told reporters that thailand was considering breaking patents on other drugs including treatments for aids infections cancer and heart problems abbott executives in chicago heard about the news conference from an article in an english language thai newspaper the following day thai officials quickly backed away saying that while they reserved the right to break patents they didnt have any immediate plans to do so broadly abbott took the newspaper report at face value "this told us that price doesnt matter that this is about busting the patent system " says mr white abbott decided to strike back it was in the midst of seeking approval for seven drugs at thailands food and drug administration but it pulled all seven applications they included drugs for arthritis high blood pressure and other conditions one of the applications was for aluvia a new version of kaletra the active ingredients in the two drugs are identical but aluvia is formulated so that it doesnt need to be refrigerated thats a big advantage in thailand and other developing countries where many people dont own a refrigerator doctors without borders and other activist groups let loose on abbott calling its strategy callous paul cawthorne doctors without borders representative in bangkok says "i think abbott got some very bad advice from their pr people " together with mr wirat and his group doctors without borders has been organizing a consumer boycott of abbotts existing products in thailand in the u s a handful of abbott investors in faith based investment groups also criticized managements decision saying it could damage the companys reputation and hurt business prospects in developing countries on april abbott showed signs that it was preparing to back down at least partially after talks with the world health organization abbott said it was willing to sell kaletra to several developing countries including thailand for &# so long as they kept its patent intact dr mongkol and mr wirat were unimpressed at that point abbott was still refusing to reinstate its application in thailand to sell aluvia the heat resistant version of kaletra "its just a business tactic to make them look better " mr wirat complained in an interview at the time under abbotts most recent concession it has offered to reinstate its aluvia application and when approved sell the drug for &# a year in thailand if its patent is respected however abbott continues to hold back the other six applications "we are willing to have discussions to come to a solution but we have not backed down on" protecting intellectual property says melissa brotz a spokeswoman for the company the matter remains unresolved if thailand were to accept abbotts offer it would have to undo the compulsory license which it has shown no signs of being willing to do cipla ltd of india makes a copycat version of kaletra and is working on a copy of aluvia "let the multinationals go " says yusuf hamied ciplas chairman "we will supply whatever drugs the thai or other governments may want " tom wright paul beckett wilawan watcharasakwet and sarah rubenstein contributed to this article
