tight spreads are emerging cost of protecting debt in brazil peru falls to new lows these days insuring against a default by emerging market governments is far less costly than their reputation might suggest the price of protection for emerging market sovereign debt has dropped to record low levels just as risk premiums for cash bonds have also fallen to historically tight spreads brazils five year credit default swaps are currently trading around a record tight spread of percentage point meaning it would cost &# to insure &# million in the speculative grade bonds at the beginning of the year brazils five year cdss were trading at about one full percentage point cdss are derivatives that enable people to either buy or sell protection against bond defaults by comparison boston scientific corp an investment grade company trades at a spread of about percentage point five year cdss for colombia are at percentage point while peru is at percentage point even turkey which has generally underperformed other emerging market names and continues to grapple with political uncertainty is hovering near record tight levels at percentage points meanwhile the benchmark cdx emerging markets index is at just under one full point roughly percentage point less than a month ago the index comprises individual credit default swaps and generally narrows when market participants have a positive credit outlook participants said some of the most heavily traded emerging market cdss now boast deeper liquidity and tighter spreads between bids and offers than the market for cash bonds as a result cdss are now taking the lead in reflecting market sentiment "in the past bond prices would drive cds spreads now you could argue its the other way around although many times the two markets diverge because of different technicals driving them on a certain day " said gautam jain a strategist at barclays capital a major underlying factor driving the positive sentiment in emerging markets is what new york based research firm ideaglobal called in a note yesterday a "bottomless pit" when it comes to risk appetite ample liquidity has sent investors chasing after higher yielding assets even from countries with checkered financial histories on j p morgans emerging markets bond index plus brazil is up for the year and its spread at percentage points above u s treasurys is close to a record tight level the overall embi+ is at about percentage points above treasurys also very close to its record level with year to date returns at as of fridays close solid economic fundamentals and persistent chatter over the potential for sovereign credit upgrades are buoying both cdss and external bonds the strongest performers among latin american names are brazil peru and colombia all countries that investors perceive as nearing coveted investment grade status even if it may still take them a couple of years to get there the cds market is also drawing strength from elements that have little direct sway over the cash bonds themselves one factor is the growing popularity of cdss and the cdx index at a time when the pool of overseas sovereign debt is shrinking due to government bond buybacks "the index has become very liquid and thats the best instrument for investors to express their views on the market as a whole " mr jain said in addition emerging market cdss are playing a larger role in synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdos which are structured products that pool together cdss bonds loans and other assets cdo issuance "continues to be very strong and emerging markets are an important target for those deals because you get diversification benefits" from incorporating emerging market assets into the products said christian stracke an analyst at creditsights furthermore investors who dont normally trade emerging market assets are feeling increasingly comfortable using emerging markets derivatives that match a particular risk profile to hedge other positions and this has given spreads further impetus to tighten many analysts said the historical spread levels should give investors reason for caution yet "you could have said that a year ago" about emerging markets and spreads have tightened further since then noted matt meyer head of public credit markets at aig global investment group "we cant just say that its going to be valuation thats going to turn the market the other way " said mr meyer who helps manage about &# billion in emerging market debt treasurys advance ahead of weeks data treasury prices rose during a quiet session
