every business day sign up for the e mail here by the end of this week a now united house and senate plan to give president bush a chance to veto their own vision for a "way forward" on iraq a &# billion spending bill that requires the administration to begin withdrawing troops by oct and envisions a de facto iraqization of most battlefield activities democratic negotiators from the two chambers finished reconciling their competing bills yesterday and the result sets a goal of removing most forces within days the exception would be troops protecting u s facilities those fighting terrorism and the american forces training and equipping their iraqi counterparts the new york times reports the bill would also subject the iraqi government to benchmarks gauging its progress on disarming militias developing its securities force reconciling sunnis and shiites and the key task of divvying up oil revenues the times adds some democrats considered making the withdrawal dates advisory in hope of persuading mr bush to sign the bill but "with the president standing firm on his plans to veto any language on the timing of the war democratic leaders stuck to binding dates for initial troop pullouts " the washington post reports the bill provides &# billion for the activities in iraq and afghanistan more than the administration sought and fully covering its plans there for the spring and summer it sets aside &# billion for state department and foreign aid use including money added by the lawmakers to help the sea of refugees fleeing iraq the wall street journal says and where possible democrats tried to shift dollars toward afghanistan though the bill wont be as "clean" as mr bush wanted the democratic negotiators also dropped inclusion of two domestic spending projects he and congressional republicans considered inappropriate for the bill the hill reports it was the withdrawal dates though that drew mr bushs attention yesterday "an artificial timetable of withdrawal would say to an enemy just wait them out it would say to the iraqis dont do hard things necessary to achieve our objectives and it would be discouraging for our troops " he told reporters during a white house photo op with david petraeus the commander of u s forces in iraq the u s iraqi security crackdown in baghdad perhaps the most important part of mr bushs latest plan for victory in iraq is itself upsetting many iraqis as demonstrated by the governments resistance to u s construction of a wall in a neighborhood of baghdad it was supposed to separate clashing sunnis and shiites but has instead united them in ferocious opposition that reflected the "depths of iraqi frustration with the petty humiliations created by the new security plan intended to protect them " as the times describes it "the strong reaction underscores the sense of powerlessness iraqis feel in the face of the american military whose presence is all the more pervasive as an increasing number of troops move on to the citys streets " prime minister nouri al malikis denunciation of the wall came a day before american ground forces suffered what the associated press calls one of the deadliest attacks since the war began a suicide bombing at a patrol base north of baghdad that killed nine u s soldiers and wounded at least iraqis were killed in seven other bombings around the country yesterday events in iraq and the reaction among americans have clearly emboldened democrats in their willingness to challenge mr bushs veto threat and senate majority leader harry reid to even adopt mr bushs "way forward" language in describing plans to end the war in a speech last night as cited by the post but mr reid also had to acknowledge impatience within his own party with the prospect of bringing american troops home "i understand the restlessness that some feel many who voted for change in november anticipated dramatic and immediate results in january but like it or not george w bush is still the commander in chief and this is his war " toyota snatches gms global crown in the first three months of this year global auto sales by toyota motor exceeded those of general motors for the first

backdating the san jose mercury news reports attorneys for nancy heinen say shes a scapegoat in the investigation which has drawn attention amid the wider options backdating epidemic because options

the matter tell the journal part of the secs case against ms heinen involves a grant she herself received along with other top executives "because that proposed date was just prior to the big macworld

wants authority over violence on tv the federal communications commission plans to recommend that congress give the government "unprecedented powers to curb violence in entertainment programming" so it can mitigate the effects of tv violence on children the washington post reports fcc sources tell the post the fcc has decided it is in the publics interest to regulate television violence especially in shows aired between a m and p m the resulting regulations could set up what the post notes would be a "legal battle between washington and the television industry " since while the fcc has long penalized perceived indecency it has never had authority over the broadcasting of excessively violent programming the constitutional hurdles to such regulations though may be high especially for cable programming since consumers choose to buy it and even the defining of violence could be complicated goodbye to boris yeltsin a new york times editorial best summed up the shakespearian truth about boris yeltsin "it is in the nature of men who lead revolutions that they rarely prove to be effective leaders of governments " mr yeltsin captured the hearts and minds of fellow russians and the
