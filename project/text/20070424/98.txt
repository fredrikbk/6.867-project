health a special report health journal the man problem science confronts vexing issue of mens shorter life spans the waist size danger zone when it comes to health one of the biggest risks a man faces in his lifetime is being a man at every stage of life from infancy to the teen years to middle age a man is at far higher risk for getting sick and dying than a woman the average life expectancy of a man years is more than five years shorter than that of a woman the reasons for the troubled state of mens health are complex biology such as the different ways men and women react to stress likely plays a role and men taught since boyhood to be stoic in the face of pain often are their own worst enemy avoiding doctors and engaging in risky behaviors such as reckless driving that threaten health mens health issues also get less public attention and funding at a time when womens health concerns such as breast cancer are in the national spotlight theres now a growing effort by doctors and health researchers to bring more resources to improving mens health medical schools such as johns hopkins and columbia university have created departments devoted to gender specific medicine health groups are calling on congress to create an office of mens health similar to the current office of womens health established in men on their own can take a few simple steps to boost their health doctors say that by focusing on a few key areas blood pressure cholesterol waist size and sexual function a man can make dramatic improvements in his overall health one recent study in the medical journal jama found that preventing weight gain and alcohol abuse in midlife were two major factors in determining whether a man lived and stayed healthy until the age of "men need to know that they are vulnerable but that they can change things " says harvey b simon an internal medicine specialist and editor of the harvard mens health watch newsletter part of the problem is that for most of the past years issues of womens health have been the focus of government research and private advocacy in an effort to atone for years of neglect of women by the health care system in a seminal report from the u s public health service task force concluded that because women historically havent been included in medical research women often didnt receive quality information or health care to make amends the government in created the office of womens health and launched the &# million womens health initiative which was devoted to studying major womens health issues including menopause hormones calcium and dietary influences on breast cancer now some experts question whether the intense focus on women has had the unintended result of allowing mens health issues to slide for instance congress directed &# million to breast and ovarian cancer research from to more than the &# million it set aside for prostate cancer research during the same period according to data from the congressionally directed medical research programs office nobody thinks breast cancer should get less attention but there is growing concern that the big killers of men heart disease prostate cancer injuries and suicide arent getting equal billing even though men historically were over represented in research science still has not answered many questions about mens health says new york physician marianne j legato who was recently appointed adjunct professor at johns hopkins for gender specific medicine for instance why do men typically have more abdominal fat considered to be the most unhealthy type of body fat why do men have naturally lower hdl or "good" cholesterol than women why are men more vulnerable to heart disease at a younger age why are boy babies more likely to have health problems than girls on average men at any age are more likely to die than women a year old man for instance is three times as likely to die in an accident as a woman a year old man is more likely to die of diabetes and when diseases such as diabetes heart disease or hypertension are diagnosed in men they tend to be at a far later stage in the disease process after extensive damage has already been done one of the biggest obstacles to improving care for men may be men themselves boys and girls receive similar levels of pediatric care likely because their mothers are in charge of it but after males reach adulthood their participation in health care plummets a centers for disease control and prevention study found that even when visits for pregnancy are excluded women are twice as likely as men to schedule regular annual exams and use preventive services another survey found that three times as many men as women hadnt seen a doctor in the past year and one out of four men says he "waits as long as possible" before seeking help for a health problem according to harvard mens health watch one problem is that while obstetrics and gynecology are dedicated to womens health theres no specialty dedicated to men in surveys about of women report having a personal physician while only two thirds of men do "when women go to the gynecologist they dont just get gynecological problems diagnosed the doctor checks her for diabetes blood pressure depression " says jean bonhomme a preventive medicine doctor in atlanta and board member of the mens health network a nonprofit advocacy group "but we dont have anything analogous to that for men we need to use the opportunities we have to bring men back into the health care system " one such opportunity may be the success of erectile dysfunction drugs like pfizers viagra studies show that erection problems are one of the earliest warning signs of heart disease because the same unhealthy buildup that damages the arteries to the heart also damages the arteries to the penis last year the archives of internal medicine reported on a study of nearly canadian men that showed men with erectile dysfunction were nearly more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes or metabolic syndrome a collection of health risks that are associated with heart disease the link between erectile health and heart health has triggered a new push in the medical community to use the "viagra visit" the time when a man asks his doctor for an erectile dysfunction drug as a way to screen men for heart disease teaching a man that erectile function is linked to cardiovascular health diabetes and weight gain can help motivate him to make healthy lifestyle changes "sexual health is the portal to mens health " says ridwan shabsigh associate professor of urology at columbia university in new york two major health issues for men stress and depression exact a serious physical toll on men but are currently ignored by many doctors who treat men new research shows there may be major differences in the male stress reaction compared with the female stress response the typical stress response is called "fight or flight" a physical reaction to danger that helps the body rapidly mobilize energy delivering glucose to muscles and boosting the heart rate and blood pressure while the stress response protects us in the face of danger such as fighting a war or fleeing a burning house it causes damage if stress is chronic as is often the case with job deadlines and financial worries in recent years evidence has been mounting that women may be evolutionarily better equipped to cope with modern stress she can still fight or flee if necessary but in times of stress a womans body also releases oxytocin which is known as a bonding hormone this has been dubbed the "tend and befriend" stress response and may help explain why women are more likely to seek counseling and confide in friends and family during stressful times a unique female stress response makes evolutionary sense imagine an ancient village being invaded by marauders the men have to gear up to fight but the best strategy for a woman may have been to gather children close comfort them and surround herself with other women to help during the crisis though still only a theory this coping mechanism may help explain at least part of the reason why women overall are more healthy than men and in the case of depression twice as many women as men are diagnosed fueling the belief that depression is a womans health issue but many mental health researchers believe that the medical community is culturally biased to find depression in women and ignore it in men for instance one key question to diagnosing depression is to ask whether a patient has crying spells "we miss a lot of depression in men because we look for emotional expressions that men have been taught not to show " notes dr bonhomme "the first thing you learn as a young man is that men arent supposed to cry when women are depressed they may show sadness but a guy may go to a bar and line up a whole bunch of drinks " but missing depression in men has proved to be deadly suicide rates are four times higher for men than women according to the cdc and between the ages of and its the second leading cause of death among men it remains among the top five until the age of doctors say men have the most power to improve the state of their health with just a few simple steps first be aware of your blood pressure and cholesterol numbers and take active steps to lower both if they reach an unhealthy range "just focusing on those two single things can make a huge difference in longevity " says peter a gross chief medical officer at hackensack university medical center in new jersey "men may think theyre more indestructible than women when in fact we may be genetically inferior to women " next men need to be aware of their waist circumference abdominal fat has long been a risk factor for heart disease a waist size above inches for men inches for women puts you in a danger zone dont rely on your pant size and instead take out a tape measure "men say their pant size hasnt changed in years but they have this strategy of just lowering their belt " notes harvards dr simon "i think its another area of real ignorance among men " a recent jama study showed that preventing weight gain in men during midlife was also a major factor in predicting his longevity the same study showed that men with excessive alcohol consumption defined as three or more drinks a day were more likely to die before age or be unhealthy during their elderly years men dont have to give up alcohol altogether other studies show that one to two alcoholic beverages a day boosts a mans heart health fathers of young boys have the most to gain by taking charge of their health studies show boys tend to mimic the behavior of their dads while girls tend to copy their mothers so a dad who takes care of himself and makes regular doctor visits can have a big impact on his sons health as well and parents of both sexes can work to dissuade the risk taking behavior in boys and teens that puts young men at such high risk for accidental death teaching boys that its ok to cry and that they dont have to be stoic when hurt can go a long way toward protecting them as they age notes dr bonhomme "you dont have to retrain a whole society but for the ones that are coming up now we can take a different tact and raise them to be more health conscious " says dr bonhomme "when a boy is years old and skins his knee hes taught that if something hurts dont pay it any mind because it will go away that works when youre young but it doesnt work in middle age " email healthjournal wsj com the tune up heres a look at some basic lifestyle changes and screening tests that can help men improve their overall health at any age measure your waist your waistline is an important barometer of your heart health keep it below inches know your cholesterol get your cholesterol checked at the age of and keep checking regularly after that blood pressure check starting at age check your blood pressure at least every two years sexual
