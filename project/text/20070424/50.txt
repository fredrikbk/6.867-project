physicians and nurses have the tools they need to save lives " mr deal signed the email before sending it he says he printed out a copy and handed it to his boss "she gave me a look like i think youre going to be fired " he recalls soon afterwards his office phone was ringing off the hook it staffers later arrived to seize his computers and mr deal was placed on paid leave from his &# a year job kaiser refutes mr deals assessment of its custom software system developed by epic systems corp the company says healthconnect is doing fine despite some missteps ultimately the company fired mr deal

after the message hit kaiser sprang into action to assess the damage and figure out a response since the missive was sent on a friday it went unread by many employees who had left for the weekend kaisers it staff scrambled to delete it before workers returned to their desks but with little success by monday the mass mailing had reached an estimated computers at the company it had also leaked into cyberspace on monday mr halvorson sent his own kaiser wide email dismissing mr deals attack as "an unfortunate combination of partial facts old data incomplete data conspiracy thinking and naivete " earlier during the day kaiser had announced that j clifford dodd its chief information officer resigned the hmo said the timing was a coincidence and gave no reason for the executives departure attempts to reach mr dodd for comment were unsuccessful mr deal meanwhile quickly became a cause celebre in the blogosphere and beyond histalk a popular health care it site featured "an exclusive interview " with mr deal one stock analyst says that kaisers tribulations could alter the competitive landscape for it vendors soon after the email leak computerworld magazine ran a negative story about healthconnect based on a page internal kaiser document chronicling various problems with the system including power outages system failures and incomplete patient records that article prompted the california watchdog agency that oversees managed health care to send kaiser an inquiry letter in january about healthconnects reliability the agency says now that it is monitoring the systems performance but is satisfied that kaiser has taken "corrective action " andrew wiesenthal a physician overseeing the healthconnect project became worried about the buzz mr deal was generating in a counterpunch he offered an interview to matthew holt a well known health care blogger a few days later mr wiesenthal joined a podcast using his cellphone in the backseat of a taxi of the email he said "most of the things he raises are not true " kaiser officials unleashed other communications tactics to disseminate its side of the story on the web the company paid google to place a special kaiser link at the top of any page returning search results for "justen deal " in february kaiser launched its "kp news center " linked to the companys home page when the los angeles times ran a critical healthconnect story that echoed some of mr deals criticisms the site posted kaisers official response mr deal a well dressed young man who constantly sweeps his sandy hair across his forehead has been known to go against the grain as a teen in west virginia he testified before the state legislature in favor of gay rights and was mentioned in a front page washington post story at he dropped out of high school and later dropped out of college where he was studying journalism after stints performing administrative chores at a west virginia symphony and a gay rights group in ottawa he moved to los angeles to work for a travel agency while at kaiser on his own initiative he edited kaisers listing at the online encyclopedia wikipedia org until a public relations manager asked him to stop known to embellish kaisers listing with positive fodder he also got into skirmishes with a company basher who posted criticism about the hmo on the site mr deals department was involved with employee training on the healthconnect system mr deal says the "sheer cost" of the system caught his attention initially he then began pulling budget reports system engineering data and other documents from online systems "anyone at the company could have done it " he maintains he was particularly alarmed when he came across an internal projection that the organization could lose &# billion over the following two years "that kicked me into gear to dig more" into healthconnect he says his research led him to question the integrity of kaisers selection of its it vendor among other things he accused mr halvorson of mismanagement and mr dodd of undisclosed conflicts of interest that led to the selection of epic the outside vendor "their poor decisions are positioning us for potentially catastrophic failure " he wrote in a letter dated aug he sent the missive to the companys chief compliance officer as well as to each of kaisers board members a company investigation ensued kaisers assistant general counsel sent mr deal a letter saying that "a thorough investigation" found no evidence of misconduct by the executives nor of a "disastrous failure" of the healthconnect project mr deal wasnt satisfied thats when he decided to send the email but it wasnt as easy as pushing a button he didnt have access to a company wide "send all" address so he improvised he says he bought a cheap software tool that helped him gradually build a list on his own computer when kaiser switched mr deal to unpaid leave in december it appeared his job was in jeopardy he says he thought that would be protected by a kaiser policy intended to encourage people to report ethical or patient safety problems kaiser fired him on jan a company spokeswoman says he wasnt dismissed over the email flap but "rather because he violated numerous company policies including making an unauthorized order for three apple laptops that he converted to his own use " mr deal says the order was approved by superiors in his department these days mr deal helps friends with their computers and is looking for a job in february he was named "it industry figure of the year" by histalk based on an online
