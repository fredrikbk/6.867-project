business technology h p begins push into high end copiers prints made with ink a major source of profit overcoming the smudge businesses now have one more option for their copier room earlier this month hewlett packard co began pushing into what has traditionally been known as the high end copier market with two new multifunction color printers unlike most high end copiers which use the same technology as laser printers to copy and print documents at speeds of around pages a minute h ps new machines are the first in that market to use ink based technology the h p cm and cm printers which cost &# and &# respectively work by passing paper underneath a stationary print head that sprays on the ink color pages can be printed at speeds of to pages a minute like other devices in this space the h p machines can print copy fax and scan that gives businesses looking for high end copiers the option of an ink based machine for the first time but it may take some calculating for companies to figure out whether to get one while the h p devices are priced cheaper than the average &# cost of a high end copier companies dont generally buy such machines outright but rather lease them under a three to five year contract under such leases most high end copiers charge a fixed cost of about one cent a page to print a black and white document and eight to cents a page to print a color page h ps new machines differ in that they use a flexible pricing strategy the printers can measure exactly how much color ink is being used on a page and thus potentially charge less for pages that use less color ink analysts say but under any lease agreement such savings only kick in if the company is a high volume printer those companies that dont print often will end up paying the same price per print as with a high end copier says peter grant an analyst at gartner inc he figures businesses must print at least pages a year on the h p machines to qualify for prices as low as seven to eight cents to print a color page mike harris information services operations manager for clark public utilities in vancouver wash recently pilot tested one of the new h p machines for three months because the utility prints as many as pages a month it qualified for h ps lower pricing so when mr harris recently produced copies of a page manual for the utilitys service crews it cost &# using the h p machine by comparison it would have cost &# if the utility had used its existing laser print systems to do the job "we were able to do a lot better quality at a less price " says mr harris he adds the utility has already signed leases to use kyocera corp and ricoh co multifunction devices in but may add the h p printers to its office next year other businesses may see little reason to switch to the ink based devices most companies are comfortable with their existing laser based technology and have established relationships with copier vendors such as xerox corp and ricoh ink is also relatively untested in the copier space indeed gartners mr grant says the new h p printers dont work well with certain higher end glossy paper because the ink cant dry fast enough causing documents to smudge h p says it designs and sells its own heavy glossy paper that work with its printers and doesnt recommend the use of other coated papers cracking the copier market is crucial to h ps growth strategy while the palo alto calif company has strong positions in ink and laser based printing it wants to spur growth by pushing into areas where it has little presence the high end color copier market where machines can pump out pages to pages a minute is tiny less than such devices sold last year but sales are projected to grow at about a year through gartner says the new machines give h p another way to sell more ink long a major source of the companys profits "ink is the crown jewel of h ps printing division " says gartners mr grant in the fiscal first quarter ended jan sales for h ps printing group totaled &# billion up from a year earlier the groups profit margins were up from a year earlier h p has tried to penetrate the high end copier market before but past efforts including a line of hybrid printer copiers called "mopiers" in the mid s and a partnership with konica minolta holdings inc to develop digital copiers didnt take off says robert palmer analyst for infotrends inc in h p had of the u s market for multifunction color products that print up to pages a minute according to gartner leader ricoh had a share since october h p says it has hired hundreds of new salespeople to help displace its rivals machines h p printing executives have met with potential customers and resellers in seven u s cities over the past two months to pitch them on the new printers the company also has an advertising campaign around the new products still it may take more to get companies to throw out their existing copiers for the h p machines todd mansfield a systems engineering team leader for ecco group a boise idaho equipment maker for commercial vehicles says he found the h p printers easy to use and service during a recent pilot test of the machines but ecco which uses konica minolta copiers still is trying to figure out whether it will save money by leasing the h p printers eccos engineering team prints pages a month or around pages a year slightly less than the pages a year that it takes to get cheaper h p pricing "i would say we are investigating it the new printers " mr mansfield says "i cant go as far as saying we are planning on it "
