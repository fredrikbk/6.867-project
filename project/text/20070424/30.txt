bookshelf by david a shaywitz santa barbara calif its a m on a monday and dr bill koonce is already making his rounds i follow as he checks on his first "patient " but were not at the hospital and hes not doing any curing here the good doctor is on "gopher patrol " dressed in army fatigues work boots and ace hardware gloves dr koonce is ensuring that his vast plant collection doesnt get eaten stay tuned for the details but please eat your breakfast first with his real doctoring occupying to hours per week youd think dr koonce would spend his off hours golfing but the year old internist is a gardening aficionado fanatic is more like it for unlike someone whod buy a trowel from smith &amp hawken dr koonce isnt merely pruning a few rosebushes or trimming the front lawn his brand of botany requires battling one of natures toughest offerings the chaparral covered terrain of southern california sure while east coasters california dreaming evokes images of drapey palm trees and rainbow displays of bougainvillea the reality of the california terrain is an entirely different matter rock hard soils searing sun and skin piercing plants are enough to make even martha stewart cower no horticulture even in this hideaway for hollywood stars is not for the faint of heart or weak of muscle thanks to burly forearms and an insouciant can do anything demeanor dr koonce is well equipped to meet that challenge "i dont see this as a chore " he says "to me its recreation its really relaxing to have a weekend and come out and pull weeds" which he continues doing as we talk the result a private botanical garden known only to his patients neighbors and gardening cohorts good thing he might have people lining up along his driveway to sneak a peak not that he would mind but dr koonces acre property is perched way up along one of santa barbaras most remote roads which dead ends just shy of the los padres national forest surveying the countless varieties of palms along with tangerine mexican lime blood orange apple mango and some avocado trees that punctuate his "yard " you think youve seen it all but dr koonces real effort is manifested in the half acre terraced succulent garden that extends just below his house facing south toward the shimmering pacific its difficult to decide what to focus on the degree view that captures both the channel islands and the santa ynez mountains or the intricate layers of colors and textures created by the juxtaposition of aloes sedum and other drought tolerant specimens including rare and endangered species carefully arranged in front of the granite slabs and steps that house them ten years in the making dr koonces "african mediterranean desertscape" was a mostly do it yourself project he had help from his year old gardener and the occasional laborer built from mostly scrounged materials "remember the stearns wharf fire " he asks me pointing to a piece of weathered wood salvaged from santa barbaras waterfront landmark that is now holding up a wall and though part of the reason he scavenges is to save money dr koonce believes recycling means more than just separating out some plastic bottles "boy when i drive down the street and see some construction guys ripping out some year old sandstone curbing my eyes light up i just gotta stay calm and act like its nothing special and then ask if i can just have it or offer the guy some money its always kind of fun to negotiate like that " he says the curbing isnt always easy to come by so dr koonce sometimes cuts his own himself the ever resourceful physician learned how by reading books and talking to a few stonemasons "basically you get a boulder and then score it with diamond blade " he says "how long does that take " i ask he casually says "four hours " he refers to his technique as "caveman instinctive " despite dr koonces lack of formal training in landscape design his concept works the sandstone is the same stuff that colors the faces of the tallest peaks in the distance dr koonce also scavenges plants his eyes widen as he tells me how he procured one of his prized specimens a foot high dracaena draco a yucca like tree that seems a cast off from jurassic park after learning from some tree trimmer friends that it was going to be cut down dr koonce went to the construction site "i offered to take it away and the contractor at first said sure " then he says well its gotta be worth something i said youre just gonna tear it down and he said "whats gonna stop me from putting it in the dumpster " dr koonce ended up giving him &# the plant is worth &# to &# things dont always work out so swimmingly for beyond the inevitable back sprains crushed fingers and carpal tunnel syndrome from chiseling rock mishaps do occur like the time dr koonce was transporting a tree on the freeway "i didnt lay it down and we hit an overpass that was pretty depressing " luckily the only casualty was the radiator of the car that followed behind which brings us back to the gophers after striking out at gopher station no dr koonce hits pay dirt "we may be in luck here " he cries out not to me but to tara and spanky his two australian cattle dogs after reaching the second station dr koonce digs his trowel into the soil revealing the trap with a gophers head sticking out "poor guy i really feel bad " he examines the body remember hes a doctor and notes that its a female "shes actually pregnant so she wont have her baby which means two points the best part the dogs just love these guys " and so the salivating canids have at the critter revealing much more than i care to see better to focus on the garden which proves much easier on the eyes and olfactory apparatus despite his attraction to grit grime and guts dr koonce does have a sensitive side why else would he grow orchids in a tree as a "little surprise" whats more each of the three times we walked through his garden didnt he hand me a flower to smell and dr koonce has a business side too hes already selling palms by word of mouth but he has also considered using his blue agaves to make tequila and even has two specimens of hoodia the weight loss wonder theres also the book project a how to on vertical landscaping "an off thought if i have time " all that however is secondary to the bigger picture of why he expends so much energy on his garden dr koonce likes to justify the work in terms of fire prevention succulents dont burn and erosion control terraces keep the hill from slipping during mudslides but theres something more significant going on standing at the top of one of his terraces one crystal clear morning he gives a hint "gardens are like having children you see how they grow and develop hopefully in or years these walls will all be up here and somebody will look at it and itll be amazing and theyll say i wonder who put this in " mr cooper is a writer in santa barbara calif
