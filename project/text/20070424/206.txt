help make things stand up in the vancouver sun cam cole focuses on mr luongos unlikely save "somehow the vancouver canucks goalie had come from nowhere to squeeze the shot between his arm and his body " he writes "barnes lowered his stick and cast his eyes heavenward and indeed that may have been where the answer lay not to disparage the work ethic of the canucks the leadership of winning goal scorer trevor linden the magic of luongo or the virtuosity of the sedin twins but deliverance on this night at general motors place came also from the hockey gods who moved the cross bar a hair lower

hockey then came game and the pressure to perform that accompanies it surprise surprise the stars fell apart now that the stars inability to deal with pressure is out in the open coach dave tippett and general manager doug armstrong need to deal with it call dr phil or oprah have the players lay on mats before the game and visualize performing under pressure just do something " the chicago cubs

empty bleacher seats announced crowd after predicting in spring training hed win the cy young award zambranos start has been no less dubious than his other prediction that day the cubs will um win the world series " the orlando magic fell short against the detroit pistons in game of their playoff series a pistons win that left orlando down in the orlando sentinel david whitley shakes his head over the magics missed chances and tries to get readers to take the long view "is it too soon for orlando to declare a moral victory and get out of the series " he asks "the magic dont want to hear that kind of stuff but lets be real when they left for michigan the best most thought they could hope for was to return with their heads still attached they not only are still attached they are shaking in frustration over what might have been fans dont like to hear talk about how this series is basically just a learning experience but thats the only way to look at it if they want to avoid complete depression nobody needs the tutelage more than dwight howard he is the future and the future obviously isnt now but the first two games will help it arrive " "college sports" typically refers to big football and basketball programs with their bright lights giant crowds and coaches under a lens but theres another kind of college sports as robert andrew powell writes about in the new york times

year college just outside fort lauderdale fla carlos go where we just told you every word mr starkman says is audible across the court its shockingly intimate like watching a command performance "

a world where too many of us use our mouths david used his mind in a world where fast and ignorant are celebrated david was slow and cerebral he was a throwback to how things should be covered and researched he once explained to an interviewer that he took notes long hand and if subjects spoke too quickly he asked them to slow down can you imagine that and after those handwritten notes he said he went home and spoke them into a tape recorder then had an assistant type them up in todays world of blogs and talk radio that must seem like carrying water from a well but it explains such books as the breaks of the game about professional basketball the amateurs about olympic rowing summer of about the yankees and the red sox or the teammates about four old ballplayers getting together in florida including one crotchety fellow named ted williams you can read these books today and they are as current and as complete as the year they were written " on deadspin will leitch writes that "halberstam wrote sports books as a whim and they were instantly better than everything else out there there wasnt a single time you read a halberstam book and couldnt tell it was his from his vivid prose but he never got in the way of his subjects halberstam actually ennobled his subjects by choosing them as worthy of profiling the fact that he decided to write about them in a way proved their public merit that friends is about as esteemed as you can get " tip of the fix cap to readers john falck and bryan hight found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to
