yeltsins russia boris yeltsins heart which gave out yesterday at age was in the right place at critical moments in russian history but his weaknesses not least for drink and bad company in the end failed him as well as his country he will be remembered for bringing down the soviet union and giving russians a taste of freedom but he also made possible vladimir putins destruction of russias fledgling democracy such contradictions were a reflection of his background no dissident intellectual in the vaclav havel mold mr yeltsin was a rough hewn construction engineer and communist party hack from sverdlovsk along the urals mikhail gorbachevs experiments with political opening in the s enabled his rise even in those days mr yeltsin mixed courage with foolhardiness naked ambition with a genuine popular touch history wont soon forget mr yeltsins finest hour standing atop a tank to defy a coup launched by party hardliners in august his instincts told him that the people wanted the soviet union buried something that mr gorbachev who believed lenins construct was salvageable never understood in a system as tightly wound as the u s s r only a charismatic and brave insider like mr yeltsin could have brought about its demise but the destructive skills necessary to do so proved inadequate to the job of building a state the new russia was led by the old guard in new clothes with mr yeltsin at the top to his great credit he embraced multi party democracy and put up with scathing dissent but mr yeltsin was his own worst enemy drunken escapades aside from ruining his health were symptomatic of poor leadership at the kremlin he briefly embraced limited market reforms in giving capitalism a bad name in russia he created the "oligarchs" through a "loans for shares" scheme in effect selling off choice assets to insiders for a song and a badly run privatization plan urged on him by advisers who gained most from it he failed to strengthen political institutions and the rule of law the chechen war that was begun in turned out to be a military and political debacle mr yeltsins tragedy was to stay too long urged on by his family advisers and foreigners who thought he was the only man standing in the way of a chimeric communist threat "i want this guy to win so bad it hurts " bill clinton said about the elections when mr yeltsin lay in a hospital after suffering a heart attack that was kept secret he did win but that year was the turning point for russian democracy by the yeltsin family was no longer willing to trust voters to select a replacement and found the obscure kgb colonel putin the businessman boris berezovsky a yeltsin confidant engineered the takeover to the younger man whose energy struck such a contrast with the incumbent the rest is russias recent history president putin has muzzled the press and free speech destroyed opposition parties and centralized economic and political power inside the kremlin in retirement mr yeltsin kept quiet as his good legacy was dismantled leaving mostly the bad russia was never as free as in the yeltsin s before or since
