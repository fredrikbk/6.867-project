spinning their wheels lack of sponsor interest plagues hedge fund bet on racings world cup dsc cdsbphilip richards dsc cdsb is the darling of the london hedge fund circuit in large part because of the stratospheric financial returns realized from high risk investments in nickel copper and other natural resource companies selling to asia but in december the rab capital plc chief executive strayed into another unpredictable investment auto racing the rab special situations fund paid &# million to purchase an stake in the agp racing series from one of its founding investors sheikh maktoum hasher maktoum al maktoum the year old scion of dubais royal family agp in which largely unknown young drivers compete under their nations flags in a series of international events seemed like an ideal platform from which multinational advertisers could put their products and logos in front of the developing worlds millions of budding consumers high profile global sponsors were all that were needed to turn the series into what rab envisioned as "the world cup of motorsport " an initial public offering of shares in a holdings ltd was slated for this month "you can grow businesses from small beginnings and i think this does have global appeal " mr richards says but the series has hit some serious speed bumps it hasnt signed an international sponsor the cost of holding its races is spiraling upward some events have been canceled or are in danger of not being run again and the ipo has been delayed "i dont know that rab fully understood what they were buying the hill that they have to climb or the competition in the marketplace for entertainment " says mark coughlin executive vice president of octagon racing group a norwalk conn sports marketing firm that negotiates auto racing sponsorships "simply put there is no value no one knows the drivers the cars are uninteresting and the xenophobic concept of my country racing against yours doesnt hold water because americas best drivers arent competing or the best drivers from other countries " without a single global advertising partner on board for the series it calls into question whether agp can establish itself as a viable open wheel racing series alongside those governed by the the federation internationale de lautomobile including formula one which is considered the sports highest level of drivers and techonology is lavishly sponsored and is avidly followed in hundreds of countries world wide in the u s where formula one has a modest fan base agp must contend with sponsorship juggernaut nascar which governs several immensely popular stock car racing series in north america agp which mr richards says currently makes up of the rab special situations fund lost &# million in the season according to pete da silva the former ceo of siemens south africa who was named agps chief executive in a february restructuring but mr richards the oxford university educated fund manager says it is too soon to judge agp a success or failure "never overestimate what you can achieve in one year " he says "and underestimate what you can achieve in five years we say it over and over again " rab has banked on the concept of fielding national teams including such countries as pakistan malyasia china brazil and india as a way to attract advertisers hungry to reach consumers in rapidly developing countries agp had hoped to sign coca cola co but coke declined both the u s and the china team approached computer maker lenovo group ltd but the computer maker said no and signed instead with formula one for "formula one is a great place to build the lenovo brand because it reinforces what our company stands for its highly international its based on the best engineering in the world and its completely driven by innovation and performance " says lenovo spokesman bob page adrian sussmann a vice president at css stellar management a sports management company that works on both nascar and fia events says "from what i can see it is going to be a struggle for agp to get sponsorship any business taking that kind of loss in you have to wonder how long they can do it for " but mr da silva notes agp is just months old and in only its second season compared with premier race organizations that have been around for decades he says he will put "disciplines" in place for next year that will put agp in the black and then improve its profitability in the fourth season "ive got my head on the block for season four " he says "weve got to achieve in our fourth year what formula one achieved in its first or years " besides series partners agp teams are having difficulty attracting sponsors to defray the &# million to &# million a year it costs them to operate rick weidinger the a team owner in the u s signed up berkshire hathaway inc s geico to sponsor the u s team last year but geico is no longer sponsoring the team according to kimberly aiello account manager for geico at its media agency horizon media the agp season started out well enough in october in the netherlands the dutch prime minister was among some people who attended but things began to get rocky in november in beijing the race there presented problems including crowd control issues and stretches that were too tight for cars to negotiate local press reports quoted the beijing organizers as saying they refused to lose another &# million and so were bowing out for next year liu yu owner of the a team china denies the event has been scrapped but it wasnt until february at the agp race in durban south africa that a race turned into a public relations migraine for agp it cost agp some &# million according to mr da silva attendance was strong but organizers enraged the citys merchants by closing off streets to traffic without much notice prompting the local papers to admonish organizers readers wrote in to call the race a "debacle " the head of south africas agp team quit after the durban race michael sutcliffe durbans city manager says local people were incensed by a sudden increase in the price of tickets in the weeks before the race went off the bad news continued rio de janeiro dropped out in march for want of a brazilian tv network to broadcast the race but south african diamond mining executive and natural resources investor tony teixeira who co founded what was then called a grand prix with sheikh maktoum and still retains an interest in the series says his investment in agp amounted to some &# million and was worth every penny despite the lack of corporate sponsors and money losing races mr teixeira says he has almost broken even by virtue of agps vip club the "pangaea club " vip tents are a common feature at motor sport events providing sponsors team owners organizers and other elite guests with five star amenities but agp gives the vip tent tradition an unusual and crucial twist it brings the usual vips literally under the same tent as high level government officials from around the world who are attending the race to see their national teams compete "the access to leaders in one room is huge to businessmen " mr teixeira says it has "nothing to do with motor racing they want to meet so and so from china and indonesia " rab capital declined to comment on the pangaea club meanwhile agp has engaged nomura securities to raise an institutionally targeted debt financing in anticipation of the future ipo and as part of a restructuring in february it has hired scott hollingsworth a marketing executive whom agp credits with turning around the financial picture for ama pro racing a motorcycle racing series to oversee franchise and event sales and marketing hugh chambers a consultant to the french and swiss agp teams which finished first and second in the season recalls that before the start of that season "there was huge enthusiasm in a management " now he says "theyve been beaten by reality " still he says they are in a start up phase today he says "people lick their lips when formula one impresario bernie ecclestone does another bond issue but it took years "
