politics &amp economics gates pursues russian support for u s missile defense plan moscow defense secretary robert gates sought to assure senior russian officials that the "days of the cold war are over" and to win their support for a u s missile defense system based in eastern europe the russians however werent quite so willing to let go of the past the disagreements over the potential missile shield which is similar to the costly and often erratic system the u s is building in alaska are part of a broader disagreement between the two nations over how the u s uses its military and economic muscle in the world earlier this year russian president vladimir putin lambasted the u s for adopting a foreign policy that is far too unilateral and reliant on the use of force after the speech which came as something of a shock to u s officials mr putin invited mr gates to visit moscow mr gates did just that seeking russian backing for a plan that would put ground based missile defense interceptors in poland and an advanced missile tracking radar in the czech republic the relatively small system would be designed primarily to protect u s allies and u s forces in europe from the potential threat posed by iranian ballistic missiles "we now face new threats that require new strategies " mr gates told reporters at a news conference here the russians by contrast have cast the largely defensive system as a potential threat to their country and the region "the russian position with respect to this issue remains unchanged " defense minister anatoly serdyukov told reporters after meeting with mr gates "we believe that the deployment of strategic missile defenses is a destabilizing factor that may have a great impact on global and regional security " u s officials didnt expect to win russian support for the missile defense deployment on this trip which is mr gatess first visit to the russian capital since instead the goal was to start a dialogue that the u s hopes will soften russian opposition to the missile defense program in recent weeks top u s officials have shuttled between washington and europe with a raft of proposals aimed at convincing the russians that a u s ballistic missile defense system in eastern europe wouldnt threaten russia militarily to woo kremlin officials mr gates offered the possibility of sharing sensor data from u s radar in the region as well as cooperating on research and development projects that could help russia bolster its own fledgling missile defense capability the u s has offered some cooperation on missile defense in the past but mr gates said the current offers on the table go "well beyond" past proposals by providing more concrete details and a broader scope of cooperation despite the russians public opposition to the missile defense system in europe mr gates said he is "cautiously optimistic" that u s and russian experts can make some "serious headway" on the issue in meetings scheduled over the next few months russia is opposed to the system in part because of a disagreement over the nature of the threat posed by ballistic missiles bush administration officials say it is possible if not likely that iran will develop ballistic missiles that can strike western europe the russians meanwhile have tended to play down the iranian threat doubting that tehran will have a ballistic missile capable of hitting targets in western europe in the foreseeable future the russians dont see the proposed system which could be easily overwhelmed by russias arsenal as a threat to russia right now but they are concerned that the u s could expand the system or that the technology could quickly improve u s officials said they also remain wary of u s intentions in eastern europe central asia and the caucasus where the two countries are increasingly competing for influence
