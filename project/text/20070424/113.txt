journal exchange the informed reader energy hydrogen may not be greenest route for carstechnology review april hydrogen fuel is widely seen as a potentially environmentally clean alternative to fossil fuels for use in cars but technology writer david talbot says the perception is wrong powering automobiles with hydrogen could actually be more polluting than gasoline the problem is says mr talbot scientists are several decades away from being able to manufacture hydrogen in a way that doesnt increase greenhouse gas emissions in a review of a book about climate change mr talbot chief correspondent for the massachusetts institute of technologys technology review considers the case of a bmw ag prototype vehicle the hydrogen sedan the car emits water vapor for exhaust instead of the carbon dioxide produced by gasoline powered vehicles that is thought to contribute to global warming one way to produce hydrogen is to extract it directly from fossil fuels another potentially more environmentally friendly approach is to use electricity to split water molecules this process requires energy that could come from renewable sources water wind sunlight and biofuels like corn but renewable energy accounts for just of the worlds electricity not including from hydropower with such scarce renewable energy resources hydrogen power might wind up being produced with coal which generates more carbon dioxide than any other energy source that would defeat the environmental inspiration behind vehicles like the hydrogen mr talbot concludes in a review of "hell and high water " a book by joseph romm an mit trained physicist a more efficient route for car makers would be to focus on high mileage gasoline powered vehicles they are simpler and less sexy than hydrogen cars mr talbot says but for now they stack up as the cleaner option
