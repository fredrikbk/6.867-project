health a special report health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q you mentioned that the problem with a lung cancer study was that it looked at survival rates rather than mortality rates im not sure i understand the difference e f a the issue of survival vs mortality is fundamental to determining whether screening for any health problem makes sense but its often a very confusing distinction most people think finding cancer early is always a good thing but that may not always be the case consider a patient who is diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of and dies at his survival after diagnosis was just two years now imagine we can go back in time and give him a ct scan that finds his cancer at if he dies at his survival is seven years that sounds good but he still died at the age he would have died if he hadnt been screened and he knew and worried about his cancer for five years longer so in this case screening didnt improve his life and likely made it worse but what if the same man got screened at and ended up living to the age of he might still die of lung cancer but early detection bought him five extra years of living by most standards five extra years is a good thing and he benefited from getting screened and so these are the questions at the heart of the screening debate does screening for cancer really prolong your life or does it just tell you sooner that you have cancer without changing whether you live or die from the disease most doctors agree that mammography screening for breast cancer and pap smears for cervical cancer clearly prolong a womans life but it isnt yet clear if other forms of screening such as psa testing for men with prostate cancer and ct screens for lung cancer are adding years to their life q are quick oats as good for you as the old fashioned kind you have to cook k s a old fashioned oats quick oats steel cut oats and instant oats are all whole grain products that means all three parts of the grain remain after milling so they all provide the same nutrients in the same amounts the difference is in cooking time and texture however instant oatmeal often has added sugar some nutrition researchers prefer thicker cut oats to the instant variety for another reason they have a lower glycemic index the glycemic index essentially is a way to distinguish between so called good carbs and bad carbs ranking carbs on a scale from to according to how much they raise blood sugar levels the good carbs or low gi foods are those that produce gradual rises in blood sugar and insulin levels low gi foods like many vegetables typically rank at or less while high gi foods like potatoes have rankings above according to www glycemicindex com a web site for checking gi rankings one minute oats have a gi index of compared with just for traditional oats in theory that means traditional oats should be more satisfying but it isnt clear if the average person would notice some research suggests that a higher protein breakfast thats low in saturated fat is an even better choice than oatmeal one study published in the march journal pediatrics gave overweight boys oatmeal or a vegetable omelet and fruit for breakfast and lunch later they ate whatever they wanted during the five hours after lunch the oatmeal boys ate more calories than the omelet eaters the theory is that the oatmeal wasnt as satisfying as the omelet and so the boys were hungrier the bottom line is that if oatmeal is a satisfying breakfast to you and you are eating sensibly during the rest of the day then its probably a good choice however nutritionists advise that if you are hungry two hours after any meal you are probably eating the wrong foods email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
