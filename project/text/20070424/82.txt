free speech gets another day in court most eagerly anticipated supreme court cases these days are the political equivalent of the hatfields and the mccoys with one side giving no quarter to the other a notable exception will be argued tomorrow federal election commission v wisconsin right to life even supporters of abortion rights are rooting for the wisconsin group to win at issue is a provision in the bipartisan campaign reform act bcra of which severely restricts "electioneering " or grass roots advocacy within days of a primary and days of a general election the supreme court unfortunately upheld the basic constitutionality of this provision four years ago in a case that bears my name but allowed for the possibility that specific applications of it could prove otherwise wisconsin right to life is testing that claim specifically the justices will consider a series of television ads the pro life group ran in the summer and fall of during a senate battle over a handful of president bushs judicial nominees the ads asked wisconsin residents to contact the states two democratic senators and urge them to allow an up or down vote on the presidents nominees because one of the senators russell feingold was seeking re election the ads were pulled but did the ads actually advocate for or against a candidate a three judge panel in the district of columbia said no thereby rejecting on constitutional grounds the application of bcra to the ads in question the bush administration appealed and the supreme court agreed to hear the case a ruling in favor of wisconsin right to life could deal a blow to one of bcras central provisions namely the "blackout" periods during which advocacy groups are forbidden from running issue ads that would be good but the larger question is why an advocacy group must defend itself for expressing its views on a question of urgent public interest this is precisely the question i and many others have been raising for more than a decade five years ago as my colleagues got ready to pass bcra i warned them that three things would result that rather than reduce the influence of money on politics theyd drive it further underground that advocacy groups would be blocked from speaking even on issues unrelated to elections and that a deadline on issue ads would only lead to campaigns starting earlier with a greater premium on early fund raising all three predictions have come true from the influence of s on the last presidential campaign to the case before the supreme court to primary campaigns months ahead of the next presidential election still bcras potential impact on the presidential primary season isnt what primarily motivated those of us who fought against bcra the issue then as now is more fundamental as i say in the amicus brief i submitted for tomorrows case "restricting grass roots lobbying would silence core political speech that is integral to the functioning of our form of government " the freedom to engage in this political speech is set out clearly in the first amendment and bcras strict limitation on issue advocacy of any kind during campaign season is a fundamental assault on its spirit and intent those who agree with me have reason to hope that the supreme court will overturn this restrictive provision one reason is that the court already acknowledged its potential harm in mcconnell v fec another is that the number of groups wrongly swept up by the blackout provision will only multiply as the primary season becomes longer the prospect of so many appeals would itself be a sign of the laws instability the irony in all of this of course lies in another prospect that groups as dissimilar as wisconsin right to life and planned parenthood of wisconsin might soon stand together to applaud the same ruling mr mcconnell r ky is the senate minority leader
