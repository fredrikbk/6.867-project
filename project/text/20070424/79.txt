for russians yeltsin leaves tarnished legacy putin invokes memory of post soviet unrest to roll back democracy moscow in the west boris yeltsin was a hero who leapt on a tank to defend russias fledgling democracy during an august putsch in russia the countrys first freely elected president who died of heart failure yesterday in moscow is blamed for an era of chaos and anarchy from which the country is only now recovering increasingly the era of mr yeltsins rule in the s is being recast by the man who became his handpicked successor in in the simplified script emerging from the kremlin president vladimir putin rescued the country and restored its shattered confidence following the lawless yeltsin era when russia was ruled by oligarchic billionaires did the bidding of foreign governments and was at the mercy of western oil majors "its all part of the putin myth that under yeltsin there was chaos and putin comes in and restores order " says georgy satarov one of mr yeltsins former aides in many ways this is standard treatment of kremlin leaders since world war ii with successors routinely burnishing their own images at the expense of the men they replaced since the death of joseph stalin soviet leaders have done this in order to justify their agendas and conduct housecleanings in government after coming to power in nikita khrushchev revealed many but not all of the crimes of the stalinist purges his successor leonid brezhnev chided mr khrushchev for dangerously un soviet behavior under mikhail gorbachev the era of mr brezhnev during the s and s became known as the period of stagnancy while mr gorbachev hailed in the west as a great reformer is blamed at home for russias diminished world stature "because there was no election process there was no legitimacy to the new leaders so they had to criticize their predecessors to give themselves legitimacy " said michael mcfaul professor of political science at stanford university "you see the same going on today " but in the process his critics say mr putin has dismantled many of the democratic institutions that were the main legacy of mr yeltsins years in office the official reaction to mr yeltsins death at age was respectful with state run television featuring warm words from world leaders such as british prime minister tony blair regional governors and other politicians "he was like a top class surgeon who was given a hopeless patient on the verge of death " nikolai svanidze an influential commentator on the rossiya channel said on the air "he performed a painful but necessary operation and the patient survived and continues to live " mr yeltsin earned widespread praise for navigating russia through the collapse of communism without major bloodshed and laying the foundation for democracy he instituted direct elections for parliament and regional governors nurtured and protected press freedoms and granted wide autonomy to russias provinces but his efforts to build capitalism on the ruins of soviet central planning impoverished tens of millions while enriching a handful triggering a wrenching financial crisis in critics say russian democracy never recovered from his decision to send tanks against parliamentary rebels in western governments initially had high hopes of a leader who seemed willing to align russia more closely with the u s and europe but grew frustrated with his increasingly erratic behavior on foreign trips he caused alarm by appearing ill or drunk similarly the kremlins assessment of the yeltsin years has grown increasingly critical while top kremlin officials have generally avoided any mention of mr yeltsin personally they have characterized his reign as a period of national humiliation and collapse mr putin has described the russia run by his predecessor as a country on the brink of disintegration with central rule crumbling regions breaking away from moscow and the nations wealth falling into the hands of a clique of corrupt businessmen mr putin recently described the collapse of the soviet union as "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the th century " mr putins deputy chief of staff vladislav surkov who has emerged as an ideologue advocating on behalf of the kremlins tightly controlled political system has said that institutions such as the press parliament and judiciary were mere tools of tycoons grabbing for the countrys prime assets the era of the soviet breakup in which millions of russians were plunged into poverty and their savings wiped out by hyperinflation took a toll on mr yeltsins popularity well before any rewriting of history mr yeltsins popularity was perennially low during much of his presidency and it wasnt revived much by his retirement a january opinion poll rated mr yeltsin as one of the countrys most distrusted politicians along with his predecessor mikhail gorbachev who is blamed widely for the soviet breakup in a televised address mr putin declared tomorrow a national day of mourning and credited mr yeltsin with creating a "new democratic russia a state that is free and open to the world a state in which the government really does belong to the people " he singled out mr yeltsins role in pushing through a new post communist constitution in that "declared human rights as the highest value " russias state controlled first channel also aired excerpts of mr yeltsins last tv interview in which he praised the present state of russia and said there was now "no turning back" from the democratic overhauls he had introduced in the s in private mr yeltsin appeared to have doubts about the direction in which the man he handpicked as his successor was taking the country mr yeltsin stood by in silence as mr putin reined in independent media locked up critical businessmen and hollowed out a once feisty parliament for a leader who had prided himself on defending free speech such moves were hard to take "of course he agreed with a lot of what putin did but there were other things he was unhappy about " said ivan rybkin a former speaker of the state duma or lower house of parliament mr satarov said he last saw mr yeltsin two years ago on his birthday at a party attended by several other former aides mr yeltsin said he was generally content in his retirement "we asked him if there was anything he was unhappy about and he replied yes the state of the country his expression was pretty glum " mr satarov said but mr yeltsin was reluctant to speak out against mr putin "he told me he thought it was unethical to criticize him publicly " said lyudmila telen a reporter with moscow news who was one of the last people to interview mr yeltsin "he said anything i want to tell putin i say to his face " he made an exception when mr putin responded to the beslan hostage taking tragedy by eliminating direct elections for regional governors in an interview with moscow news mr yeltsin warned against "suffocating freedoms and rolling back democratic rights " for many his death symbolizes the end of an era however faulty when the government attempted to establish democratic institutions that are now being dismantled by the kremlin in a system of government it calls "managed democracy " "boris yeltsin tolerated critics and opposition he wanted russia to be a friend of the world " says boris nemtsov a former deputy prime minister who knew mr yeltsin well "his successor has destroyed all of that there is no longer freedom of speech and instead of friendship with the world were surrounded by enemies "
