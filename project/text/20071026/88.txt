second opinion doctor roils colleagues in debate on fetal monitors barry schifrin testified against peers for decades a professional censure as a young doctor years ago barry schifrin worked with the yale medical team that pioneered the electronic fetal monitor the machine which tracks a fetuss heart rate during labor was developed to help reduce fetal death and brain damage but in an early experience dr schifrin says he saw trouble ahead he was a bystander as an obstetrics team interpreted a fetal monitors reading to be an impending crisis and rushed to deliver the baby by cesarean section dr schifrin took a look at the reading and thought the baby was fine but kept his opinion to himself the baby emerged healthy he recalls and the surgery had been unnecessary the incident he says showed him doctors could misinterpret data from this technology to the potential detriment of patients his crusade against that has put him squarely in the middle of a debate in academic halls over the usefulness of fetal monitors but it is his work as a paid expert witness testifying against other doctors that has antagonized his profession and solidified his reputation as a renegade dr schifrin years old has fallen out of favor with peers even so questions he has raised around fetal monitors remain contentious partly because they are often at the heart of malpractice cases his career arc is a window into the interplay of technology medical practice and the legal system when things go wrong obstetrics is one of the most sued medical specialties in the country and its doctors shoulder some of the highest malpractice insurance costs "fetal monitoring has become one of the tipping points in the evaluation of medical malpractice cases " dr schifrin says "its not the only factor " he calls his expert witness work "the greatest education of my adult life " dr schifrin has testified against other doctors hundreds of times in the past three decades in the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists censured dr schifrin for testimony he gave in a malpractice case he later resigned from the organization in "damages " a book that chronicles a connecticut familys odyssey in a medical malpractice case richard jones a former president of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists is quoted as calling dr schifrin someone "most of us view as a terrible waste a guy of enormous talent who could put it to better use " there were great hopes for the fetal monitor when it was introduced into widespread practice in the s fitted to the belly of a woman or placed directly on the fetus during labor and delivery the monitor tracks the rates of the mothers contractions and the fetuss heart readings create a line with small but unpredictable peaks and valleys when the babys heart rate drops the peaks and valleys are deeper and more varied before monitors became widely used doctors or nurses would use a stethoscope to periodically check for the babys heartbeat a procedure that was time consuming because it required care providers to take the babys heartbeats at regular intervals fetal monitors are now standard in virtually every u s hospital in of fetuses in the u s were assessed with the electronic fetal monitor the medical community agrees that the devices have almost eliminated stillbirths and can provide valuable information about a babys status during labor but there are limits to the technology fetal monitoring readings are subject to interpretation which can play a part in lawsuits some doctors say the monitor may cause unnecessary c sections according to data pooled from several studies that appeared in a bulletin issued by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists use of the fetal monitor compared with stethoscope monitoring increased the overall cesarean delivery rate by and c sections for suspected fetal distress by the monitor also contributed to increases in the use of vacuum and forceps during delivery the bulletin said vacuums and forceps are applied to a babys head when the baby wont come out the instruments may increase risk of injury to the baby during delivery the report concluded that the false positive rate of electronic fetal monitoring for predicting adverse outcomes is high "its done more harm than good " says todd rosen an obstetrician and assistant professor at columbia university college of physicians and surgeons "we monitor way too much " yet there are currently few alternatives to fetal monitors and doctors say the device is likely to remain part of most deliveries even doctors who say that the fetal monitor isnt perfect are concerned about the way that the readings known as "tracings " are often used against doctors in malpractice cases maurice druzin chief of the division of maternal fetal medicine at packard childrens hospital and vice chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at stanford school of medicine has been an expert witness in several cases on the opposite side of dr schifrin fetal monitoring "has been used in litigation to prove the point oftentimes inappropriately " says dr druzin "i spend a lot of time trying to defend doctors from inaccurate dishonest testimony " dr schifrin says he has always maintained that the fetal monitor itself isnt flawed the problem is how doctors and nurses put it to use being able to review monitor readings from so many birth injury cases he says has enabled him to understand where things go wrong dr schifrin grew up in new rochelle n y the son of a prominent obstetrician his father was a founding fellow of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists after attending chicago medical school he got a fellowship at yale to work with edward hon an early developer of the fetal monitor a father of three dr schifrin estimates he has delivered some babies in his career his favorite part of the job never changed "right after the babys born when youre standing with mom and dad and the baby getting your photo taken to me that was the happiest moment " he says "i never got tired of that " early on he was approached by a lawyer who had read one of his fetal monitoring articles the lawyer asked if he would be an expert witness in a "bad baby" case a term sometimes used in legal circles for birth injury cases dr schifrin says that at the time he knew nothing about medical malpractice or the role of expert witnesses he took his first case out of curiosity he says by word of mouth he was soon a sought after expert he says he likes examining complex medical situations detective style to see where things went wrong he also acknowledges that hes contentious and likes sparring with peers thirty years ago he set up a consulting company to review possible malpractice cases since then he estimates he has reviewed more than cases given depositions in to cases and testified in about trials he has earned approximately &# million for his expert witness work over the course of his career according to court transcripts he practiced medicine throughout and says his legal work wasnt "much more than of my time " depending on the number of hours a single case pays anywhere from a &# to &# dr schifrin says the most he ever made from a case was &# in maria spraitz gave birth to sarah who appeared healthy at over eight pounds but wasnt able to breathe on her own doctors determined sarah had severe brain damage caused by what they surmised was extensive blood clots and recommended she be taken off the respirator ms spraitz says as devout catholics the couple struggled with the idea sarah continued to decline and days after she was born was taken off a respirator and died ms spraitz and her husband edward were desperate to know what went wrong advised by a doctor to consult an attorney they were rejected by several lawyers who said theirs was a difficult case and that it would be costly to hire experts and there wasnt enough money in it for the lawyers because california has a &# damages cap on birth injury cases a doctor not involved with sarahs delivery reviewed the records and sent the couple to dr schifrin ms spraitz says ms spraitz called dr schifrin and recounted what happened "he was the only one who gave me a legitimate explanation for why my daughter never woke up " ms spraitz says dr schifrin says he has seen many cases where the monitor was detecting the mothers heart rate elevated by the stresses of labor rather than the babys he says that if the monitor had been reading the babys heart rate it would have showed an abnormally low heart rate suggesting oxygen deprivation monitoring with a stethoscope also might have shown this he says after dr schifrin reviewed the fetal monitor readings he agreed to testify in the case he put the parents in touch with the attorney who took the case according to ms spraitz the five physicians who testified on behalf of the case including dr schifrin did so pro bono dr schifrin says he received no payment for testifying or consulting in this case the couple brought suit against the hospital and the obstetrician the hospital settled but the obstetrician held out the case went to trial in los angeles in january on the stand dr schifrin showed the jurors the fetal monitor readings and gave his interpretation of them the jury deliberated for three days and without knowing there was a cap voted to award the couple nearly a million dollars they received the &# cap amount in a written statement issued through her attorney the obstetrician miriam mackovic basic called dr schifrins testimony "particularly untruthful " she says that the autopsy revealed that the infant had an extensive clotting disorder that predated the delivery "the infants injury and death had nothing to do with the delivery " she said in her statement "i dont believe that this was a failure of the fetal heart monitoring this was a failure of the legal system " dr mackovic basic who is still practicing said in a phone interview that she felt "terrorized" by the case of dr schifrin she says "i personally think hes a tragic figure hes brilliant and well spoken but he destroys peoples lives " dr schifrin stands by his testimony in that case "i have invariably kept my remarks to the facts surrounding the medical issues in the case " he says a decade ago the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists known as acog created a peer review grievance process which allows members to lodge complaints against peers including for alleged unethical expert witness testimony in acog created an "expert witness affirmation" a document that members can opt to sign saying they vow to give ethical testimony former acog president charles b hammond wrote that "expert witnesses play an important role in the civil justice system " but "too often however the college learns about expert witness testimony that is neither fair nor accurate " two months prior an obstetrician in utah filed a formal complaint against dr schifrin regarding his testimony in a malpractice case dr schifrin had prepared an expert report and gave deposition testimony in a case saying he believed the doctor violated the standard of care dr schifrin gave his opinions on the use of a vacuum to deliver the baby and the use of a size index that can be used to assess newborns the case settled in terms werent disclosed in acog censured dr schifrin the group declines to elaborate on why he received the reprimand in november of that year he resigned from the organization the acog censure was devastating dr schifrin says "understand that a censure isnt saying you made a mistake " he says "its saying you knowingly lied " he says he stands by his opinions dr schifrin says that the best thing doctors can do is admit fault when theyre at fault "look what anesthesia did " he says anesthesiologists were one of the most frequently sued medical specialists and carried some of the heftiest insurance premiums in the american society of anesthesiologists created a database to monitor and review every case brought against an anesthesiologist to understand where things might have gone wrong it also started a patient safety foundation charged with the sole purpose of researching and improving outcomes patient safety has improved and insurance premiums for anesthesiologists in adjusted for inflation were lower than in the group says dr schifrin says he gave up delivering babies in because he was "too old " he is now employed part time by kaiser permanente the california health network where he teaches and consults he also consults at hospitals reviewing cases with bad outcomes since the censure dr schifrin says his expert witness work has declined which he says he welcomes he says hes focusing on a new business venture developing a computer based training program for doctors and nurses that teaches them about fetal monitoring
