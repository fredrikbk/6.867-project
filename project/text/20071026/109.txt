uaw turns to hard pressed ford bargainers face a car maker in need of big labor cost savings with the united auto workers union on the verge of ratifying a new contract with chrysler llc bargaining now shifts to ford motor co the u s car maker with perhaps the greatest need for labor cost reductions ford posted a net loss of &# billion in and its sales are off in the first nine months of this year amid a broader downturn in the market driven by the housing slump and rising gasoline prices after a profit of &# million in the first half of much of that from one time items such as the sale of aston martin ford is likely to post a loss in the third quarter and a growing number of analysts are now questioning whether ford can achieve its goal of returning to profitability by for the auto maker the upshot of worsening sales is clear says john casesa a former merrill lynch &amp co auto analyst who now heads his own advisory firm "lose more money and expand the restructuring plan " if ford is forced back to the drawing board it would be the third iteration of a restructuring plan originally launched in january the second accelerated round of restructuring had a goal of cutting salaried jobs and to hourly positions by the end of now ford is evaluating its budgets and re examining its economic and cost cutting assumptions for the next couple of years people familiar with fords deliberations say the auto maker hasnt determined whether it will need to cut even more jobs but may come to that conclusion soon two ford managers say budgets could be squeezed by an additional to in some departments these executives say "the outlying next couple years look a bit worse than we expected when started " says one of the ford managers "the housing market and its growing impact on truck sales is a serious continuing concern " it is unclear how far the uaw would be willing to go to help ford weather the storm uaw president ron gettelfinger has said fords contract is likely to follow the pattern set by the agreements hammered out with gm and chrysler both got deals allowing them to shift billions of dollars in retiree health care obligations off their books to union run trusts known as voluntary employees beneficiary associations or vebas they also get two tier wage systems that enable the companies to hire new workers in certain "noncore" jobs such as materials handlers at a compensation package half that of most previous hires jerry sullivan president of uaw local at the ford f plant in dearborn mich says his members know ford is still in trouble and looking to cut more costs mr sullivans members are "ready to ok a contract like the one gm did or at least one close to the concept they had at gm " he says "the company is still pretty sick i think " he added the union is expected to begin final talks with ford soon ratification of the chrysler contract could come today after workers at an auto plant in belvidere ill vote on the deal it is the last big plant to cast ballots the chrysler contract faced stronger than expected opposition leaving ratification in question for several days but wednesday four plants outside detroit all voted strongly in favor of it a simple majority is all that is needed for ratification and the deal has been accepted by about of the chrysler workers who have voted because of its sluggish financial situation ford would like a new labor contract that expands the definition of what is a so called noncore uaw job which would get less in wages and benefits than existing union jobs a person familiar with the matter says this would enable ford to push more new hires into this lower compensated designation ford and the uaw are also discussing another potential round of thousands of additional buyouts to "take care of the extra people" from the six additional plants ford plans to close another person familiar with the matter says the two sides are revisiting the fate of six unidentified plants the auto maker intends to close as part of its turnaround plan this person said part of fords concern is that gm with an older work force and many more workers closer to retirement age has an agreement tailored to save gm more money more quickly than a similar deal would at ford said two people involved in the talks ford and the uaw also havent made much progress on talks about a veba these people say actuaries on both sides still disagree about health care inflation trend rates so the two sides still havent agreed what fords retiree health care liability is let alone how it will be funded "ford is staring at the pattern resisting it and trying to figure out a way to get more than gm got ford definitely doesnt want to make all the product commitments gm did " says one person involved in the talks gm promised to build several future vehicles in the u s as part of its new union deal while such promises will depend on market conditions the pledges gave gm workers the prospect of job security when considering ratification added labor concessions may be insufficient to pull the company into the black in the next two years many observers now predict auto makers could sell fewer than million cars and trucks in the u s in the lowest figure in a decade nissan motor co chief executive carlos ghosn said before the tokyo motor show that sales could bottom out at million million off a peak of million a few years ago that comes at a bad time for ford which needs revenue to offset negative cash flow through and pay debt a big sales downturn could force ford to unload volvo and perhaps a significant stake in ford motor credit its financing arm mr casesa says ford has posted steeper sales declines this year than competitors amid a deliberate drawdown in low margin sales to government and rental fleets and attempts to restrain discounting ford has years to go in achieving cost saving global synergies a linchpin of its turnaround effort under chief executive alan mulally most of fords similar vehicles such as the focus small car are built on different platforms in different global markets in addition ford has a relatively bare cupboard of new products between now and the focus marks one of fords few new entries mr mulally told reporters and ford employees during a recent gathering at the focuss assembly plant in wayne mich that the car will "define the ford motor co going forward " but the focus will need to gain a lot of traction in a bearish market to give ford real gains
