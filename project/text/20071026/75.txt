put out economic fires before the fed arrives the dallas feds harvey rosenblum "fed policy and moral hazard " editorial page oct hits the nail on the head when he gently chastises those who complain about the "moral hazard" the fed causes when it comes to the rescue of a stalling economy this is the notion that the fed has reduced our incentive to protect ourselves against bad decisions especially against bad investment decisions i would go somewhat further than mr rosenblum however and note that there is a fundamental difference between the public form of admittedly incomplete insurance the fed provides against sustained depressions and the again often incomplete fire insurance we purchase privately in the case of private fire insurance or property insurance we are rightly told to guard against the "moral hazard" of homeowners not being as diligent as they should be in reducing the risk of fire because they are insured against it when it comes to the fed and the business cycle matters are rather different unlike a private insurance company that can insure homes in a city against fire the fed has successfully demonstrated that it can reduce the number of jobs and the amount of economic output "burned up" in lengthy recessions the feds role is more rightly compared to the firefighter containing the blaze than an insurance company in the past fire engines were owned by insurance companies and any home not bearing the badge or sign of the insurance company might be left to burn we would certainly encourage greater private provision against bad times by withholding or hampering fed action but public action to extinguish fires wherever they originate has proved more effective john berdell associate professor depaul university chicago
