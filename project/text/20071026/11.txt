knows full well that the firm took pains carefully to investigate the facts and took remedial action " rbc said in a statement "he is choosing to distort facts and damage the firms reputation for his personal gain " yesterday the firm fired mr oconnor after inquiries from the journal amid the credit crunch theres been growing uncertainty in the financial world over what assets are really worth at

a total write down of &# billion at issue in the rbc matter by contrast are bonds whose values are relatively easy to determine as their prices are posted on trading screens traders could have incentive to inflate prices because their pay is based on the value of their securities positions rbc said in its statement that mr oconnors allegations are "meritless" and that the bonds in question by mr oconnor can be difficult to value when markets begin gyrating the firm said some bond products such as "callable agency bonds " go through prolonged periods when they arent actively traded other

from rbc the allegations surfaced in february when mr oconnor says he alerted ali jalai who oversaw the government agency trading desk that certain government bonds were mispriced then in a july email to jonathan hunter rbcs u s bond chief mr oconnor said "the treasury market was fairly volatile in late feb and i instinctively know this is trouble for certain government agency positions so i checked to see if things were ok what i found was the book was mismarked " in the july email mr oconnor says he called mr jalai on feb and said "i think you have a problem you need to see where bonds are being offered and see where bonds are marked out thats how you can see the problem " he says he told mr jalai mr jalai didnt return calls for comment mr oconnor was referring to the difference between the price at which at least one rbc trader was offering a bond for sale and the value at which the bond was being carried on rbcs books mr oconnor tracked a series of government agency bonds owned by rbc during the period and found that a number of bonds were being offered for sale at prices below where the traders had valued them on rbcs books for instance mr oconnor said one &# million position in federal home loan bank bonds due march was valued on one traders books nearly &# above where a trader offered the bonds for sale on feb even that price didnt attract buyers on march the same bond was valued at &# above where it was offered again failing to sell on july mr oconnor sent an email to mr hunter asserting that there was a "large disparity between where bonds are marked out in these agency callable books and current market levels " "let me be very clear about one thing " the email which was reviewed by the journal said "you would be extremely lucky to sell any of these bonds at the levels i have here " mr oconnor said in the message within hours rbc began to mark down the value of the bonds highlighted by mr oconnor leading to &# million in losses rbc took separate write downs on corporate bonds that had been improperly marked those write downs led to losses of &# million in the corporate bond division
