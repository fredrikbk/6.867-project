why vacuum cleaners are louder and other acoustic mysteries online edition vacuum cleaners are more annoying than ever they still dont do windows and the crescendo of their incessant whining can really rack the nerves which explains why parts of an upright vacuum cleaner are scattered around the floor of a small room under microphones suspended from strings the cleaner has been dismantled by the acoustical engineers of rh lyon corp in cambridge mass who are now carefully recording the sounds each component emits their goal is to discover how their client an unidentified manufacturer can modify the innards so customers will quit returning new cleaners complaining that theyre the next worst thing to fingernails scratching a blackboard rh lyon is a small research and consulting firm specializing in a relatively obscure branch of acoustics known as sound quality engineering its goal is to make things sound better whether they be vacuum cleaners copying machines or diesel engines better doesnt necessarily mean quieter "people expect certain products to sound a certain way and when they dont its a problem " says richard h lyon a year old massachusetts institute of technology professor of mechanical engineering who founded the firm in a buzzing or rattling sound can make a product sound flimsy sound quality engineers have found on the other hand a solid sound like that of a car door slamming can give the impression a product is well built once a maker of home whirlpool baths came to lyon complaining of soggy sales because the water pump sounded more like a vacuum cleaner than the soothing sounds that users expected the engineers designed a muffling mechanism that helped soften the pump sound a variety of unfamiliar product sounds also are afflicting consumers ears lying on one of lyons laboratory benches awaiting analysis for example is one of the new whirring string weed and grass trimmers the plastic string whipping through the air produces a mosquito like buzz that many people find disconcerting says richard cann a year old lyon acoustical engineer who has also tweaked the noises of color copiers and the lincoln continental today its the vacuum cleaner the companys costly attempt to quiet it with inserts of foam baffling hasnt worked noise has become a growing problem for vacuum cleaners in recent years says mr cann new tearproof paper and cloth bags are more resistant to air flow than the bags of a few years ago and thus require more powerful and noisier suction motors this in turn has compounded the "amps race " in which manufacturers are trying to top each other with claims of more powerful suction as measured by the amperage of the suction motor besides the sounds of the suction motor theres noise from the air rushing over the irregular surface of the motor explains david bowen the year old mechanical engineer working on the vacuum cleaner the use of plastic body casings creates new noise problems since the lightweight plastic vibrates more noisily than the older metal casings this means in turn that vibrations caused by irregular windings in the coils of the electric suction motor become more of a problem "the first step is to identify the main sources of noise " mr bowen says "we run each component individually and record it " many vacuums today have a cleaning head with a powered carpet beater in this case the lyon engineers already have found that vibrations from the carpet beater are causing pieces of the casing around the cleaners headlight to rub noisily against each other the recordings which include several characteristics of the sound such as its wattage and frequency are digital and can be fed into a computer the computer can mix the recordings of the various components and recreate the sound of the cleaner as a whole "we then create the sounds of a lot of hypothetical vacuum cleaners" with the computer each one showing how the cleaner would sound if a particular modification were made mr bowen explains the researchers can even duplicate the variations in sound that a user would hear as he pushes the vacuum to and fro over a carpet if the client desires the lyon engineers will then gather a panel of consumers and ask them to listen to the tapes on &# earphones as the jurors listen to the various hypothetical cleaners they are asked if one sounds as though it costs more than another cleans better or if it sounds like a better value once the lyon engineers pinpoint what modifications will produce the most appealing or least annoying sound the manufacturer has to decide whether the cost making the modification is worth it the vacuum cleaner project hasnt gotten this far yet dr lyon notes that two years ago general motors corp acoustical engineers described a study in which jurors were asked to rank the "solidness" of door closing sounds of various autos and then to rank the preferred sounds according to cost the aim was to get an idea of how much would be worthwhile for the auto maker to invest in designing a good solid sounding door closure it was sewing machines that plunged dr lyon into sound quality engineering at mit in the s he was analyzing the sounds of diesel engines and other machines as a means of studying or "diagnosing" what goes on inside the machines when singer co came knocking the sewing machine giant had discovered consumers seemed to like a competitors noise better than a singer machines noise "they wanted to find out what there was about the sound that people liked and how singer could modify its machines to sound more appealing " he explains a jury of consumers including who sewed was asked to listen to singer machines with modifications in various components as certain sounds increased such as the sound of a timing belt the jurys judgment of a machines quality declined confirming that consumers are influenced in their purchases by a machines sounds dr lyons success with sewing machines led him into other products which in turn allowed him to build a consulting business with four full time and four part time acoustical engineers some products however have noise problems that dr lyon admits cant be solved by sound quality engineering a new age devotee in seattle recently called him "she said she was having trouble with a low frequency sound coming from under her pyramid " he says
