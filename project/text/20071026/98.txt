move in merrill shares have fallen over the past five days and now trade at just times book value a low level by historical standards yesterday merrill shares were down &# at &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange and down from their week high on wednesday merrill startled wall street by boosting the size of its third quarter write down for mortgage related assets and buyout financing commitments to &# billion from its earlier estimate of &# billion on oct the news was a blow to merrill chief executive stan oneal and it sent tremors through other wall street stocks

portfolio of risky mortgage related assets had been valued fairly "were comfortable we marked these positions conservatively " mr oneal said on wednesday mr mayo said he believed mr oneal could survive in his job because the remaining seven eighths of merrills business including its league leading brokerage business are healthy if the firm faces another write down he said yesterday "his tenure would be a little more tenuous " mr oneal himself faced a packed auditorium filled with merrill employees for an hour late wednesday fielding questions from brokers and bankers and offering reassurance that no big job cuts are in the offing to a question about possible future management changes he said he didnt understand why people want to engage in such public speculation one broker from the washington d c area said his clients had been calling all day about the news with one wondering whether he should close his account one broker trainee asked what the news meant for trainees

pools of securities backed by mortgages as well as subprime mortgages extended to the least creditworthy borrowers criticizing merrill executives for avoiding some questions on a call with analysts mr hintz said "was merrill afraid that the rest of wall street would steal the firms secrets of hedging cdo exposure and controlling risk we dont think so " most analysts conceded that the rest of
