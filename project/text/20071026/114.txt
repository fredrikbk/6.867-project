weekend journal review theater small is beautiful passion chicago shakespeare theater navy pier chicago &# &# closes nov aristocrats strawdog theatre company n broadway ave chicago &# closes nov chicago intimacy is the most precious of theatrical commodities of course theres nothing like a really big show but theres also no substitute for the concentrated intensity of a small scale production seen in close quarters and when i have to choose ill almost always opt for the latter i had the good luck to catch two such shows in chicago last sunday and in both cases their quality owed much to the fact that i was sitting near enough to the stage to hear the actors breathing chicago shakespeares revival of stephen sondheims "passion" gains immeasurably from being performed not in the companys grand elizabethan style theater but in its upstairs house a black box performing space that has been set up for this production in a compact three quarter round seating arrangement taking his cue from the space gary griffin the chicago director best known to new york audiences for his work on "the color purple " has reconceived "passion" as a chamber piece accompanied by five instrumentalists with results as illuminating as were john doyles similarly scaled productions of "sweeney todd" and "company " part of what makes "passion" so well suited to such treatment is that it its scale is already modest though the emotions it portrays are unabashedly operatic one way to approach this sondheim james lapine collaboration is as a trope on a couplet by w h auden "if equal affection cannot be let the more loving one be me " here the unequal partner is the sickly unattractive fosca ana gasteyer who becomes obsessed with giorgio adam brazier a handsome soldier who is having an affair with clara kathy voytko a beautiful but unhappy bride who cannot live with giorgio save at the cost of losing her child foscas passion is so violent and all consuming that it threatens her life it also proves seductive to giorgio who has never known the disorienting sensation of being loved without limit "loving you is not a choice and not much reason to rejoice but it gives me purpose gives me voice to say to the world this is why i live " nothing in ms gasteyers oddly miscellaneous resume among other things she spent six years on "saturday night live" prepared me for her anguished performance as fosca a notoriously difficult role which she interprets as memorably as did donna murphy and patti lupone before her not only is her ashen hatchet faced fosca a heart shredding portrait of emotional deprivation but she also brings to mr sondheims score the nuanced and dramatically specific musicality one might expect to hear in a schubert song cycle her presence is so vivid that it would have thrown a lesser ensemble out of balance but mr griffin has put together a stageful of superior artists including kevin gudahl and michael nussbaum two of chicagos best actors who are more than able to hold their own while "passion" cuts too close to the knuckle ever to be popular i have no doubt that it is after "sweeney todd " mr sondheims greatest achievement a study of obsession reminiscent of proust at his most harrowing this tightly focused production does full justice to its jarring perspective on romantic love to see it in a seat theater isnt just a pleasure its an honor if you think chicago shakespeares upstairs theater is snug wait till you see the headquarters of strawdog theatre company an l shaped black box in a dingy storefront walk up yet that company which is celebrating its th season has a reputation that lured me to its production of "aristocrats " brian friels great play about a family of irish catholics who have sunk from upper middle class comfort into desperately shabby gentility rarely have my expectations been more satisfyingly surpassed strawdogs "aristocrats" is one of those revivals so excellent as to leave a critic with nothing much to do but order you to drop everything and go see it at once and its excellence like that of "passion " is deeply rooted in its clarifying smallness of scale i saw it from the front row of the theater sitting within arms length of a cast whose acting was so direct and unmannered that i felt as though i were dining with them mr friels love of chekhov has never been made more explicit than in "aristocrats " in which the smiling slavic melancholy of "the cherry orchard" is transplanted to a setting as irish as a fifth of jamesons not coincidentally a bottle of that well known whiskey figures prominently in this snapshot of a day in the life of the odonnells who are paralyzed by nostalgia for a glorious past that wasnt quite so glorious as they mostly like to pretend their plight is a metaphor for ireland itself a tribal land entangled in the choking vines of the increasingly distant but never forgotten past yet mr friel is careful never to overemphasize this larger meaning "aristocrats" can just as easily be interpreted as a purely domestic drama about a family whose distorted memories of "the life of the quality" stand in the way of their coming to grips with the harsh reality of their present day existence john henry roberts has the flashiest role as casimir the eccentric fabulist who treasures his implausibly vivid memories of famous visitors to ballybeg hall yeats chesterton cardinal newman whom he may or may not have actually met the most interesting part is that of eamon michael dailey a lower class boy who married an odonnell and now regards his in laws with an explosive mixture of love and bitterness "carriages balls receptions weddings christenings feasts deaths trips to rome musical evenings tennis thats the mythology i was nurtured on all my life day after day year after year a strange and marvellous education for a wee country boy wasnt it no not an education a permanent pigmentation " but every actor in the ensemble gives a complex fully rounded performance worthy of close study and rick snyders lovingly naturalistic staging and b emil bulous simple yet subtle set show them all off to perfect advantage ive seen plenty of first rate shows in chicago but to take in two revivals as good as these in a single day is more than worth the vexation of flying in and out of ohare airport as for those local playgoers who havent gotten around to seeing "aristocrats" or "passion " dont delay time is short mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to
