from balls of concrete to habitats for sea life designer reefs proliferate as a tool to counter the toll of pollutants overfishing isla mujeres mexico during a recent dive here todd barber hovered above such familiar tropical sights as red sea sponges iridescent fish and a half hidden moray eel but the coral reefs hollow spherical and made entirely from concrete were anything but typical mr barber wasnt surprised though a decade earlier he created the artificial reefs using concrete "reef balls " now those once bare and ugly spheres have been transformed into minireefs rich with life "theyre in pretty good shape " said mr barber after he climbed onto a boat and stripped off his scuba gear he was particularly pleased by the presence of a pederson shrimp a translucent creature with blue flecks making a reef ball its home mr barber is leading a charge to build "designer reefs" that will replace or support natural ones as the effects of overfishing pollutants and disease take a growing toll on these vital ecosystems his nonprofit reef ball foundation has so far cultivated about reefs in countries projects range from a mile long reef in malaysia to a half mile one at a millionaires island in the caribbean artificial reefs arent a new idea for years fisheries have made faux reefs by dumping junk old boats airplanes washing machines into the sea but such unscientific efforts can go haywire in about two million tires were dumped in the waters near ft lauderdale fla in an attempt to provide a habitat for fish the tires failed to attract marine life and instead littered the ocean floor they are now being removed the new "designer reefs" are much more sophisticated ecoreefs inc of jackson wyo sells ceramic structures shaped like branching corals essentially a prefabricated kit for making a customized reef a philippine company molds artificial coral whose shape texture color and even chemical signature are much like the real thing one quixotic scientist tries to spur coral growth by piping low voltage electricity through large metal mesh placed underwater but copying mother nature isnt easy an artificial reef may work in one location but flop elsewhere some coral fragments thrive only in shallower waters others must be oriented just so or they wont grow on the caribbean island of curacao a reef ball team made the mistake of planting corals upright instead of sideways and they fell off in a big storm in oman which isnt known for hurricanes a storm earlier this year wiped out some coral growth on reef balls reefs that develop naturally are created from colonies of tiny coral polyps when these animals die they leave behind a limestone "skeleton" on which other polyps grow slowly creating larger and larger structures these reefs range from the size of a small flower bed to the great barrier reef a coral edifice that stretches miles along the australian coast sea creatures depend on reefs for shelter and feeding and mating grounds for humans they are a rich source of fish and increasingly a destination for snorkeling diving and other recreational activities the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration estimates that coral reefs world wide provide as much as &# billion of services annually but reefs face increasing danger as traditional threats are compounded by the effects of global warming higher sea temperatures have weakened or killed a large number of coral reefs through a process known as bleaching warmer oceans may also be triggering more frequent intense hurricanes and a single such storm can trash parts of a year old reef in minutes in addition as more carbon dioxide is pumped into the air more gets dissolved in the oceans turning the water more acidic and hurting coral growth "about of the worlds reefs have been destroyed in my lifetime " says the year old mr barber if current conditions continue as many as of the worlds reefs could disappear within years according to noaa in mexico authorities from the national marine park off cancun are relying on mr barbers expertise to safeguard their reefs which have been damaged by boat groundings powerful hurricanes and a crush of tourists many snorkelers for example are nowadays dispatched to artificial reefs with terrestrial pedigrees instead of those that sprouted from sea beds "the natural reefs need to rest " says jaime gonzalez cano director of the cancun marine park who estimates snorkelers and divers visit the area every year molded from concrete a reef ball can be as small as a basketball or as large as a car an inflatable bladder placed in its hollow center allows the ball to float making it easy to transport and maneuver in the water fragments of living coral are glued to the surface of the ball which is then submerged if all goes well the coral grows and eventually attracts fish and other marine life mr barbers team and the mexican authorities have placed reef balls in three locations near cancun during a dive at one of the sites mr barber pointed out several reef balls that had been planted with coral fragments a month earlier the balls still had little growth looking more like huge abandoned wiffle balls than anything jacques cousteau might have happened on at the second location where balls were placed in large sea fans waved in the current and tropical fish darted through the reefs hollows but even artificial structures are vulnerable when hurricane dean hit mexico in august it tore a lot of soft growth including colorful sponges and barnacles from the reef balls the reef balls at the third site feet down werent planted with coral fragments instead in a decades time coral sponges and other organisms sprouted spontaneously on the concrete surfaces and attracted a multitude of fish when one of the divers brushed aside some sea grass to get a better photograph of a moray eel the frightened creature slithered from its cranny and lunged at him "it almost got my hand " said the diver who was equally startled mr barber got interested in restoring coral reefs in when a hurricane wiped out a cayman islands reef he first visited as a teenager sitting on the beach with his dad he wondered what would happen if a beach ball plastered with concrete was rolled onto the ocean floor would coral eventually sprout on its surface early experiments suggested it would so mr barber quit his lucrative job as a consultant at towers perrin and put &# of his savings toward making reef balls in mr barber turned his company into a nonprofit publicly audited foundation figuring that would lead governments some of his biggest clients to trust it more the group has coral experts and volunteers who install reef balls all over the world others have licensed the technology eternal reefs inc of decatur ga charges as much as &# to put a persons cremated remains into a reef ball it asks less for animal burials the reef ball foundation gets part of the revenue and has final say about where the balls will be placed mr barber says his foundation based in athens ga will oversee the installation of reef balls this year double the number in it costs an average of &# to make and install a single reef ball there are now in waters around the world the president of the united arab emirates has them fringing an island he owns says mr barber "were trying to keep up with global warming" and other factors that imperil reefs "youve got to be an optimist and keep plugging on "
