scientists using maps of genes for therapies are wary of profiling there is little of black and white in the human genome we are so new as a species about years that there is less genetic difference between any two of us than between any two members of almost any other mammalian species whatever our ethnic identity we share of our dna with each other yet in that other one percent researchers are finding so many individual differences they promise to transform the practice of medicine enabling treatments targeted to our own unique dna code viewed through the prism of our genes we each have a spectrum of variation in which a single molecular misstep can alter the risk of disease or the effectiveness of therapy last week the international hapmap consortium a group of research institutes and universities in six countries reported discovery of million places along the human genome where our genetic code fugues of agct varies by just a single letter from person to person tripling the known variations in just two years as researchers delve deeper into the biochemistry of human variation however we lack the vocabulary to talk about these distinctions clearly scientists and doctors struggle for ways to translate the nuances of genetic identity into racially defined medical treatments without reviving misconceptions about the significance for example of skin color the problem arises because it may be decades before anyone can afford their own genetic medical profile meanwhile doctors expect to rely on racial profiling as a diagnostic tool to identify those at genetic risk of chronic diseases or adverse reactions to prescription drugs researchers at brown university and the university of london and the editors of the journal plos medicine last month warned about inaccurate racial labels in clinical research in the absence of meaningful population categories researchers may single out an inherited racial linkage where none exists or overlook the medical effects of our environment what we eat where we live and how we treat each other "this is a debate over how medicine will be practiced in the st century " said gender biologist anne fausto sterling at brown university its not the first time that medical authorities have raised a red flag about racial labels in the american college of physicians urged its members to drop racial labels in patient case studies because "race has little or no utility in careful medical thinking " in the editors of the new england journal of medicine concluded that "race is biologically meaningless " and in the editors of nature genetics warned that "its bad medicine and its bad science " no one denies the social reality of race as reinforced by history or the role of heredity at its most extreme however the concept of race encompasses the idea that test scores athletic abilitity or character is rooted in the genetic chemistry of people who can be grouped by skin color thats simply wrong research shows indeed such outmoded beliefs led to the resignation thursday of nobel laureate james watson from the cold spring harbor laboratory in new york for disparaging comments he made about africans diseases commonly considered bounded by race such as sickle cell anemia are not some of the highest rates of sickle cell occur among indias pardhan and oktar peoples not africans its also common in sicily and greece yet clinical studies routinely analyze the data of personal variation in broad brush strokes without regard for the vast range of genetic variation that ancestry may encompass researchers studying physical appearance and genetic ancestry in brazil for example discovered that people with white skin owed almost a third of their genes on average to african ancestry while those with dark skin could trace almost half of their genes to europe they reported in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences "its clear that the categories we use dont work very well " said stanford university biomedical ethicist mildred cho government reporting requirements in the u s heighten the difficulty since clinical researchers must use groupings identified by the u s census that dont recognize the underlying complexities of individual variation migration and family ancestry in addition medical reports in the pubmed medline and the u s national library of medicine databases were cataloged until by discredited th century racial terms today there are no rigorous standardized scientific categories a recent study of genetics and heredity journals found that only two had guidelines for race and ethnic categories though half of them had published articles that used such labels to analyze findings eventually genomics may eliminate any medical need for the infectious shorthand of race "we need to find the underlying causes of disease " said david goldstein at duke universitys center for population genomics &amp pharmacogenetics "once we do nobody will care about race and ethnicity anymore " email me at sciencejournal wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to the science journal forum
