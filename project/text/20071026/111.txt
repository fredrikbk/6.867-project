weekend journal review film dan in real life puts set pieces before substance carell funny in spots jimmy carter film is moving but uncritical dan in real life" stars steve carell as dan burns a wistful widower and advice columnist for a local newspaper who keeps trying and failing to please his three young daughters hes a good father his youngest child tells him but a bad dad the movie doesnt lack for pleasing moments and charming throwaways in one of them dan slathers a slice of bread with peanut butter and adds some banana for a standard school lunch then with a private flourish he draws a happy face in honey on what will be the underside of the top slice its a double throwaway in fact a loving gesture that we barely notice and his daughter will never see still pleasing moments dont add up to a feature film even though this one strives desperately for substance and coherence by slathering its slender story with treacly family values most of the action takes place over a weekend during which dan takes his girls to a family reunion at his parents country home browsing the shelves of a nearby bookstore he meets marie a lovely sophisticate played by juliette binoche falls instantly in love and soon discovers that shes romantically involved with his brother mitch hes played awfully heartily by dane cook this part of the film is a dark comedy about sibling rivalry with jealousy and anger simmering beneath the surface then boiling over at a singularly unpleasant family dinner but the dinner turns out to be an aberration "dan in real life" doesnt want to be about dark feelings or for that matter real life only about goodness and brightness its main concern is dans quest for happiness which includes finding a new mother for his daughters so the movie keeps searching for uplift in a succession of set pieces that play like segments of a sitcom a family calisthenics session a homespun musicale another brief workout a round of charades within these little bits the likable cast does spirited improvs the most enjoyable is the brothers song about a notoriously homely girl from their days in high school she shows up as a gorgeous plastic surgeon played by emily blunt in the movies best comic turn outside the set pieces though the romance between dan and marie operates more often than not on the level of two talented actors talking to each other in front of a camera i defer to no one in my admiration for ms binoche but this time shes stuck with a contrivance instead of a role and she looks like she knows it as for mr carell he may not be everyman but hes a special man who thrives on special roles that involve vulnerability he found them in "the year old virgin" and "little miss sunshine " then came a cropper in the inexplicably awful "evan almighty " this latest film which peter hedges directed from a script he wrote with pierce gardner isnt awful though it gets to be terribly tedious especially when you compare it with mr hedgess previous film "pieces of april " a beautiful independent feature which marked his directorial debut four years ago the scale of that one was extremely small a running time of minutes a budget well below &# but the emotional texture was dense starting off as an eccentric comedy of alienation about a family with a pierced and bangled black sheep named april the film became quite disarmingly a drama of understated sorrow reconciliation and acceptance "dan in real life" is a family drama with a vengeance theres a sense of its writer director having been pulled every which way especially toward sitcom by the anxious making imperatives of a studio production and a star vehicle and it looks like a studio film flat overlit at times almost primitive "pieces of april" started with a funny scene in a tiny kitchen this one has everything but the kitchen sink when it comes to plot devices and time filling interludes i forgot to mention a sequence at a bowling alley whats missing is sustained feeling no sooner than youre stirred by something surprising or genuinely sweet youre shaken by another piece of shtick jimmy carter man from plains the smiling and unquenchably energetic hero of jonathan demmes documentary "jimmy carter man from plains" is a great advertisement for octogenarians and for the office of ex president to which he has brought a singular passion over the past quarter century one watches with wonder as mr carter slightly stooped but essentially undiminished by age soldiers on like a much younger man through a national book tour for his latest book the controversial "palestine peace not apartheid " challenged constantly on his use of an inflammatory term in the title he remains mostly calm and patiently didactic its grace under what he seems to feel is no pressure yet the documentary proves to be an uncomfortably admiring advertisement for its subject and a narrowly focused one at that notwithstanding a side trip to new orleans and occasional cutaways to news footage from israel and the embattled gaza strip the primary focus is the book tour and the terms of the film are clear unrestricted access in exchange for a mostly uncritical view of an extraordinary public figure although the film also cuts away every now and then to such critics of mr carters book as alan dershowitz uncritical but not unaffecting at a time when he could be resting on his laurels in georgia jimmy carter is out in the world as a peregrinating conscience dvd tip its hardly fair to compare a mainstream hollywood comedy to one of the most delicately european of american independent films but "the unbearable lightness of being" gave juliette binoche a role that was perfectly suited to her talents the czech country girl tereza whose life is transformed when soviet tanks invade her country philip kaufman directed from jean claude carrieres adaptation of the milan kundera novel because of an editing error the print version of last weeks column failed to identify susanne bier as the director of "things we lost in the fire "
