weekend journal the home front catalog critic coffee for a crowd in time for the holidays new plus sized percolators commercial grade noise its the seasonal coffee making challenge youve got a houseful of holiday guests to entertain and a coffee maker that brews only a dozen cups at a time you could make pot after pot in a frantic effort to keep the java flowing or you could just buy a coffee urn appliance manufacturers are increasingly emphasizing the latter hoping to convince consumers that a commercial sized coffee maker is worth having on hand even if its used only a few times a year earlier this fall saeco an italian based manufacturer known for its line of espresso and cappuccino machines introduced its renaissance coffee urn capable of making up to cups at a time hamilton beach based in washington n c has plans to introduce three new urns next year including one with a cup capacity coffee urns are essentially plus sized electric percolators the grounds are placed in an upper chamber and the hot water passes through continually via a tube most urns also have features to keep your coffee warm after brewing java snobs tend to spurn percolators saying that the constant contact between the heated water and the coffee grounds results in a bitter taste unfortunately you arent likely to find a french press that can do an urns job the five machines we purchased and tested at home all made a respectable cup of joe if the coffee comes out too weak or strong you can simply adjust the amount of grounds but we did find important distinctions among them the hamilton beach cup commercial coffee urn was noisy in a commercial sort of way at the same time its somewhat flimsy construction we couldnt help but note the wobbly spigot didnt suggest commercial grade durability another iffy model the farberware stainless steel cup coffee urn though it was among the classiest looking and most compactly designed of all our models it lacked some key features found on the other urns including an on off switch instead you pull out the plug to turn it off and an external glass gauge indicating how much coffee was made or remained and its cup capacity was the lowest of all our models the waring pro brushed stainless steel coffee urn came closer to our party friendly ideal this was the speediest of our models capable of turning out a maximum cups in minutes other urns took as long as a minute per cup another respectable machine especially given its lower price point mr coffees cup commercial stainless steel urn &# from officemax our pick for best value while
