internet bill wont open the door to new taxes your oct and oct editorials erroneously characterized our bipartisan legislation to extend a moratorium on taxing internet access as a "watered down version of ban that might open the door to new taxes " our bill would not open the door to new taxes on the contrary under our legislation consumers would continue to enjoy tax free monthly internet bills the internet tax moratorium has been the law of the land since and congress fully intends to extend the moratorium before it expires on nov the only question is whether we do it responsibly by passing a reasonable extension of the moratorium or whether we pass a permanent ban that wed most likely regret later our bill is simple first it would clarify the original intent of the moratorium by keeping monthly internet bills tax free as well as services such as email and instant messaging second our bill would protect the tax base of state and local governments so that schools hospitals and police are not shortchanged as more and more services such as phone and cable tv migrate to the internet its important to make sure that state and local governments are not deprived of revenues raised on services that have nothing to do with accessing the internet last and probably most important our bill provides a temporary but reasonable extension of the moratorium because we believe a permanent bill would be a mistake at this time just look at how much the internet has changed since the moratorium was first enacted in not more than years ago most subscribers had a dial up internet connection and couldnt imagine the high speed internet services available today if congress had decided to pass a permanent moratorium back then it would already be outdated and services like high speed internet would not be tax free instead congress wisely decided to enact a temporary moratorium when the law expired in and again in congress used those opportunities to update and improve the moratorium congress should apply the same wisdom and foresight this time around there is widespread support in congress for extending the moratorium for the time being we should set aside our differences over whether the moratorium should be permanent and pass an extension before the law expires on nov our bill which is good for consumers supported by state and local governments and acceptable to industry is the most reasonable and sensible way forward sen tom carper d del sen lamar alexander r tenn washington
