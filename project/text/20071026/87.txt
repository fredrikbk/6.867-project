the daily fix schilling boston relievers put rockies in an hole online edition game of the world series was a rout game was altogether different a taut thrilling little pitchers duel but the outcome was the same a win for the boston red sox one that left the colorado rockies in an series hole going into todays off day things looked better for colorado in the early going willy taveras led off the game by being hit by curt schilling made it to third after the boston pitcher failed to cover the base and came home on an rbi groundout by todd helton for a lead but that was all the offense the rockies could muster mr schilling departed in the sixth up but with runners on first and second then watched from the dugout as hideki okajima retired garrett atkins and brad hawpe mr okajima and jonathan papelbon then got the remaining nine outs with matt hollidays two out eighth inning single hit the lone blemish mr holliday was immediately picked off first in the washington post thomas boswell calls game "a contest of nerve a game that was as much exquisite excruciation as simple pleasure and in the end it needed old heroes men who knew the stakes because they grasp the game game the rockies hoped to win against josh beckett how much can you ask this game they had to win every play of this game was etched with an intensity appropriate to such stakes " in the boston herald steve buckley focuses on mr schilling a free agent to be who might have made his final start at fenway park "he is soon to be years old and he looks every day of it " mr buckley writes "he has an old timers contemplative stooped over walk as he makes his once every five days walk from the bullpen to the pitchers mound to begin each new assignment and he has a practiced crankiness from all those years of answering all those questions from the sporting press yet when it is october it is in schillings blood and we have famously seen some of that blood for him to pull some kind of lever from deep down inside and transform himself to someone as youthful and optimistic as jacoby ellsbury nobody can say for sure how schilling does it he just does " in the boston globe meanwhile jackie macmullan hails mr okajima a relative spring chicken at "the first japanese born pitcher to appear in the world series appeared unimpressed by his own historic moment last night " she writes "but then that has been the demeanor reliever hideki okajima has adopted since he made the decision to follow his more celebrated countryman daisuke matsuzaka to this strange and wonderful ballpark where everything seemingly has a nickname the wall the pole even the hot dogs okajima has not spent the better part of his career yearning to achieve validation in americas major leagues he did not arrive with dice ks resume or the burden of the weighty expectations that accompanied it he wasnt focused on garnering international baseball platitudes he wasnt bent on carrying the torch for his countrymen in fact he wasnt quite sure he wanted to pitch in the united states at all " in the denver post mark kiszla mourns that "the rock is gone from october magic at the world series the bats of the rockies have vanished without a trace for the first time in more than a month theres something new in the eyes of this colorado baseball team doubt " the best hope for the rockies is that theyll be revived by a shift in venue to coors field where the series resumes tomorrow night and thats not a crazy idea beyond the amusing thought of manny ramirez dealing with a gigantic left field the loss of the designated hitter will force boston to put david ortiz in the field not a good idea and either lose kevin youkiliss bat not a good idea or put him at third base not a good idea and lose mike lowells glove not a good idea in the kansas city star sam mellinger runs down the challenges awaiting the red sox in the rocky mountain news dave krieger issues a challenge to colorado manager clint hurdle shake up the underperforming lineup pronto "if your engine wont start you check the spark plugs " he writes "and the rockies spark plugs are dead yes willy taveras scored their only run in game but he and kaz matsui are for in the series with six strikeouts throw in ryan spilborghs batting ninth and a secondary leadoff man when the lineup turns over and their table setters are for " mr kriegers proposed solution "return kaz matsui to the leadoff spot only because somebody has to lead off move troy tulowitzki for with a walk in the series back up to the no hole and see if he can bring back the mojo that lineup produced down the stretch " as any baseball fan knows ernie banks never played in a world series but as the los angeles times thomas bonk writes he still dreams otherwise yesterday was a pretty good day to be a boston sports fan besides the red sox win boston college rallied from a deficit with to play to stun virginia tech the final blow on third and bcs matt ryan hit andre callender in the end zone from the hokies yard line with seconds left oh and bc was on the road and it was raining and there were starving lions loose on the field eating any player who let his guard down ok one of those things isnt true but in this college football season would you be surprised back to the boston herald and steve conroy who offers a great cinematic chronicle of the climactic play on third and the eagles called a play called rattler on which the outside receivers run posts and the inside receivers run corner routes " he writes "when nothing opened up callender snuck out of the backfield and into the right corner of the end zone ryan heaved the ball the width of the field and callender seemed to wait an eternity before it settled into his hands "forever " callender said of his wait "it was up in the air i lost it in the lights for a second then it came down and i got it just seemed like forever i thought someone was going to tip it because it came in slo mo but i came down with it " ryan raced to the sideline where he tackled his head coach and got rid of the excess emotion coursing through his body the fastest way he could he threw up in the richmond times dispatch bob lipper ponders what could have been "four minutes " he writes "thats all four minutes four minutes from another strike up the band thursday night howler in lane stadium four minutes from taking over pole position in its league four minutes from a slam bang shutout thatd vault virginia tech onto a short list of campusball entries who might play for all the marbles come january four minutes from collapse " must fans be born or can they be made dan shanoff took up that question on his blog yesterday using his own story by way of example while hes been a huge sports fan all his life until he was he lacked "that dominant gravitational life defining pull of a single team " mr shanoff found it in the florida gators the team his then girlfriend and now wife rooted for and that late conversion to being a "fan in law" has left him exploring the roots of fandom faced with charges that hes a bandwagoneer or worse mr shanoff answers with a proposition "i argue that making an active choice about my fandom even pushing in what some would describe as a mid fan life crisis wasnt just acceptable but arguably superior to the more traditional passive roots of sports allegiance " tip of the fix cap to readers don hartline and michael j mcconnell found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
