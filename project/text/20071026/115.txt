weekend journal sports by the numbers going to the middleman as the world series continues this weekend the starting pitchers for the colorado rockies and boston red sox will bask in the interview room spotlights before the games and the closers will get to relive their final outs or those they failed to get but a large part of the fate of both teams lies somewhere else in the hands of their middle relievers while starters are certainly pitching less that trend at least in the world series isnt as pronounced as you might think between and the average world series starter threw innings for world series starters since thats gone down to a much smaller drop than for starters during the regular season but heres the bigger difference when managers go to the bullpen these days they use more pitchers than they used to in the s each world series game saw an average of relievers since its been that means that a deep bullpen is even more pivotal now in world series games since the average era of winning middle relievers is for losing middle relievers that era rises to given that the average margin of victory during those years is just under two runs middle relief can be seen a hidden key to world series success when it comes to measuring the importance of a deep bullpen theres also a ripple effect at work that goes beyond the numbers red sox fans well know that if then manager grady little had had one more reliable middleman in game seven of the american league championship series he likely would have taken the ball from a tiring pedro martinez and may well have held on to his job another side effect of weak middle relief determined the outcome of the world series then yankee manager joe torre asked his closer mariano rivera for a series of two inning appearances throughout the postseason that strategy backfired in the most spectacular fashion in game seven against the arizona diamondbacks with mr rivera blowing a one run lead if the red sox have a hidden advantage its their deep middle relief corps boston has held opponents to a batting average in the seventh and eighth innings thanks largely to hideki okajima era manny delcarmen era and vets such as mike timlin era but the rockies middle relievers are better than you might expect holding opponents to a batting average although some credit has to go to manny corpas era who bolstered those stats before moving into a share of the closer role in the second half of the season with brian fuentes era who has been moved to a setup role for the playoffs jeremy affeldt era and matt herges era had been prior to the series a more than capable supporting cast to rockies manager clint hurdles dynamic duo and in this series the middle relievers should get plenty of opportunities because the hitters on both these teams have the patience to run up a starters pitch counts the red sox led the al with walks and saw more pitches per plate appearance than any other team in the majors and despite playing half of their games in coors field where pitchers are especially reluctant to give up walks the rockies played patient baseball ranking second in the nl with bases on balls and pitches per trip to the plate so as the red sox try to become the winningest team of the st century and the rockies try to continue their historic run remember that the outcome of this series may depend on which set of middlemen can best shut down a lineup of skilled patient opposing hitters
