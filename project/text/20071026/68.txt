oil tops &# on range of worries tensions in the mideast and tightening supplies push crude prices to record oil soared past &# a barrel to a record on a mix of unsettling news that ranged from middle east tensions to supply concerns demonstrating the delicate state of world petroleum markets heading into the energy intensive winter months the events which included a statement by a top opec official to the wall street journal that the worlds oil cartel doesnt see a need to check the price surge might not have moved oil markets dramatically by themselves but oils rise yesterday to an exchange high of &# a barrel shows that prices are responding to a slew of economic and geopolitical forces and suggests further big swings could lie ahead abdalla salem el badri secretary general of the organization of petroleum exporting countries told the journal yesterday the cartel isnt worried about prices hovering around &# a barrel as long as global economic conditions are good "we have no price band or price target " mr el badri said on the sidelines of a meeting with chinese energy officials in beijing "if it persists for a longer period then we start worrying but at this time we dont know whats going to happen next month " traders have speculated that the group could announce another production increase when it meets in december or even earlier at an opec heads of state summit in saudi arabia next month attention at those meetings will focus on saudi arabia which takes the lead role in the cartels decisions because it is the groups largest producer and the only member with major excess production capacity iran the worlds third largest oil exporter also figured in yesterdays price action analysts said the rise in futures prices stemmed from a blend of geopolitical unease including a new raft of sharp u s economic sanctions on iran markets were also digesting a midweek u s government report that pointed to declining crude oil supplies in the u s with particularly strong demand for scarce light sweet crude which is easier to refine into fuels like gasoline the market got its first nudge when reports broke that the bush administration planned to slap economic sanctions on two prime components of irans military as well as several of the countrys top state owned banks the steps marked a ratcheting up of pressure from washington and deepened fears that the bush administration may be set on a path toward outright conflict with iran over its nuclear program then came the comments from opecs mr el badri reported on wsj com yesterday suggesting that the cartel didnt plan to step up production to add supplies to the world market traders next reacted to a report from oil movements a british company that monitors oil tanker traffic in an effort to get around the secrecy of major oil exporters such as saudi arabia and kuwait the companys weekly report which went out in the morning said opec shipments for the first days of november appeared to be "well below the october equivalents " the report estimated that october opec shipments were likely to be about barrels a day more than their september level "but early indications for next month are that there may be nothing more to come " the world consumes more than million barrels of oil a day but a minor disruption can have an outsize effect because the margin between supply and demand has narrowed in recent years adding to the turmoil the turkish government announced that it reserved the right to invade northern iraq whenever it wanted despite strong u s and iraqi objections the turkish air force has been flying continuous bomber jet sorties near the iraqi border as tensions have risen over fighting between turkish troops and kurdish separatist guerillas in northern iraq turkey is a primary conduit for oil shipments from kirkuk iraqs main oil field in the north the oil movements report caused ripples in large part because it damped expectations that opec was going to boost oil shipments next month opec which produces about of the worlds oil last month pledged to pump an additional barrels a day as of nov in a largely futile effort to check the rise in oil prices so any hint that the promised increase may not actually happen was enough to spook an already tense petroleum market some opec members including saudi arabia fear higher prices will damp demand for cartel oil others such as iran would prefer to keep prices high mr el badri said that there is plenty of oil available and that prices have been rising on political turmoil in the middle east and investors dumping equities and putting their money in oil futures the rise in oil prices still hasnt stopped the resilient u s economy the average u s price for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at &# yesterday according to aaa despite oils rise that is up only one penny from the average price a month ago due to smooth u s refinery runs and strong imports but with winter on the way november heating oil futures yesterday went up cents to settle at &# a gallon an exchange record oil prices remain below their record when adjusted for inflation of &# a barrel reached in the spring of in the wake of the iranian revolution historically oil consumption rises during winter in the northern hemisphere because of its use as a heating fuel in many places but according to the international energy agency the paris based energy watchdog for western countries stocks fell million barrels or barrels a day between july and september that contrasts with an average third quarter increase in stocks of barrels a day during the past five years the agency in august said the amount of oil in tanks had fallen below the five year average to about days of consumption "were in an extremely tight supply situation " said ann louise hittle a wood mackenzie oil market analyst that she said was giving credence to "peak oil theory" and the idea that supply wont be able to meet growing demand oil analysts trace the current tightness in the market back to when chinas energy hungry economy pushed up oil demand by three million barrels a day opec increased its production that year by three million barrels a day to meet increased demand but that led to a collapse in the groups productive spare capacity its traditional lever for influencing world oil prices this year the situation has become worse opec placed constraints on its production starting last november driving up oil demand by million barrels a day in according to wood mackenzie developed economies responded by drawing down their crude inventories leading to more tightness in the market now the combination of record oil prices falling home prices and the growing subprime mortgage crisis have increased fears that the u s economy could possibly slip into recession worries of a downturn in the u s both the worlds largest economy and biggest energy consumer have only deepened the sense of caution among some opec members who must try to make the straddle between boosting supplies to tamp down prices while not sparking a precipitous fall in prices through oversupply opec ministers have complained in recent weeks that the latest price surge has little to do with fundamentals such as supply and demand they argue that the price increase is driven more by market speculation the falling u s dollar and refining bottlenecks guy
