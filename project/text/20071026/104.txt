weekend journal hours beijing vacations change when you go from being a couple to being a family with kids beach holidays arent such a problem because most five star resorts in the region have an army of "camp counselors" ready to entertain your kids while you snooze by the pool cities though are a different issue museums fine dining and shopping the typical things a grown up might indulge in arent high on most kids to do lists still many asian capitals can be family friendly weekend getaways we road tested five cities beijing kuala lumpur singapore taipei and tokyo with kids in mind the goal fill hours with activities aimed at young tourists beijing may not seem like much of a place to bring the family it is after all famous for being a huge sprawling city choked with traffic often carpeted in fog like pollution and home to some diabolically bad restrooms my wife and i have spent the past two years exploring this historic city with our three young children year old jacob eli and anna heres how to get a kids eye view of beijing and its surrounds day one  a m stay at the grand hyatt for its central location near the forbidden city and tiananmen square and for its magnificent indoor swimming pool properly called the oasis hit the hotels sprawling breakfast buffet before you head out for the day tip dont forget to urge your kids to go to the restroom any time a decent facility is available always carry hand sanitizer and wipes  arrange for a car and driver to pick you up and take you to the mutianyu section of the great wall you dont need a guide for this trip and your hotel will be able to help you organize transportation or any travel agent can do it two reliable alternatives are cycle china and chinese culture club dont go to badaling mutianyu is probably the second most commercialized section you have to pass through souvenir sellers and such at the bottom but it is far more beautiful and less developed be careful buying tickets buy one way passes on the cable car plus entry fees kids meters and under are free for everything and they dont tell you this and single tickets for the journey down by a luge like slide take the cable car up turn right on the wall and walk about an hour the trip down on the slide will be a blast for everyone even the most fainthearted friends ive taken up there have loved the descent the walk isnt too challenging but it does have some steep sections where you may have to carry children under years old if you have older children and want a longer stroll turn left on the wall the restored section ends in about minutes it is mostly a pleasant stroll but at the end theres a long and extremely steep set of steps that is unsuitable for most kids under  you have two different lunch options turn right into the second restaurant after the parking lot a local place with good basic food plus two fishponds where you can catch your own river sturgeon or trout the staff will turn them into a wonderfully barbecued dish as a bonus your kids will happily fish with nets or poles for as long as you feel like sipping beer or soft drink there are similar places further down the road that overlook a stream for a higher end western option visit the schoolhouse a lovely restaurant right on the road to mutianyu that also boasts a glass blowing studio  go back to the hotel and let the kids go for an oasis swim  take a minute cab ride to the beijing grand hotel go to the farthest entrance and walk to the second floor sichuan restaurant which features the best of both worlds five star hotel cleanliness and great authentic chinese food the kids will love the scallion pancakes and dumplings as well as the goldfish pond and the accommodating staff after dinner head upstairs to have a drink on the outside terrace overlooking the forbidden city  walk or hop a cab around the side of the beijing grand hotel until you get toward the back of the forbidden city there you should be able to get a pedicab negotiate a price before getting in pay no more than yuan about &# for each pedicab and cruise the perimeter of the forbidden city riding along the moat you will get a sense of the compounds massive size and can gawk at the elaborate corner structures bathed in floodlights parents with older kids may well want to visit this legendary home of emperors on your second day but its sprawling size and dense crowds make it a challenging visit for kids younger than  have the pedicab take you to donghuameng night market on wangfujing street directly behind the grand hyatt it is a bustling food market populated by vendors selling everything from deep fried scorpions and sparrows on a stick to lamb kebabs grasshoppers stinky tofu and strawberry kebabs day two  a m after breakfast head to the temple of heaven one of beijings most beautiful peaceful historic sites kids can ramble around the grounds watch people practicing tai chi play on the exercise equipment and listen to some traditional chinese musicians  if you are a glutton for punishment or just want to placate your kids cross the street to the hongqiao toy market a huge packed extremely loud place bargain hard if you have pre teen or teen girls go next door to the pearl market it is one of my least favorite places in town but jewelry lovers consider it a command performance  get a cab to go across town to ritan park for lunch at xiao wang fu if the weather is nice ask for a rooftop table try the peking duck twice fried string beans dumplings and whatever else catches your eye its all good  wander around the beautiful little park it has a climbing wall for older kids and a great "pleasure ground for children" featuring bouncy castles games rides and arts activities the kids can rent a remote controlled boat or a fishing pole to trawl for tiny goldfish the goldfish are intended to be taken home as pets but feel free to throw them back  take a cab to houhai lake and find a pedicab hutong tour while you may feel like a bit of a touristy dork its the easiest way with kids to get into beijings old twisty "hutong" alleyways which are must sees again bargain hard speak to a few different guys to get a feel for the going rate and make sure you are comfortable with your driver also be sure the tour takes you to the nearby drum tower where drums were once beaten to mark the hours of the day  have dinner at any of the places surrounding the lake a good option is the elegant yunnan restaurant south silk road on the west side of the lake ask for a window table and try yunnans famous puer tea if your kids arent too picky on the other side of the lake is han cang a more rustic option featuring excellent fish cooked in foil and salt baked shrimp on a stick  rent a boat for a ride around the lake you can choose to be piloted by a boatman in an old style long boat or rent your own puttering motorboat some decked out like faux donald ducks or rubber duckies  your hotel is only a short cab ride away get home and get those little monsters to bed treat yourself to a minibar tsingtao youve earned it alan paul is a beijing based writer chinese culture club web www chinesecultureclub org cycle china web www
