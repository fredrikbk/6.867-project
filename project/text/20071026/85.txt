study suggests cause and cure for ulcers online edition with hardly a note of fanfare medical researchers say they have discovered the cause and cure for one of humankinds most distressing diseases peptic ulcers but the discovery raises new questions for millions of ulcer patients and their doctors and poses a threat to profits of three of the worlds biggest drug makers a team of ulcer experts in houston report today on an experiment they believe convicts a bacterium as the culprit for the vast majority of the duodenal and gastric types of peptic ulcers more than one in americans will suffer such ulcers at some time thus no one is watching the advent of the ulcer cure more closely than the pharmaceutical industry glaxo holdings plc takes in an estimated &# billion a year from its ulcer drug zantac the biggest selling prescription drug ever marketed smithkline beecham plc hauls in about &# billion annually from tagamet while merck &amp co taps into this pharmaceutical gold mine for about &# million annually from its drug pepcid and eli lilly &amp cos similar drug axid posts sales of about &# million a year since these drugs called h antagonists heal ulcers but dont cure chronic ulcer conditions many people take them intermittently for weeks months or even a lifetime making them the most lucrative group of drugs ever sold the houston researchers say they used a two week regimen of quite different drugs to wipe out the suspect bacterium in the stomach or intestine of all but seven of ulcer patients in the following year no patient whose gut was cleared of the bacterium suffered a relapse of his ulcer the only relapses occurred in four patients who still carried the bacterium in their guts in a second group of patients who took only the ulcer healing drug zantac all remained infected with the bacterium and more than three quarters suffered relapses of ulcers within a few months these data along with similar experimental results elsewhere "provide compelling evidence that peptic ulcer is the end result of a bacterial infection " declare david y graham and his colleagues in todays issue of the annals of internal medicine dr graham a gastroenterologist is at the veterans affairs medical center in houston moreover "most ulcers associated with helicobacter pylori &# the bacteria&# are curable " they assert the exceptions they say are ulcers caused either by chronic use of anti inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen or by various disorders such as tumors that spur chronic overproduction of stomach acid patients most likely to benefit immediately from the discovery are those whose ulcers are so painful and recurrent that they and their doctors are considering surgery either to cut the nerves controlling stomach acid production or to remove the ulcerated part of the stomach or intestine "nobody should be going in for surgery until hes been treated for helicobacter " says gastroenterologist barry marshall at the university of virginia medical center in charlottesville the exceptions are patients who need emergency surgery to stanch bleeding the news may bring psychological relief as well as medical promise "most ulcer patients are told by their doctor that they are under stress that they are smoking too much and drinking too much " dr marshall says "when they get a relapse they think they are doing something wrong that they must be under stress" when in fact their real problem is a bacterial infection he says it was dr marshall an australian who first hypothesized a decade ago that the bacterium he and a colleague found in patients stomachs caused their ulcers not all ulcer specialists agree with drs graham and marshall the latest experiment like earlier ones has flaws that leave it short of rigorous scientific proof says gastroenterologist walter l peterson at the veterans affairs medical center in dallas "i still take the conservative approach" that the theory remains unproven he says but adds "i must agree that everyone seems to be coming up with the same results " others point out that the bacterial infection theory hasnt yet been subjected to a "double blind" clinical trial in which neither the doctor nor the patient knows whether the patient is receiving the new therapy or no therapy double blind experiments are designed to avoid bias by the scientist and to prevent the patient from feeling better just because he thinks he is receiving a powerful new therapy "we still have to dot the is and cross the ts " concedes dr graham but he says "its clear that if you dont have an infection and you dont take anti inflammatory drugs you dont get ulcers " the new "triple therapy " aimed to clear the bacterium from the gut consists of two antibiotics tetracycline and metronidazole plus of all things pepto bismol the pink colored antacid sold around the world by procter &amp gamble co bismuth containing antacids like pepto bismol suppress the activity of the ulcer causing bacteria healing drugs like zantac or tagamet also are used for as long as it takes to heal the ulcer the "triple therapy" isnt easy to take for two weeks the patient must gulp down one antibiotic three times a day the other antibiotic four times a day two tablets of pepto bismol four times a day and an ulcer healing drug once a day some patients may also suffer diarrhea or other adverse side effects of the antibiotics in an editorial accompanying the new report ulcer specialist john h walsh of the university of california los angeles recommends that doctors consider using the therapy in patients with helicobacter infections who have had two or more painful episodes of ulcers "less dramatic benefits would be expected in patients experiencing their first ulcer episode because one third of such patients never experience a recurrence " he says "many patients have a pain only once or twice a year and they can take an h antagonist and theyre fine " notes dr peterson in dallas such patients are likely to avoid the onerous triple therapy particularly since the ulcer healing drugs can be taken only once a day and have almost no side effects he says a smithkline spokeswoman says the new therapy wont have much impact on the market for h antagonists and arthur euler a physician and director of zantac clinical development for the u s unit of glaxo says "for the vast majority of patients the h antagonists are safe and efficacious and theyll stay with them " but perhaps not indefinitely "within a year or two youll be seeing more data on the risks and benefits" of helicobacter eradication predicts dr marshall over the next five years he says doctors will increasingly try to cure the infection particularly in patients who may need lifelong maintenance treatment with the h antagonists dr graham says "the key is to work out a better simpler therapy without the adverse effects " the big drug makers he adds "are starting the studies" to do just that but a once a day pill that could eradicate a helicobacter infection without side effects could of course wipe out a huge chunk of the market for the h antagonists "the single agent is a very attractive idea but finding it has been very frustrating " says glaxos dr euler nobody knows how a person gets infected by helicobacter the bacterium was unknown until when australian pathologist robin warren and dr marshall noticed it in some biopsies of stomach tissues "at the time it was gospel that bacteria couldnt live in the stomach because of all the acid " dr marshall says a few months ago dr grahams team in houston reported they had tested healthy houstonians for helicobacter and found were infected the incidence was higher for those in the low income brackets and higher among blacks than whites older persons are also more susceptible two thirds of a group of britons over age were found infected in one study left untreated the infection persists for a lifetime the bacterium settles on the lining of the stomach which suggests that it gets to the stomach via the mouth last year a team headed by one of dr grahams colleagues peter d klein of the u s department of agriculture in houston tested children in lima peru where helicobacter is widespread among infants to their surprise the infection rate didnt correlate with income level as in the u s instead the highest infection rate was among children who got water from the municipal system rather than from wells or cisterns this indicated that the bacterium could be spread by drinking water failure to find the bacterium in water supplies during some attempts indicated contamination occurred only occasionally last month british researchers reported they had asked adult britons about their living conditions when they were eight years old they found that the more crowded the childhood home the more likely the person was to be infected with helicobacter suggesting the bacterium is contagious the bigger mystery is why only some people with helicobacter infection develop peptic ulcers the researchers say whether some inborn vulnerability or some environmental factor triggers the ulcer isnt clear the houston researchers couldnt find any correlation between smoking and alcohol consumption and either helicobacter infection or ulcer recurrence psychic stress is so difficult to measure that medical scientists have never confirmed the popular notion that stress triggers ulcers the bacterium however may well explain medical mysteries beyond ulcers researchers say one is the mystery of chronic gastritis or inflammation of the stomach lining soon after he and dr warren isolated the helicobacter bacterium dr marshall lacking a suitable experimental animal took a dose of the germ himself a two week bout of gastritis ensued various studies have since nailed down helicobacter infection as a major cause of chronic gastritis
