challenge lurks life in a corporate fishbowl the british energy firm agreed to plead guilty to environmental crimes and agreed to a three year probation connected to a fatal accident in texas and an

standards and the requirements of the law for that we apologize " bp america chairman and president bob malone said in a statement he added "there is more to do and we are committed to doing it " the resolution removes a cloud of uncertainty over new bp chief executive officer tony hayward who took over an energy leader distracted by scandal and lawsuits bps american depositary shares rose less than to &# in p m in new york stock exchange composite trading the settlements call for extraordinary future supervision over the energy giant that is almost certain to curb its risk taking and could require it to go the extra mile on reforms and undergo extra expense to satisfy government officials monitors may for example require costly improvements to facilities prosecutors also said they dont rule out further action against company employees and indeed the probation period requires cooperation that could give them more information with which to pursue cases "nothing weve done today forecloses that " said peter keisler acting u s attorney general in the environmental matter while the guilty pleas wont impede bps ability to do business generally criminal law experts say bp could meet with obstacles bidding for federal business though it may negotiate with the environmental protection agency to avoid "debarment" from bidding on government contracts "if the past is any guide its likely that bp will be able to avoid suspension and debarment although not without significant costs " says david m uhlmann who until june was chief of the justice departments environmental crimes section and is currently a law professor at the university of michigan "theyll have to implement far reaching compliance measures " on the issue of debarments an epa spokesman said in an email "no decision has been made regarding bp the matter is still under consideration " the settlement isnt likely to completely diffuse political pressure rep john dingell the michigan democrat and chairman of

environmental integrity an environmental watchdog group said the settlements indicate the federal government is taking a harder line on environmental crimes "the enforcement program hasnt pulled any punches " said mr schaeffer who has been a critic of the bush administrations environmental record the daily surveillance by a compliance monitor over bps trading operations is unusual in the energy trading world and represents a heightened vigilance on the part of a more active cftc in the trading case "it means a whole new culture there most importantly it really says bp is prepared to fork over problem employees " said peter rodgers an attorney with sutherland asbill &amp brennan in washington and a frequent adviser to energy traders on transactions and regulatory matters "if i were sitting on the trading desk it would not be a very comfortable place " bp took pains to announce that the settlement "concludes all criminal investigations of bp america on matters related to propane gasoline crude oil and other commodity trading " although bp paid a fine to the new york mercantile exchange in over some oil trading activities no other regulatory charges have emerged against bp in connection with its powerful oil trading team the settlement wouldnt preclude a civil effort by the cftc but people familiar with the matter said it has been set aside for now bps trading operations have been hard hit during the probes once senior traders left or were suspended in the wake of investigations and others got offers elsewhere in a hot commodities job market although bp is building a trading facility in houston one of its key trading hubs and moving its oil traders to chicago some believe it could face obstacles recruiting the traders charged were mark david radley james warren
