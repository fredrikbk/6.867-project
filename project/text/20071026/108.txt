weekend journal hollywood report oops can we sell her again as album debuts britney is absent a shoot cut short britney spearss every move is documented by paparazzi and celebrity blogs but there is one area where she is keeping a low profile promotional efforts for her fifth album "blackout " set for release tuesday thats remarkable given the make or break moment that appears to be at hand for the year old singer her career represents one of the biggest ascents and biggest flameouts of the past decade after exploding into the cultural consciousness in with " baby one more time " the former tv mouseketeer blazed a hit making trail that defined the teen pop era of the late s and early s ms spears seemed positioned to become her generations madonna a tireless professional with an ear for timely pop hooks and a flair for reinvention instead the wheels came off and she started careening down a slide that had more in common with michael jacksons carnival ride lifestyle than madonnas focused careerism not long after the singer released her fourth album in late ms spearss music career all but ground to a halt as she became a full blown tabloid fixture highlights included two failed marriages a stint in rehab and a bizarre episode earlier this year in which she commandeered a razor at a suburban los angeles hair salon and sheared off her blond hair with photographers capturing it all through the window for months ms spears has led l a s paparazzi around like a pied piper her movements tracked in minute detail from starbucks to taco bell to child custody hearings now comes "blackout " her chance to move the spotlight back onto her singing and away from cringe inducing parenting mishaps and run ins with photographers yet apart from last months mtv video music awards at which the pop star performed an infamously sloppy rendition of the albums first single "gimme more " ms spears has had little to do with the kinds of efforts traditionally staged by a music label to kick off a major release nonetheless ms spearss label sony bmgs jive records is betting that the album is strong enough to release now even with its star largely unavailable sony bmg paid her a hefty cash advance of nearly &# million for the album according to a person familiar with the situation ms spears is spending much of her time in a custody fight with ex husband kevin federline over their two young sons he has been temporarily granted sole custody of the boys as a result of that and other competing priorities the singer hasnt committed to appearances on television or radio interviews with print media or other typical promotional opportunities she cut short a shoot for the video for "gimme more " and she has recently parted ways with her manager her music business and divorce lawyers and her publicist leaving her effectively without direct representation or guidance for several months ms spears was even estranged from her mother lynne who had long been a key adviser according to people around ms spears her mother is now back in the picture even so executives at jive records are confident about the commercial potential of "blackout " the company is shipping to one million copies of the cd to retailers before its on sale date according to people close to the label by standard industry reckoning that would imply they expect first week sales of roughly to copies in a market that has seen album sales plummet from a year ago that would be a strong showing though still less than sony bmg executives are apparently forecasting for some other artists on their roster carrie underwoods latest cd shipped around million copies before its release this week while alicia keyss new album planned for next month is expected to ship more than one million copies some early signs for "blackout" are promising "gimme more" has remained in the top songs on apples itunes stores for more than six weeks helping it reach a peak position of no on the billboard hot singles chart her highest position on that chart since her very first single the no " baby one more time " but "gimme more" quickly lost momentum in radio airplay a key driver for album sales sliding to no last week on the chart before inching up to no after shooting some footage for the "gimme more" video ms spears backed out of the rest of the taping resulting in a video that relies on some shots of a dancer whose face cant be seen teresa labarbera whites senior vice president for a&amp r at jives corporate parent zomba label group says that when it comes to promoting the album ms spears will be involved in "certain key things " but declined to elaborate she says the singer has been reviewing concepts for a followup video to "gimme more " ms labarbera whites declines to name the followup single involved "i dont think of her as out of pocket because i talk to her two or three times a day " the executive says ms labarbera whites adds that during the months it took to record the album in los angeles new york and atlanta ms spearss professionalism "never wavered " the label set up nurseries for her sons at the various recording studios "shed work take a break and play with the babies " then get back to work the executive says recently some magazines have found themselves waiting for ms spears before a los angeles judges ruling that temporarily removed the children from ms spearss custody the editors of us weekly and people magazines received calls from young women who identified themselves as assistants to the singer and offered to bring ms spears and her sons to the magazines offices for photo shoots the singer never turned up us weekly editor in chief janice min says the call "was from ms spearss assistant at the time and not surprisingly the call was returned" but ultimately no shoot was arranged a spokeswoman for people says "we just cant talk about our story subjects " whether ms spears cooperates with traditional promotions for "blackout" may end up a nonissue when a music label sets up interviews and televised performances the goal is to gain visibility for the singer ahead of the cds release when it comes to typical promotional gambits such as appearances on late night talk shows there is little jive could do to boost ms spearss profile significantly higher than it already is "whats she going to do " asks a person close to the label "play kimmel "
