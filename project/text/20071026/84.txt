squeezing iran yesterdays announcement by the bush administration that it is sanctioning irans islamic revolutionary guard corps is a step forward even if it is belated having threatened "serious consequences" for years without imposing any such thing on tehran president bush has finally done something other than jawbone the u s is hitting the elite revolutionary guards the heart of the governments defense force for proliferating missiles bank melli and two other state owned banks are named for financing the countrys nuclear and missile industries the u s is also citing the branch of the revolutionary guard known as the quds force for supporting such terrorist groups as the taliban hezbollah and hamas these sanctions should have some bite because weve learned from north korea that even unilateral u s financial sanctions can get the attention of rogue regimes foreign banks and businesses dont want to lose their ability to operate in the u s which they run the risk of doing if they violate the sanctions by doing business with these iranian groups and individuals the revolutionary guard corps has evolved from a paramilitary force into a giant military and industrial operation it has an estimated fighters and acquires builds and proliferates a variety of weaponry its business operations have made it increasingly important as a financing operation for the government cutting it off from legitimate global finance will make it harder to operate abroad and will send a message to average iranians that the group is viewed as an international pariah naturally even this is too provocative for some people including vladimir putin and most of the democratic presidential candidates fresh from his own friendship tour of tehran the russian president yesterday compared the decision to "running around like a madman with a razor blade in his hand " this is the man mr bush invited to kennebunkport this summer in a show of personal support connecticut senator chris dodd added that "i am deeply concerned that once again the president is opting for military action as a first resort " first resort these nonmilitary u s sanctions come after more than four years of deferring to european and u n diplomacy toward iran the u s delayed even this move for months as it tried to persuade russia not to block more serious sanctions through the u n security council iran feels confident in pursuing a nuclear bomb and promoting terrorism precisely because it believes mr putin and others will block any serious multilateral response as for mr dodd and democrats the question is why they object to even these efforts to show iran that it cant kill americans with impunity u s commanders in iraq have provided acres of evidence that the quds force is responsible for aiding shiite radicals with deadly roadside bombs senior administration officials tell us that of u s casualties in iraq are the result of shiite forces supplied by iran the quds force has been caught red handed supplying the taliban with weapons that kill u s and nato troops in afghanistan yet most democrats seem more offended with mr bushs decision to impose financial sanctions against such an enemy the main problem with these sanctions is they probably wont go far enough to change iranian behavior the mullahs have become persuaded that the bush administration is too tied down in iraq and that europe is too afraid to do anything more serious if the rest of the world really wants a nonmilitary solution to iranian aggression they should see these u s sanctions as one last chance to show tehran otherwise the alternative is likely to be the resort to military force that democrats claim to want to avoid see related letter "letters to the editor proud resilient iranians resist u s warmongering" wsj nov
