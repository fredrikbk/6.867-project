weekend journal review books the high price of glamour the star machine by jeanine basinger knopf pages &# in the three decades from the birth of talking pictures to the end of the eisenhower age hollywood filled movie screens with pictures a year they were crammed with stars from fred astaire to loretta young with bogart bacall cagney cooper crawford davis flynn gable garbo grable grant hepburn ladd loy muni powell power robinson stanwyck stewart tracy wayne and dozens more in between it all seems so innocent and beguiling in these hollywood days of brad and angelina and tom the scientologist but it wasnt the alchemy that turned constance ockelman into veronica lake and joe yule jr into mickey rooney is the subject of jeanine basingers "the star machine " an industrial size history of the hollywood star system that has more going on in it than a busby berkeley number in an old mgm musical chatty and factoid ridden the book retells the familiar story of star manufacture as if it were an original idea true movie fans will recognize most of this material and probably wont care much about the rest "the illusion of stardom is always the illusion of ease " writes ms basinger but behind the ease was a ruthlessly efficient process that identified assessed remade and promoted potential stars then typecast them in strings of familiar roles until they exhausted their appeal rebelled or ran away "i wasnt a sex symbol i was a sex zombie " recalled veronica lake the girl with the peek a boo wave who became a star because she was tiny enough to make her frequent co star the foot inch alan ladd look like a leading man mammoth studios like mgm and th century fox commanded phalanxes of make up artists plastic surgeons dentists and coaches for speech singing dancing fencing and posture to overhaul promising candidates then there were top of the line costume designers to dress them lighting wizards and ace cinematographers to film them and flacks to plant stories about them in modern screen and even life magazine the primpers and crimpers spared no one the exquisite maureen ohara barely escaped a nose job but the broadway dancer eleanor powell was zapped with ultraviolet rays to eliminate her freckles and had her pores shrunk for close ups rita hayworth who started in charlie chan movies as rita cansino was turned into a redhead and had her hairline raised by electrolysis so shed look less latin lana turners eyebrows were shaved off in so she could play an asian in "the adventures of marco polo" and they never grew back the resulting beauties were unlike anything ever seen before or since "if you want to see the girl next door go next door " said lucille le sueur a freckled redhead from san antonio who emerged from the machine as the sleek joan crawford essentially the same routine produced male stars as diverse as mickey rooney and tyrone power who actually came from an old stage family but the problem as louis b mayer and other tyrannical moguls discovered was that their obedient millionaire chattels were human creatures who sometimes refused to follow the script a few like deanna durbin the busty operatic soprano who burst into glorious song in two dozen smash hits for universal in the s simply walked away moving to a farm outside paris where for all anyone knows she still lives happily ever after tyrone power sulked his way through money making costume dramas and pirate extravanganzas until darryl zanuck relented in and let him play a circus geek the sideshow freak who eats light bulbs and bites the heads off chickens in "nightmare alley " powers fans hated it and he never had a challenging role again until "witness for the prosecution" in the year before he died from a heart attack at age and then there were stars who really stepped wide of their marks lana turner the sexy drama queen of mgm took up with a handsome hoodlum named johnny stompanato one spring night in stompanato menaced turner in her hollywood mansion until lanas year old daughter cheryl crane rescued her by stabbing him to death or so the story was told errol flynn the dashing star of "captain blood" and "the adventures of robin hood " caroused himself to death at at the last in the downy arms of a year old named beverly aadland more than a little star struck herself ms basinger who heads the film studies program at wesleyan university neglects to mention the widespread whispers that cheryl crane took the fall for lana who actually wielded the knife and the author crops out the nymphet aadland from flynns sad demise turners notoriety and flynns peccadilloes the early ones at least actually enhanced their star power their studio masters shrewdly incorporated their scandalized behavior into the personae they portrayed on screen just as the lines were blurred between other stars and the characters they played henry fonda once declined to play henry fonda in a film explaining "i dont know that character " or as cary grant once said "everybody wants to be cary grant even i want to be cary grant " as "the star machine" chugs along ms basinger includes so many exceptions to her general rule about the studios manufacturing and control of stars that her worn thesis begins to disintegrate charles boyer a success in france and germany came to hollywood and became an even bigger star without the ministrations of the studio wizards the great lover was married to the same woman for years and committed suicide the day after she died doris day achieved stardom but the equally accomplished rosemary clooney never made it the young van johnson made a splash with esther williams in "thrill of a romance" in but a boy wonder contemporary of johnsons sonny tufts became a punch line it was the audience that spotted buck toothed goofy mickey rooney as andy hardy in a low budget quickie called "a family affair" in and as ms basinger writes "mgm had a bonus star on their hands " for an academic ms basinger has not only a shaky grasp of usage but also a zest for cliches worthy of "entertainment tonight " "all systems are go" in movies "helmed" by directors "who have their work cut out for them" but without "letting the cat out of the bag" deliver a picture "to die for " in the end of course its all about talent and grace and charisma and after fraught pages of text ms basinger finally admits "what is unequivocally true about the creation of movie stars then and now is this its a mysterious process " now she tells us mr kosners memoir of his career as editor of newsweek new york esquire and the new york daily news "its news to me " was published last year
