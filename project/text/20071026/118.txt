weekend journal tastings a great finishing touch muscat canelli will win your guests over to dessert wine sometime in the next couple of months you are going to have a big dinner with friends and family that you simply dont want to have end isnt it great when that happens youve been eating for hours and youve already had some lovely wines but theres plenty more laughing and talking in all of you what should you do about the wine at this point many people go for port or other significant dessert wines or maybe even cognac we prefer something lighter simpler and less alcoholic we reach for muscat specifically an american wine called muscat canelli were suckers for muscat with its unique aromas and tastes of honeysuckle apricots peaches and just picked grapes the only problem is that the name "muscat" takes in a lot of territory and we mean that literally because its grown pretty much all over the world and comes in all sorts of styles the first sweet wine we fell in love with many years ago was muscat de beaumes de venise from the rhone valley of france dry muscat from alsace is a wonder and there are few wines more charming than slightly sparkling moscato dasti from italy these days after a big meal we prefer a kind of wine sorbet many muscats including our old favorite beaumes de venise are fortified leaving them not only sweet but high in alcohol at least or so how can you identify a muscat that is lower in alcohol and lighter in taste heres one tip look for muscat canelli muscat is an ancient grape and there are several main varieties the finest variety is muscat blanc a petits grains which is the one usually called muscat canelli in the u s for years our favorite lighter muscat wine has been moscato dandrea from robert pecota winery in california which is made from muscat canelli we wondered if there were many other muscat canellis out there and how they were overall we checked stores nationwide and ultimately chose a large sample these tend to be made in very small quantities so in this case we went particularly deep to get a good sample we ordered texas wines from a large store in texas for instance bought some made in missouri found a good selection from californias temecula valley at shoptemeculawines com and got some from wineries in some other states from a web site called appellationamerica com with an internet connection a little time and a bit of creativity most people now can order all sorts of interesting wines online and this is one example because sweet wines arent very popular these tend to be reasonably priced indeed we didnt pay more than &# for any of them the pecota was the most expensive ounce for ounce because it cost &# for a half bottle almost all of them were identified as muscat canelli on the front label though in a few cases we had to look at the back label ask a wine merchant or check a winerys site on the internet the alcohol content ranged from to but most were around or having tasted the wines in blind flights over several nights we feel quite comfortable with this advice find a muscat canelli thats alcohol or less chill open for your guests and you will have a wonderful time the wines on the whole were a delight they were filled with honeysuckle and orange blossoms with all sorts of fruits from apples to pineapples some actually reminded us of pineapple upside down cake and really who doesnt smile at the thought of pineapple upside down cake while the wines were sweet and we know that many people dont think they like sweet wines the good ones were balanced with lemony acidity that made the wines light on their feet as well as light in texture dottie summed it up nicely at the end of one flight when she said simply "these are gentle wines " of course they were not all winners some were too sweet and heavy without the necessary balancing acidity these wines should ooze charm not sugar and unfortunately theres not much room for error in these wines because they are best when they are light and airy even just a little too much of anything can make them unbalanced and clumsy but overall the wines were lovely and perfect for after dinner conversation generally the wines in our sample from california were best with more of the essential balance of light and sweet our favorite once again was the pecota which always makes us feel like were in the middle of a field of flowers "this makes me think of easter " said dottie recalling grandma dots brown sugar basted ham set in a halo of peaches and oranges its a happy wine thats best served with cookies and close friends readers often ask us how long to age various wines our response is that truth be told you can never tell for sure and we were reminded of that during this tasting we would most certainly recommend that you buy and drink muscat canelli as young as possible good ones taste like a souffle light and ephemeral and you wouldnt want to eat an old souffle but in the course of this tasting we decided to open a pecota muscat that had been sitting in the cellar for no good reason and it was pretty darn spectacular rich and dark with ripe roasted mangoes oranges and carambolas sprinkled with cinnamon nutmeg and coconut yep coconut it was amazingly light despite its richness it probably will take some effort to find a muscat canelli many stores wont have any and its unlikely youll find a big selection anywhere but theyre out there we bought ours from six states so our advice is that sometime soon long before your next big dinner party call around and see if you can find one then after dinner dont ask your friends if they want to try a sweet wine theyll likely say no just open and pour the wine will do the rest melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones muscat canelli index in a broad blind tasting of light sweet american wines made from the flowery muscat canelli grape these were our favorites we like to sip these after dinner while there are quite a few muscat canellis out there almost all of them are made in very limited quantities so its impossible to know which ones you might see some wine stores might not carry any at all so you should call around in a few cases such as pecota and maddalena there is a newer release of the wine that we didnt see given a choice wed buy the younger one all of these are called
