weekend journal taste bayou bobby alas for me i didnt get to cast a vote for bobby jindal the winner of last weekends louisiana governors race its been years since i left the bayou the last time i voted in a gubernatorial contest there it felt less like a civic duty than an occasion of sin i pulled the lever for democrat edwin w edwards instead of my fellow republican david duke following the instruction of the bumper sticker on my car "vote for the crook its important " that evening i went to a party in baton rouge attached myself to a keg of budweiser and talked long into the night about how four years after electing the supposedly reform minded governor buddy roemer it had come to this i was only two years out of lsu and like just about everybody i knew then wanted to move away what future did any of us have in a state where the choice was either a blow dried ku klucker or an oleaginous cajun kleptocrat as the joke had it the wizard or the lizard i soon left for washington d c a new job and a new life many years later in an online discussion about the fate of the state i read that a well known new orleans journalist having lost hope in his familys future there stood in the middle of his newsroom to announce his resignation he said that he loved the city dearly but couldnt raise his children in a town that cherished parades more than libraries framed that way you can understand why so many louisianians choose to expatriate but never quite get over leaving louisiana has been at or near the bottom of "quality of life" lists for so long that you start to believe that theres something genetically wrong with its residents for out of the past years louisiana has been either americas least livable state or runner up in the annual morgan quitno research firms comprehensive rankings which combine educational economic health environmental and crime statistics no wonder louisiana has for at least two decades experienced a steady out migration of young professionals you notice something though when louisianians meet in exile everybody misses home and will take any opportunity to talk about it our friends yankees mostly get the biggest kick out of our honest to god tales of bayou state life political and otherwise my wife a native texan confessed that when we first started dating she thought my stories about my homeland revealed me to be a pathological liar until i took her there to see for herself she visited my uncle murphys grave and saw the headstone hed won playing bourre a cajun card game with an undertaker he had it inscribed with the epitaph "this aint bad once you get used to it " louisiana makes a lot more sense if you read the beloved picaresque "a confederacy of dunces" as an exercise in literary naturalism theres simply no place like louisiana you will not find more generous and life loving people anywhere and lord knows you wont eat or drink better its hard to get over that but you do mostly last sunday i ran into a couple i know at a krispy kreme shop here in dallas we got to talking about the jindal victory and the wife a non native who had fallen in love with louisiana as a tulane student said warmly that shed love to move back the husband gave her a look that telegraphed "yes we all would dear but come on " despite all the sentimental longing for lsu tigers tailgating and the scent of zatarains crawfish boil on your fingers moving home rarely crosses the minds of us expatriates louisiana is a great place to be from but the sense of fatalism that pervades life there casts doubt on whether it will some day be great place to be in louisiana to be educated is to love the state and hate the state and for many to leave it heres the thing about bobby jindal he didnt leave for good he came home with his ivy league and oxbridge education and his startling smarts he could have gone anywhere and nobody back home would have blamed him in fact he is the epitome of the kind of louisianian who emigrates to dallas atlanta and points beyond driving around with an lsu sticker on his bumper but he didnt the guy actually seemed to think he could make a difference in louisiana he got involved in government at age and stuck with it he ran for governor in and lost to democrat kathleen blanco when the katrina hurricane aftermath destroyed ms blancos career mr jindals loss came to look like a blessing in disguise anyway after what katrina revealed about the chronic dysfunction of the state how crazy would a politician have to be to think he could straighten out a place like that well now we know this unlikeliest of all deep south politicians a squeaky clean gen x son of indian immigrants a policy wonk and catholic convert who as a child adopted a nickname from a "brady bunch" character just got himself elected in his victory speech mr jindal exhorted a jubilant crowd of supporters "im asking you to once again believe in louisiana " thats asking a lot as it happened the night mr jindal won i was having dinner in henry county ky with the farmer and agrarian poet wendell berry and a group of his conservative admirers earlier in the day wed heard mr berry talk about how we americans educate our children today for outgoing not homecoming and what a shame that is wed been talking about what kind of country wed have if folks decided to stay home and learn to love their little place that night my father woke me up phoning from st francisville la "jindal won tonight " he said tickled to death so did the tigers but i dont think he even mentioned football i havent lived in louisiana in a long time but this election makes me proud and hopeful two emotions unfamiliar to exiled bayou staters and the promise of mr jindals leadership makes me wonder for the first time since i packed up the u haul and drove off if maybe i and now my children have a future in louisiana yes i know reform minded governors and their supporters always come to grief in our wizardy lizardy banana republic yes im fully aware that louisiana is bound to break your heart and yes i live happily in texas but you know what my governor is a hindu catholic republican and i think hes going to write the next great louisiana story maybe just this once its not going to be a farce mr dreher is a columnist for the dallas morning news see related letter "letters to the editor i wont trade good food and love for opportunity" wsj oct
