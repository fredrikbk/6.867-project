weekend journal taste de gustibus real men smoke pandas beijing to all the other superlatives used to describe china add the fact that it has the tastiest cigarettes i dont pretend to be a connoisseur having only smoked for a couple weeks but then again ive been tasting chinese cigarettes for years everywhere you go here men are smoking despite a proliferation of signs forbidding it given the high levels of second hand smoke even if you think you dont smoke actually you do despite appearances the government claims that not every chinese man smokes unbelievably one in three does not nevertheless the country consumes about one third of the worlds cigarettes they are a staple of everyday life as a student i often carried a pack just to offer to other people want to start a conversation on a train shake the pack asking directions hold out a stick and say chou yi ger if the guy is already smoking hell tuck it behind his ear for later after years of resisting a friend in shanghai gave me the perfect excuse to stop having to explain that no i really dont smoke he pointed out that china has become so polluted at least when youre smoking you get to breathe through a filter if your lungs are going to get shot to hell anyway you might as well enjoy it and now well into middle age i figure its probably a good time to start now i enjoy it so much i dont know why i didnt start earlier for chinese the habit carries very different connotations than in the west real men smoke period and when real men are hanging out together they smoke a lot womens presence is appreciated if they are quick with a lighter sometimes each course of a banquet is followed by a cigarette like a sorbet to cleanse the palate with a few more at the end instead of port as the saying goes fan hou yi zhi yan sai guo huo shenxian a cigarette after a meal and you feel better than a living god mao zedong and deng xiaoping smoked like chimneys even when they were photographed meeting foreign dignitaries the government provided top leaders with top quality tobacco presumably to help them stay healthy these brands many of them made in shanghai on the equipment confiscated from the capitalists acquired an aura of power limited production now helps them retain their cachet mao reportedly favored zhonghua which means china they come in a distinctive red packet the color of the forbidden city walls embossed with the gate of heavenly peace in gold although without maos portrait perhaps looking at his own face on his cigarettes would have been too weird deng smoked the elusive pandas which have a campy s look with their psychedelic orange packaging and cartoon of pandas snacking on bamboo i quickly found that puffing on the same lights as dead dictators doesnt come cheap zhonghua runs you almost &# per pack and pandas if you can find them are approximately &# mid ranking cadres got the lesser panda in a blue box which are about &# riding on these brands coattails are a few wannabe luxury smokes for instance huanghelou made in wuhan retails at &# a pack but one senses that it is trying too hard with its gold foil around the filter as well as the sense of history that surrounds zhonghua and panda one has to acknowledge that they taste fantastic both are exceptionally smooth almost like an indonesian kretek but they kick like a camel unfiltered open a pack of zhonghua inhale deeply and there is a distinct bouquet of preserved plums even when theyre alight i think i can still discern this fruity note but mostly the carcinogens glide gently down your airway if this is the road to an early death it is an extremely pleasurable one should you ever be in the unfortunate position of being offered a last cigarette make it a zhonghua this is a cigarette to be savored like a vintage wine pandas by contrast are made with a darker tobacco and hence more woody and nutty with hints of pine shavings and hickory they are a bit stronger and have a very long filter to compensate but they leave a spicy aftertaste which perhaps is why deng who was from sichuan the land of chilies and peppercorns loved them so much the elusive panda is a great conversation starter too as i roamed around beijing the last few days offering a zhonghua was sometimes appreciated but pandas always elicited a comment it may not be politically correct to say so but i dont look forward to the day when china cracks down on smoking like the rest of the world the smells of the old china are disappearing like the smoke of the feng wo mei charcoal powder pressed into the shape of a honeycomb which was once burned in most households for cooking and heat whenever an old man exhales off his cheap cigarette it transports me back to "hard seat" train compartments where i was almost asphyxiated by the clouds of smoke long may there be at least a few chinese who appreciate the pleasures of maos favorite cigarettes mr restall is the editor of the far eastern economic review
