politics &amp economics weak spending may hurt china beijing while china delivered another quarter of double digit economic growth its persistent weakness in consumption is likely to limit how much support the nation can provide to the global economy as the u s slows data announced yesterday show china is still growing extremely rapidly with year to year expansion of in the third quarter although the pace has eased but consumer spending is accounting for a smaller share of chinese economic growth this year than last while dependence on exports has increased stronger consumption would help address trade imbalances and increase the chance of chinas playing a bigger role in helping sustain the worlds economic expansion growth was down modestly from the second quarters rate and inflation although still high at was down slightly from its recent peak those results were enough for government officials to credit their recent policies including raising lending costs at banks and lowering tax benefits for exporters with averting overheating analysts now forecast a gradual easing in the pace of chinas expansion with growth in gross domestic product likely to slip below in still extraordinarily fast by global standards especially for a country that will soon edge out germany as the worlds third largest economy behind japan and the u s whether chinas rapid growth can be maintained has become increasingly important as the possibility of a recession in the u s has risen "previously when the u s would falter we would see that global growth would evaporate it seems that theres a little more of a chance of growth being sustained right now " says david cohen of action economics in singapore "the u s is somewhat less important than it was a half dozen years ago because of the dramatic growth of asia " the acceleration in chinas economy in the past few years has had two main drivers a boom in housing infrastructure and factory construction and a dramatic surge in exports there has been a slight moderation in both but rapid growth continues investment spending has expanded by so far this year compared with at the same point of and chinas trade surplus grew in the third quarter down from in the second quarter mostly because of tax changes for exporters and a high base of comparison last year both of those sources of growth hold risks companies and local governments are investing in many projects that could turn out to be unnecessary in a few years time creating a drag on the economy and while consumers in the u s europe and japan are snapping up chinese made goods a drop in consumer spending in rich countries could hit hard that has prompted many calls both inside and outside china for a shift in the countrys growth model "bold structural policies are needed to shift chinas growth away from heavy industry high energy use and dependence on exports " treasury secretary henry paulson said in a speech tuesday chinas government says it is moving in that direction "increasing the contribution of consumption to economic growth has been an important focus of our economic policies in the last few years " li xiaochao spokesman for the national bureau of statistics told reporters yesterday as he announced the latest figures he said wage increases and welfare programs are putting more money in chinese consumers pockets mr li said preliminary estimates show consumer spending has accounted for of chinas economic growth so far this year yet thats down from for all of according to figures previously published by his bureau and chinas dependence on exports and investment has increased the relatively large role of exports and smaller role of consumer spending is one reason why chinas growth hasnt become more of a driver elsewhere chinas construction boom has benefited the worlds producers of raw materials and heavy equipment but its consumers dont buy many other goods from overseas
