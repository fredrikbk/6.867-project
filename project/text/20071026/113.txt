weekend journal review television womens work its hard to say whether "womens murder club" would be so watchable without the anchor of its main star angie harmon fridays p m et on abc as is this light drama about a group of four women closing cases while they discuss men and marriage fills a niche that has been emptying out since the demise of "murder she wrote " which is to say that it has enough going on to keep viewers occupied but nothing that will jar them out of the comfort zone if that sounds like a recipe for ratings disaster in a tv era of panting bedmates severed limbs and guantanamo plotlines it may well turn out that way if abc doesnt promote the show well it should though because the networks apparent hunch when it picked up "womens murder club" that there is an audience out there dispirited by much of todays sexy edgy fare and desperately searching for an old time pleasant experience is probably correct back to ms harmon whom many will remember as the junior prosecutor on "law and order " she is what men used to refer to as a good looking gal but is threatening to neither sex and convincingly conveys inner fire she has more or less the same persona on "murder club " only now she is a droll san francisco homicide detective while shes tough as nails on the job she also has a personal life complicated by a boss whos her ex husband rob estes and a reluctance to look for love again helping her crack cases is an assistant d a with commitment issues laura harris a medical examiner paula newsome with a wheelchair bound husband and a perky crime reporter aubrey dollar their case this week involves a woman found dead after a scheduled internet date suspects include online contacts and her daughters boyfriend by todays standards theres nothing especially liberated about these women feminists are not the only ones who will notice that theres something silly about the way these professionals pause in the middle of murder investigations to discuss men and relationship issues should i go on a blind date the first date since my divorce how do i get my husband attracted to me again yet there are two things that let us look past this and enjoy the ride one is the appeal of the main characters who seem like nice decent people worth rooting for the other is the seriess uncomplicated honesty about the modern female dilemma men may be creeps and we see all manifestations here from the guys who hate successful driven women to the ones who simply ditch them for blond homebodies named heather men may barge ahead and make investigative mistakes that the more intuitive minds of women never would yet the show also suggests that women who buy into the line that marriage is a trap or who methodically put career first really do risk ending up down a blind alley or as one character here says "you put your head down you get lost in your career you wake up ten years later and you realize that your job doesnt hug back " a corny line to be sure and the sort of lament that sounded a lot more hip and palatable when it was heard on "sex and the city " in fact the best general way to describe "murder club" is as a sort of nancy drew for adults with a little humor on the side america may have moved on too far for it but i hope not providing respite from the storm of life may be a respectable role for television but "silence of the bees" serves a higher purpose p m sunday on pbs but check local listings this documentary in the "nature" series is about a potential threat to our existence that is more immediate than anything we have heard about global warming it concerns the disappearance of honeybees across america and other parts of the world in a syndrome known as colony collapse disorder reports of abandoned hives have been making the news since and many people have by now heard that something is very wrong in the world of bees amid the wailing about melting polar ice caps and gas guzzling cars however warnings about a mass honeybee die off barely seem to have registered the implications are grave indeed fruits vegetables flowers nuts the bulk of our entire food supply depends on pollinators notably the honeybee but their numbers have been dwindling across america and in certain other countries as well with healthy colonies collapsing sometimes in a matter of a few days there have been mass bee deaths in the past this time however scientists have not been able to discover a cause or a cure are the insects plagued by a deadly virus bacteria or parasite are they being killed by pesticides or are they dying of malnutrition due to the cumulative effect of a host of stresses have we worked them to death with the task of pollinating single crops on mega farms each promising theory runs into trouble though pesticides cant be the determining factor for instance because areas of organic farming are affected too "silence of the bees" is not hysterical in its alarmism it notes that as worried researchers contemplate the end of life as we know it there is still debate about how widespread the problem is meanwhile the film fills us with appreciation and even affection for the little creatures to whom we owe so much of our sustenance but theres no missing the ominous message at the end even if it is almost impossible to absorb "scientists are now closely monitoring the countrys commercial beehives as winter approaches there are signs that the colonies are not as strong as they should be " who sits through a four hour documentary about tom petty and the heartbreakers p m monday on the sundance channel perhaps somebody who notices that "runnin down a dream tom petty and the heartbreakers" comes from filmmaker peter bogdanovich and wonders how yet another famous director will handle yet another rockumentary meatier more iconic subjects dylan the band and even neil young have already been taken so mr bogdanovich gets credit for focusing on a group that is notable chiefly for reliably good music mr pettys gifted songwriting and mostly tame egos famous friends and fans appear in the assembled footage among them george harrison stevie nicks and the man with arguably the best ever voice for rock eddie vedder at one point mr petty is seen in a beard that makes him look like the face in the shroud of turin such distractions aside "runnin down a dream" is straight ahead stuff that pays off chiefly in the tidbits about how music is made viewers accustomed to pretention and hagiography in their rock tributes will not find much of either here
