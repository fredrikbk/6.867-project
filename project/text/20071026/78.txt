politics &amp economics u s turns up the heat on iran sanctions against banks military unit carry risks impact on foreign firms washington by imposing a broad set of financial restrictions on iran the bush administration has set out to break down tehrans elite military units and isolate its merchant class all with an eye toward inducing change in the country the administration also appears to hope that by striking such a tough stance it will prod or even alarm allies into following suit in isolating tehran but the moves combined with heightened rhetoric against tehran for its nuclear program and alleged support of terrorism are raising concerns at home and abroad that the administration is laying the groundwork for military action that has the potential to backfire by pulling apart the fragile coalition of countries working to cobble together international sanctions the white houses hawkish stance contributed to further roiling in the global oil markets yesterday with crude oil spiking to a record close of &# a barrel iran condemned the u s moves saying they would bring further instability to the middle east "the hostile policies of america are against international regulations and have no value " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini said in irans state owned media yesterdays announcement by the state department and treasury specifically targeted irans elite military unit the iranian revolutionary guard corps as well as key state owned banks companies and officials that u s officials charge with supporting terrorist and proliferation activities the sanctions are the stiffest since when iranian militants seized the u s embassy in tehran and held its staff hostage for more than a year they also mark the first time the u s has directly imposed sanctions against the armed forces of a sovereign nation u s officials said they expect the measures will force european asian and middle eastern nations to curb business ties with iran fearing possible u s penalties only american companies are directly affected by the sanctions any assets found in the u s belonging to the designated groups must be frozen americans are also forbidden to do business with the designated organizations but foreign companies could also potentially be blacklisted if they are found to be aiding iranian activists the u s has the worlds largest economy and the most influential banking system and much of the worlds business is done in dollars firms aiding irans oil and gas sector are seen as particularly exposed as companies controlled by the revolutionary guards such as the engineering firm khatam ol anbia now dominate the energy sector asian and european firms investing in irans gas fields and oil pipelines include frances total sa spains repsol ypf sa royal dutch shell plc and south koreas hyundai group "the sanctions are a shot across the bow of the entire energy sector " said one u s official who worked on the sanctions other western companies working in iran such as frances auto companies psa peugeot citroen and renault sa and swedens telecommunications giant telefon ab l m ericsson also could be vulnerable because of their involvement in sectors controlled by the revolutionary guards said western diplomats administration officials expressed optimism that the actions could work to freeze tehran out of the global financial system as foreign businesses fear being tarnished by their association with iranian entities "as awareness of irans deceptive behavior has grown many banks around the world have decided as a matter of prudence and integrity that irans business is simply not worth the risk " treasury secretary henry paulson said "it is plain and simple reputable institutions do not want to be the bankers for this dangerous regime " washingtons strategy however faces numerous obstacles said diplomats and businessmen and has raised fears internationally about possible military action many european asian and arab states have indicated an unwillingness to risk their business and diplomatic ties with iran at a time when its energy assets are in increasing demand a number of diplomats also said washingtons aggressive action risked ripping apart the countries working for a third round of international sanctions against iran through the united nations russia and china which hold veto power at the u n security council are allies or business partners of iran and have resisted the drive for new u n sanctions "i think running around like a lunatic with a razor and waving a red banner isnt the best way to solve this kind of problem " russian president vladimir putin said in response to the announcement questioned by reporters in portugal where he is attending a summit of russian and european union leaders he added that sanctions "worsen the situation leading it to a dead end " key gulf states are also voicing wariness about challenging an iran that is increasingly aggressive and cash rich the united arab emirates city of dubai serves as irans principal overseas financial center according to businessmen and diplomats and the six member states of the gulf cooperation council gcc recently signed a free trade agreement with iran even as these countries have taken some steps to crack down on military sales to iran and syria said u s officials "we cannot ignore the importance of iran in terms of the gcc economy " abdulla bin ahmed al saleh the united arab emirates undersecretary for economics said in a recent interview before the sanctions were announced "we have a long history of trade relations with them " the u s sanctions announced yesterday hit irans revolutionary guard corps along with eight affiliated companies and five guard officials and the guards elite

saderat officials have denied wrongdoing in prior statements responding to u s allegations their offices were closed for the day at the time of the latest allegations as were those of bank mellat the new designations could prove particularly troublesome for iranian businesses because of their role in facilitating trade after the other big state run banks were sanctioned by the u s and most banks in western europe either curtailed ties or cut them off altogether the latest moves "will make it much more difficult for iranian businesses to engage in international commerce financed by their state owned banks " mr levey said the sanctions come amid a general hardening of the white houses stance on iran this week ambassador david satterfield the state departments top iraq adviser told reporters that u s officials had "no question in our minds whatsoever" that "the most senior levels of the iranian government" were actively involved in the funneling of advanced iranian weaponry to iraq but administration critics pointing to past intelligence failures on iraq say administration hawks may be distorting the evidence in an attempt to make the case for a military attack on iran the military has presented confiscated weapons that it claims were manufactured in iran but neither the administration nor the military has ever presented conclusive evidence of iranian government involvement in any weapons shipments iran has long denied funneling any of its armaments into iraq yochi j dreazen in washington and chip cummins in dubai contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications
