weekend journal review music britney bested by her backups blackout britney spears jive records &# its unfair to suggest that britney spears is only a figurehead on "blackout" jive her fifth solo album but shes such a distant presence on the recording that its hard to accept that she was a driving force behind its creation a phalanx of producers and backing vocalists exert more of an influence on a disc thats not quite a mess but only occasionally rises above a muddle many of todays dance pop albums are built by committee and when such an album works it allows different textures to form an aural melange under the voice as happened on ms spearss album "in the zone" jive a smart charismatic piece of commercial pop but seems a long long time ago when listening to "blackout " the backing tracks are terrific theyre largely shaped by european rock influenced electronica via daft punk and their artistic offspring justice as well as by the four beats to a bar rhythms of timbaland but as a vocalist ms spears sounds weary snide and at times disconnected on some songs her voice seems grafted to the material as if an afterthought its not just an issue of how she was recorded though her voice is sometimes enhanced beyond recognition by digital sound manipulators akin to vocoder and autotune if youre unfamiliar with the sound they produce listen to chers "believe" for the autotune effect and daft punks "harder better faster stronger" for vocoder thats how vocals for dance music are recorded these days but the brightness in ms spearss voice thats so winning on her previous albums is all but gone when she ventures into the upper register as she does in "radar " shes surrounded by other voices only in "hot as ice " a snappy slice of pop r&amp b does she assert herself she sings mostly in the mid range where her presence is modest her sound thin and nasal at the bottom register her voice is a throaty bleat on several tracks the strongest statements are made by r&amp b singer songwriter keri hilson and by backing vocalists like corte ellis of the production team souldiggaz who adds a funny bit of licentiousness to "get naked i got a plan " check out ms hilson on timbalands "shock value" blackground released earlier this year and compare her contributions to his songs where shes the featured vocalist with what she delivers on "blackout " she seems just as much a presence here as on the timbaland disc the crackling backing tracks give "blackout" its allure "piece of me" ventures into justice territory with its heavy snarling bottom and siren like synths created by bloodshy &amp avant the swedish team behind ms spearss "toxic" hit single in marcella araica and danjas "get naked" swings under a steady pulse thats mitigated by whirling keyboards and voices for fans of giorgio moroder and s synth pop freescha and kara dioguardis foundation for "heaven on earth" will be familiar terrain would it be churlish to suggest karaoke versions of these tracks might be preferable to whats here analyzing lyrics for most dance tunes is dicey theyre not the point nor are the likes of leonard cohen writing them but on "blackout " ms spears makes the mistake of self reference "im miss bad karma another day another drama guess i cant see the harm of working and being a mama " she sings in "piece of me " one suspects ms spearss losing custody of her two children had little to do with her work habits and her story is too well known to her fans for such distortion the song which is the second on the disc serves to remind us of the singers seemingly unruly life as pharrell williams who wrote the discs finale "why should i be sad " told mtv about ms spears "youre seeing a reality show that no ones producing that no ones directing and thats a problem " with "blackout " ms spears fails to deliver a recording that will re establish her as a dominant pop star rather than a year old woman who seems bent on self destruction the hit single "gimme more" and the contributions well assume she inspired and perhaps coaxed from the producers suggest her career is far from finished "blackout" is more than serviceable as a dance record if it isnt high quality pop its not quite an utter defeat for the embattled ms spears mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop music critic
