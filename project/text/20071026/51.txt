marines called murderers without benefit of trial in reaction to your oct editorial "what happened at haditha " in which you wrote that "congressman jack murtha a decorated combat veteran made accusations of war crimes and said the marines had killed in cold blood " yes rep murtha is a decorated marine and i have the utmost respect and admiration for his service to this nation i too am a former marine although certainly not a decorated marine but being decorated does not grant mr murtha the right as a u s congressman to accuse fellow marines of killing in cold blood mr murtha has taken an oath to prererve and protect the constitution of the united states and the last time i checked a presumption of innocence until proven guilty is granted to all of us mr murtha apparently for political purposes has decided to trash the constitution for that in my opinion he should turn in his resignation jim lawrence sandwich mass as time rolls on and the truth finally is known it will become very difficult to apply that truth to the layers upon layers of emotions based upon lies it is this that the anti war movement counts on to move public opinion in its direction its a shame we didnt learn from the mistakes of our handling of the brave soldiers who served in vietnam that failure is now being shown in the anti war tactics today which seek to stop war by trashing those who volunteered to defend our nation bill dennington austell ga
