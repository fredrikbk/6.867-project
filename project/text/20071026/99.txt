to trump small brewers beer makers get crafty for years makers of small batch "craft" beers have been chipping away at the market share of americas three beer giants now the big brewers are craftily playing the same game and winning back much of the momentum the major brewers generally avoid using the parent companys name on the labels for their craft beers anheuser busch cos for example lists green valley brewing co as the maker of its wild hop lager an organic beer sunset wheat from jacob leinenkugel brewing co is owned by sabmiller plc blue moon brewing co is a owned subsidiary of molson coors brewing co but the parent company isnt mentioned on its beer labels through the first eight months of this year retail sales of craft beers made by those companies or their affiliates grew at nearly three times the rate of independent craft brews according to market research firm nielsen co sales of craft beers affiliated with the big three brewers in grocery drug convenience and major market liquor stores surged to &# million through aug against year earlier levels excluding sales at wal mart stores inc nielsen found wal mart doesnt supply sales data to nielsen or any other data tracking firm sales of independent craft brands rose to &# million the big brewers brands which include such top sellers as molson coorss blue moon and millers henry weinhards private reserve accounted for of the category an increase of four percentage points from a year earlier the growth shows how the giants although they can be lumbering are able to leverage their huge advantages in staff size marketing and distribution to quickly gain a foothold in emerging categories of the beer industry "its a combination of great branding and strong distribution muscle " says nick lake a nielsen vice president who tracks the industry typically craft beers are made by small independent breweries and feature traditional ingredients such as malted barley in some cases nontraditional ingredients such as chocolate or raspberries are added for distinctiveness some beer aficionados and industry executives deride the brews made by big companies as "faux" crafts "any brand put into the marketplace with an intentional lack of affiliation with the brewery brewing it i consider that a faux craft " says tom mccormick executive director of the california small brewers association "its intentional deception " the major brewers say theyre not trying to deceive anyone "we see blue moon as being a special brand " says andy england chief marketing officer of coors brewing co the u s unit of molson coors its "no more relevant than kashi cereal being owned by kellogg or lexus being owned by toyota " he says craft beers represent of u s beer revenue but theyre the fastest growing segment theyre attractive to big brewers because they command higher prices a sunset wheat six pack can be bought at stores for &# while a miller lite six pack goes for &# the growth rates of the big brewers are helped by the fact that they are starting from a smaller sales base still the jump shows how much influence they have over beer consumption in the u s beer generally must be sold through distributors and the big brewers have far larger distribution networks than independent brewers do if a mass market brewer wants to add a new brew to its lineup it can more easily attract an audience for it "theres nobody better than these three networks they can get these beers on shelves overnight " says bump williams general manager of the beer wine and spirits practice of market research firm information resources inc the major brewers mostly promote their craft brands through word of mouth a departure from the drumbeat of tv commercials touting their mass market brands to spur interest the companies have had representatives meet with bar owners to teach them how to talk up the brands attributes the companies also host tasting dinners at bars or restaurants where they pair their beers with certain foods that bring out the flavor miller brewing the u s unit of londons sabmiller has arguably been the most aggressive of the three big brewers in trying to expand its craft beers over the past year it has introduced its leinenkugels portfolio of brands into new states giving it a presence in jake leinenkugel president of the leinenkugels division was excited about the expansion but also a bit worried he said miller brewing chief executive tom long told him "jake youre going to fail in some markets which ones " mr leinenkugel said he responded "new york boston and washington d c " that is because years ago leinenkugels strong in the upper midwest tried to expand to the east coast but ended up pulling out but much to his surprise the brands have beaten sales expectations on the east coast this year total leinenkugels volume or quantity of beer sold is up for the year to date "consumers are so willing and wanting to try new things especially in beer styles " mr leinenkugel says he also credits the mobility of american society and the "power of the web" for raising awareness of the brand it took years for the brand to "really connect" with distributors mr leinenkugel says miller bought jacob leinenkugel brewing in the company based in chippewa falls wis is one of the oldest brewers in the u s dating to mr leinenkugel and his brother dick are fifth generation brewers millers name isnt on the packaging for leinenkugels products other big brewer craft brands have taken years to catch fire coors launched blue moon a belgian style wheat beer in by sales were so meager that the company was considering scrapping it says coorss mr england but the brand began to attract fans in the midwest thanks mostly to some hard working coors distributors he says they taught bartenders "to serve blue moon in a glass with a slice of orange " which caught drinkers attention he says this year the blue moon roster led by the belgian white variety increased sales by more than at u s grocery drug and convenience stores according to nielsen data mr england says it is among the best selling of all crafts anheuser busch lacks a star craft brew that it produces but it has a wide portfolio and several of the brews are posting sales growth such as ziegenbock amber sold only in texas the label says the product is "brewed and bottled by anheuser busch inc houston texas " anheuser busch also owns big stakes in several craft brewers including a roughly stake in oregons widmer bros brewing co some independent craft brewers say their growth rates are slowing because of the distribution power of the large brewers bob sullivan head of marketing at boulevard brewing co of kansas city mo said the company had expected to increase sales at a percentage in the high teens this year but now expects a rate of about "we introduced some new brands and packaging " says mr sullivan "and with what miller bud and coors are doing it turned out to be maybe not the best timing " the big brewers actions have also made boulevard more cautious about expanding into new markets which requires heavy investments in salespeople and advertising mr sullivan says now "it is much more difficult and costly when you go into a market " he says some craft brewers say the giants move into the category is a good thing because theyre bringing new legions of craft drinkers into the fold even if the independent brewers market share falls they may enjoy higher sales and profits as the category grows "go blue moon " says greg owsley chief brand officer at colorados new belgium brewing co the maker of fat tire amber ale a leading craft beer
