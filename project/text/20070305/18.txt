city council race shows changed face of beverly hills iranian born mr delshad vies for mayors job printing ballots in farsi beverly hills calif when voters here go to the polls tomorrow jimmy delshad is a favorite to be re elected to the city council under the citys system he would also become mayor the first iranian born mayor of this glitzy city known around the world more for its palm trees and movie stars than its sizable jewish iranian american population at a time when tension between the u s and iranian governments is on the rise mr delshad a year old jewish immigrant is on the brink of becoming one of the highest ranking iranian american elected officials in the u s so what are some of the political issues he feels most passionate about traffic light timing reducing sprinkler water use at local parks and even beautifying the citys alleys "i want to make beverly hills one of the safest cities in the nation in order to protect our residents and visitors " mr delshad said in a recent interview "oh and free wireless too " roughly of the approximately residents of beverly hills are of iranian descent an influx that began in earnest nearly years ago after the fall of the shah of iran and has fundamentally changed one of americas most iconic cities the sensitivity of the situation was underscored recently when the city for the first time printed its entire ballot in english and farsi a move that prompted an outpouring of complaints including a number from iranian americans six candidates in tomorrows election will be vying for two seats on the beverly hills city council three are persian mr delshad who changed his first name to jimmy from jamshid when he became a u s citizen first won election to the city council in if re elected he would become mayor council members rotate the job each year based on seniority while mr delshad effectively mobilized the persian community to vote in larger numbers than ever before during his campaign he has said this race should be tougher as an incumbent he has received the endorsement of both of the citys local newspapers however in a small city like beverly hills which traditionally sees a low voter turnout results can be unexpected a former computer entrepreneur mr delshad says hes not fazed by seeking a high profile role at a time when the u s and iran are facing off on the world stage "it doesnt keep me up at night " he says "this is the bed i made and im going to sleep in it " a registered democrat mr delshad declined to comment on the global issues surrounding iran he prefers to focus on challenges facing other small town mayors like traffic congestion and development but because beverly hills is so prominent hes also keenly interested in securing the city against possible terrorist strikes he wants to increase video surveillance in public spaces and continue to add license plate scanners to police vehicles at times he has worried for his own safety in during his first city council campaign mr delshad hired three bodyguards after he received written death threats in his native farsi language he also carried a panic button that could summon local police he says he never knew who was behind the threats or why he received them but he kept the bodyguards for a few months even after he was elected while there have been other iranian born candidates for public office mr delshads election would be a watershed says trita parsi president of the national iranian american council in washington "this is a man with long ties in the community who has risen through the process " dr parsi says mr delshad has lived in the u s nearly years the last in beverly hills the demographics of todays beverly hills are a far cry from days past early residents included douglas fairbanks and mary pickford who built their "pickfair" mansion here in charlie chaplin gloria swanson and buster keaton also called the city home its first honorary mayor was humorist will rogers hollywood stars and executive moguls still live here today but beginning with the islamic revolution in thousands of iranians most of them jewish immigrated to the city and over the next few years sent for relatives once here the immigrants retained strong family bonds and connections often keeping them from integrating into the larger community mr delshad and others say disputes have surfaced in zoning battles over so called "persian palaces " large homes decorated in a sometimes gaudy style that some said clashed with the surroundings the city found compromises some brokered by mr delshad in the city passed an ordinance that greatly restricted the proliferation of such structures by offering specific design choices and a review board for new homes the split in the community was nowhere more evident than at sinai temple a year old conservative jewish congregation a few blocks west of city limits today persian members account for nearly half of its families says its rabbi david wolpe the influx of persian families caused tensions and some longtime congregants left the temple everyone else self segregated sitting on opposite sides of the aisle he says in mr delshad was elected president of the temple which he says may be the first time an iranian american has led a temple founded and previously run by european jews "jimmys presidency here was a way of saying that you can have a persian president of an american synagogue and the sky doesnt fall " says mr wolpe today both he and mr delshad say assimilation of the cultures has reduced the tensions at the temple and in beverly hills "the fact that persians have been in the community for many years now and have issues theyre concerned with things like their kids and zoning issues requires them to get more involved in things that affect their lives " mr wolpe adds mr delshad born in the southern iranian city of shiraz came to the u s in following his brother then a college student to mankato minn their father a jeweler and goldsmith in iran would later join his sons in the u s mr delshad took university extension courses and worked as a janitor to make ends meet he and two brothers eventually formed the "delshad trio" playing the santur a persian string instrument they moved to los angeless growing iranian community playing music as they put themselves through college after graduating with a degree in electrical engineering mr delshad joined a fledgling computer firm for about two decades he ran his own computer hardware company which he sold in when he became president of the temple married years he is the father of two grown children the recent dustup over the farsi ballot demonstrated that despite strides the iranian community has made its presence can still be a lightning rod city hall has received about complaints since absentee ballots went to voters at the beginning of last month says byron pope the citys clerk who decided to translate the ballots into farsi a separate spanish ballot is available too mr pope says he made the move in consultation with an outside election services firm and was complying with the federal voting rights act which says that a jurisdiction that has more than of its voting age population in "a single language group" should have a ballot available in that language in the city election some information was translated into farsi but not the entire ballot he says for mr delshad the ballot issue was a "blip that most people have gotten over " traffic he says is the true beverly hills issue of the day
