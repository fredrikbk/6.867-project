weekend at obamas false hope springs eternal which is one way to look at the recent concordat between barack obama and john mccain to "save" the public financing of presidential election campaigns in case you havent been following this political version of "weekend at bernies" and you need a hobby if you have nearly every major presidential candidate has decided not to abide by public spending limits for the campaign that includes messrs obama and mccain this decision is entirely rational because the amount of money needed to compete in the primaries exceeds the limits imposed by our campaign finance scolds but now comes the illinois senator to say that if he wins the democratic nomination he will ask his gop opponent to agree with him to accept public money and spending limits for the general election mr mccain quickly matched the offer in some media precincts this is being hailed as an achievement and other candidates are being challenged to follow suit we hope they dont the public financing regime is collapsing of its own misguided assumption that only public money in politics is uncorrupting but campaign limits on individual contributions have instead made candidates even more reliant on organized special interests and they reduce political competition by favoring the rich and famous messrs obama and mccain are trying to prop up a policy corpse that deserves to rest in peace
