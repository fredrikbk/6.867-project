monthly mutual funds review real estate slowdown no sign of it in sector funds office landlords hotels are among top picks mr bigmans hurt fist for the past two years financial advisers have warned that the best days may have passed for real estate mutual funds and yet they keep gaining these funds were up an average this year through feb according to morningstar inc almost no category save emerging markets and precious metals can top the five year results of real estate real estate funds on average have gained nearly a year over the period while the broader market has stumbled factors driving the category most recently include private equity investors acquisitions of property companies to make sense of the sector we turned to theodore bigman a managing director at morgan stanley mr bigman has run real estate securities investing for the wall street firm since and oversees mutual funds including morgan stanley institutional u s real estate a which ranks in the top among peers for the past months three years and decade his van kampen real estate securities a is in the top for each of those periods here are excerpts the wall street journal are you a bull or bear right now mr bigman the sector has had phenomenal performance in the past one year five years years etc those who continue to bemoan real estate stocks continue to focus on metrics that are not appropriate valuation metrics for reits such as dividend yields or earnings multiples the average dividend yield for the reit sector which is at an all time low and now is below the yield on year treasurys has declined from to around mid and the reit sector is trading at right around an all time high multiple of earnings so they appear expensive on these metrics but those factors have been true for several years the right metric to look at is how the stocks trade in relation to the value of their underlying assets or the net asset value of the portfolios of these companies the price of the stocks has gone up because the nav has gone up in our fists were bare from banging the table and telling clients that these stocks were trading at discounts to their nav we were pleading with clients to give us money to make them money where are we today weve told investors for a while that over the medium to long term they should expect real estate stocks to outperform bonds but underperform equities if you take consensus expected returns for equities and bonds thats ish annually for real estate the bottom line is you shouldnt have zero in real estate unless you think stocks will generate returns and bonds or wsj would you advise investors to take some money off the table mr bigman if youre thinking of taking money off the table think about going from u s to global real estate expected returns globally will be a little better than in the u s youll get better returns and better diversification wsj how much should investors allocate to real estate stocks mr bigman this will vary depending on individual time horizon and risk return preferences but we can tell you that most institutional investors are in the single digits to of a portfolio and most are expanding their allocations to include exposure to the global real estate markets wsj private equity firm blackstone group recently battled vornado realty trust to acquire equity office properties trust the nations largest office owner why are office buildings in such demand as investment vehicles mr bigman its economics supply has lagged behind demand due to previous rents not justifying the costs of new construction which has positioned the office sector in a sweet spot at the moment we have had decent rent growth in plus room left in and part of with this strong rental growth however supply will catch up and dampen further growth the developers are entrepreneurial wsj is the recent burst of leveraged buyouts a sign of the sectors top mr bigman the high level of take private activity says to me that pretty sophisticated market participants believe the reits were trading at valuations comparable to direct real estate and nav calculations are not fictitious wsj industry executives have sold a lot of reit shares isnt this worrisome mr bigman no its a little unfair to ask ceos not to diversify their personal portfolios most of these companies came public between and and have year options that are massively in the money so im not surprised by the sales wsj morgan stanley real estate and van kampen real estate securities funds earlier this year were closed to new investors is that a sign youre finding fewer good investment ideas mr bigman we manage &# billion in global real estate securities and we emphasize performance we thought it prudent to restrict new inflows to make sure we can continue to find opportunities for existing investors the total capitalization of the u s real estate securities market is about &# billion and &# billion globally so at some point we might have felt we were at the point where we couldnt generate the same performance wsj how do you compute price to nav as most companies dont publish their nav as they do results like earnings and sales mr bigman we rip apart their financials and determine what their cash flows and real estate portfolios are worth we dont consider ourselves stock investors we are real estate investors wsj which areas of the real estate market are you favoring mr bigman the only sector were excited about in the u s is hotels it is hard and expensive to build brand new major high end hotels in cities like new york los angeles chicago and boston and the companies we favor are concentrated in these markets and trade at discounts to nav we feel real good about starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide inc hilton hotels corp and host hotels &amp resorts inc which are in our top holdings on the margin a number of apartment reit stocks are cheap relative to their nav though not quite as cheap as they used to be equity residential is one after the acquisition of equity office properties it is obvious that no company is too big to be taken over wsj so many small investors want to know what is going on with the housing sector mr bigman we invest in companies that own and operate real estate so home builders dont fit into a classic real estate portfolio twenty percent of our portfolio is in property companies that own rental apartments there are a few overheated markets but most rental markets are in pretty good shape wsj should an investor put less money in real estate mutual funds if he or she owns a home mr bigman you have to live somewhere that should be a separate decision to how you invest
