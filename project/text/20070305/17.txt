chinas military buildup spurs concerns china says it plans to boost military spending by nearly this year the largest increase in a decade in a move that could raise tensions with the u s a spokesman for the national peoples congress which is set to approve chinas annual government budget this week said china is trying to strengthen its armed forces in step with its rapid economic growth he added that the increase would fund improvements in military technology as well as raise soldiers pay the growth in chinas publicly disclosed defense spending which many analysts believe understates the total actually devoted to military programs has drawn criticism from top u s officials who question chinas intentions during a visit to australia late last month vice president dick cheney said chinas "fast paced military buildup" is "not consistent with chinas stated goal of a peaceful rise " china disclosed the spending figure just before a meeting between deputy secretary of state john negroponte and chinas foreign minister li zhaoxing in beijing speaking later to reporters mr negroponte said that while pentagon officials in the past had discussed the issue of the defense buildup with the chinese military he remained unclear about chinas motivations for the buildup "we think its important in our dialogue that we understand what chinas plans and intentions are " he said "this is in our view a perfectly reasonable suggestion which we would hope that they take into account " the npc spokesman jiang enzhu acknowledged such concerns speaking to reporters yesterday he noted that "in international society there are some people who are greatly concerned about chinas defense spending " mr jiang said the increases are "still compensating for the weak foundation in national defense" that resulted from insufficient government investment during the s adding "china will not become a threat to any country " despite double digit increases in recent years including last years rise chinese defense spending remains far below that of the u s and other major powers in both relative and absolute terms chinas defense budget for this year amounts to nearly &# billion the u s defense budget for the fiscal year which ends sept is expected to top &# billion chinas spending is equivalent to somewhat more than of the countrys gross domestic product the u s spends about of gdp on defense even so the u s and chinas asian neighbors are increasingly concerned about chinas strengthening military worries that escalated markedly after chinas successful test of an antisatellite missile in january chinese officials appeared taken aback at the international reaction to the unannounced missile test and have lately issued a number of statements meant to reassure foreign capitals that beijing harbors no aggressive intent but china is determined to improve the technological capacity of its million member armed forces which still lag far behind those of developed countries in order to protect its increasingly global interests for chinese strategic thinkers the increased integration of china into the global economy is prompting a revolution in their views of the role of the military which has been focused for most of its existence on domestic threats territorial defense and border conflicts much of chinas military focus remains on taiwan which beijing views as part of its territory chinese leaders belief that their countrys military has been incapable of using force to take taiwan which buys weapons from the u s has long rankled and helped spur modernization efforts while not linking the military spending increase directly to taiwan mr jiang criticized the administration of president chen shui bian and reiterated chinas intent eventually to rule the island "we will strive with the greatest sincerity and the greatest effort to realize the prospect of peaceful reunification but we will never tolerate taiwan independence " mr jiang said in taipei president chen delivered strong pro independence remarks apparently aimed at provoking china and appealing to his base "taiwan should be independent taiwan should go by its own name " he said at a banquet marking the th anniversary of the pro independence group the formosan association for public affairs both countries retain "china" in their formal names with taiwan known as the republic of china and the communist ruled mainland officially called the peoples republic of china but in a bid to assert taiwans separate identity in the past year mr chens independence leaning administration has substituted "taiwan" for "china" at the post office and two big government companies
