thoughtful criticism can strengthen a weakening u s u k relationship in regard to kim r holmes and nile gardiners "the end of the affair " editorial page feb messrs holmes and gardiner note that americans automatically think of winston churchill and margaret thatcher when the conversation turns to the anglo american alliance but they do not mention that as british prime ministers both were very willing to stand up to america when they saw fit most americans know that and they respect it the churchill quote "america can always be relied upon to do the right thing after theyve tried everything else" is well known in washington so is margaret thatchers famous counsel to former president bush during the first gulf war that "it was no time to go wobbly " neither comment led to accusations of anti americanism rather both exemplify the long and healthy history of constructive criticism that has traditionally underpinned anglo american relations in this context shadow foreign secretary william hague in his recent speech to the royal institute of international affairs correctly identified the true departure from tradition as having been the blair governments continued unwillingness to criticize the bush administration and consistent with his vision for "friendship with honest criticism " mr hague stated clearly that both the u k and u s have important lessons to learn from the experience of iraq however messrs holmes and gardiner fail to mention that mr hague also called for the galvanizing of nato reform of multilateral institutions the defense of political freedom and the promotion of economic liberalism mr hague also advocated additional sanctions on iran while not ruling out military action it would be surprising if britains most important ally would see any of these positions as anything but supportive moreover conservative party leader david camerons speech on the fifth anniversary of sept was explicit that fighting terrorism is the most consuming concern for modern government he also called for an extension and deepening of our alliances in the persian gulf and for the establishment of a u k national security council again these are hardly positions that ought to give the u s any concern history shows that one of the great strengths of the anglo american marriage has always been its room for honest criticism and as churchill one the greatest atlanticists stated that "criticism may not be agreeable but it is necessary it fulfills the same function as pain in the human body it calls attention to an unhealthy state of things " if theres an anglo american affair thats about to end its the bizarre link up between a conservative republican president and a nominally left wing labor prime minister looking forward there is genuine concern about how a gordon brown premiership will affect the "special relationship " the pressures on mr brown from his own leftist colleagues to now turn away from america will be huge thats the immediate vulnerability in u k u s relations not the conservative partys continued willingness to offer thoughtful criticism valuable to sustaining the vitally important anglo american alliance a sinclair dunlop washington d c
