tv networks launch big campus push new nielsen system makes college students coveted ratings draw tv networks have discovered the value of the college student with nielsen media research now including college students living away from home in its tv ratings surveys some networks are starting to use attention grabbing market campaigns to boost ratings among the campus crowd networks such as the cw for instance are throwing costume parties themed to tv shows staging events at fraternity houses and spring break hot spots to polish their image with students "the animal house crowd now has a voice " says rick haskins executive vice president of marketing and brand strategy for the cw a joint venture between warner bros entertainment and cbs that launched last fall in the past tv networks had little incentive to market to the nations million college students because nielsen left college students living away from home out of its ratings surveys which advertisers use when deciding where to buy ad time "every time that we looked at the college audience we thought it was an important audience but it was difficult to justify spending against it because they werent measured " says michael benson executive vice president of marketing for walt disneys abc entertainment an exception has been viacoms mtv which has long devoted a significant chunk of its marketing budget to campus promotions nielsen decided to begin tracking college students viewing starting this year after finishing a three year pilot program sponsored by several tv networks in which people meters were installed in college viewing areas such as dorms the resulting data analyzed show by show for different periods revealed that the addition of college students boosted ratings for certain shows dramatically for example in november viewing of abcs medical drama "greys anatomy" increased among women to if college students were included similarly the cws "americas next top model" a reality show in which women compete for a modeling contract registered a increase in women viewers to years old in the same month even with these results networks need to do plenty of marketing on campuses some say given the competition they face from the internet and videogames for the attention of young viewers "they almost need to do these campaigns right now just so that they can keep the same ratings " says brandon evans managing director and partner for repnation a unit of youth marketing company mr youth with that in mind the cw many of whose programs skew younger arranged costume parties tomorrow night to promote the premiere of its new reality show "the next pussycat doll " which chronicles the search for a new member of the pop music group students are supplied with cat ears cat tails and fishnet stockings to wear to the parties where they crowd around tv sets to watch the show the cw is also sending pussycat doll posters coasters costume items and press releases to student run newspapers and tv stations to arrange the parties and distribute the promotional material the cw is tapping a group of college students on campuses across the country including harvard princeton the university of california at los angeles and the university of georgia who work as college marketing reps for cstv networks the cbs owned cable network devoted to college sports one of a number of such college marketing groups created by marketers or ad firms the cstv group was formed initially to promote the network but later began working with cstv advertisers says cstv chief executive brian bedol the cw also hired a new york marketing firm specializing in offbeat tactics aimed at the youth market alloy media + marketing to handle other college marketing efforts for both "the next pussycat doll" and "americas next top model " alloy plastered pictures of contestants from both programs all over the campuses including in bathrooms dining halls and dorm hallways the cw isnt alone in its campus push abc also is trying to attract college students with a promotion for its late night talk show "jimmy kimmel live " targeting different markets and colleges including los angeles philadelphia and raleigh durham n c the campaigns designed by alloy will feature viewing parties posters ads in print media and spots on mtvs college targeted cable channel mtvu the college centric promotion is the biggest campaign to date for the late night show "this is the type of audience that we want to get " says abc entertainments mr benson the tv networks face plenty of competition in their marketing efforts the growth of campus marketing networks such as cstvs group reflects a greater effort being made by marketers to boost their presence on campuses away from home and making purchasing decisions on their own for the first time college students are an attractive audience for marketers "these are tomorrows great consumers you have to grab them and convert loyalty at this age " says samantha skey executive vice president of strategic marketing for alloy
