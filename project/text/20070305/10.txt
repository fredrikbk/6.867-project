brussels punching bag each round of the european unions battle royal with microsoft has revealed more about flaws in the blocs antitrust office than about the stubbornness of the american software giant brussels latest sucker punch is no exception last thursday eu antitrust czarina neelie kroes threatened to fine microsoft up to million euros or about &# million a day because she doesnt like the prices the company wants to charge for licensing its technology the fines which would come on top of nearly &# billion in previous penalties in the three year old case are retroactive to december and could total as much as &# billion through last month microsoft has four weeks to respond the technology in question would allow non microsoft servers to work with servers and pcs that run the firms windows software ms kroes claims that "there is no significant innovation" in the programming codes to justify the prices microsoft has set but exactly how "innovativeness" should be measured in this case is disputed microsoft notes that agencies in the u s and europe have granted patents for this technology with applications still pending "this seems to be a case of one government agency patent offices disagreeing with another government agency the commission " microsoft general counsel brad smith tells us "the first agency actually has the expertise" to make these judgments he adds "the second says were not going to adhere to what they said " so brussels no longer acts as merely prosecutor judge jury and executioner in antitrust cases it now claims the power to assess the worth of patents too while no doubt the patent systems on both sides of the atlantic could use some work that doesnt seem to be the issue here the heart of the matter is revealed in ms kroess observation that other software makers provide comparable interoperability technologies at no cost eu antitrust officials make no secret of their preference for the open source business model practiced by the companies behind all the complaints against microsoft among them such heavyweights as ibm sun microsystems and oracle many of these firms dont want to pay anything to license microsofts technology the commission insists that it isnt asking microsoft to give away technology that has cost it multiple millions to develop in practice though that seems to be just what brussels wants commission officials are either unwilling or unable to describe exactly what microsoft would have to do for its technology to be deemed "new" enough its the old story of the eu punishing microsoft for not meeting a standard that was never specified if microsofts response doesnt satisfy ms kroes she could level an enormous fine for the second time since last april when an eu court in luxembourg heard microsofts appeal of the original ruling the commission argues that it is well within its rights to enforce its ruling unless it is overturned and thats true but the eu antitrust office has a poor track record with the luxembourg court several high profile decisions by ms kroess predecessor mario monti who issued the original microsoft ruling in have been overturned on appeal so one has to wonder if the commission is hedging its bets by issuing a series of fines each of which microsoft would have to appeal even if it wins the primary case perhaps the eus logic is that if the company wins the primary case on appeal a ruling is expected shortly it may still be willing to settle the noncompliance fines simply to get the commission out of its hair thus the eu wouldnt come away empty handed after such an epic fight maybe such thinking is too cynical even for eurocrats but even if thats not their intent threatening another multimillion dollar fine when the appeals court is due to rule soon on the original judgment smacks of spite see related letter "letters to the editor when antitrust enforcers become central planners" wsj march
