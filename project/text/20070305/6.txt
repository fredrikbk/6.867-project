boss talk reflections of a game guy probst soon to relinquish ceo post at electronic arts talks about industry changes when lawrence probst joined electronic arts inc more than two decades ago the videogame industry was a thoroughly undisciplined business filled with wildcat developers who would hit it big and suffer debilitating failures in even turns mr probst changed the game by introducing better management and marketing and emphasizing sequels helping to turn ea into a factory for dependable hits now ea is the biggest videogame publisher in the world with madden nfl need for speed and other highly lucrative titles last week mr probst said he plans to step down as chief executive of the redwood city calif company a post he had held since and that his former lieutenant john riccitiello will assume the top job on april mr probst years old will remain executive chairman of eas board the games industry itself is in a technology transition driven by new consoles such as sony corp s playstation microsoft corp s xbox and nintendo co s wii system at eas headquarters recently mr probst discussed his legacy in the business how the balance of power is shifting among hardware makers and the key initiatives under way at ea excerpts wsj why is now the right time for new leadership at ea mr probst when i first became ceo i said to myself i would do this for years that turned into years it just doesnt make any sense to be ceo for another five or six years and then go through another technology transition when you go back to we were moving from the playstation to playstation it was pretty straightforward and pretty simple this time it was the platform ps nintendo wii the hand helds the mobile platform the online opportunities the casual games space i think were through the choppy waters thats precisely the right time to put somebody new in the chair wsj sony dominated the last generation of games hardware how does this technology transition compare to those in the past mr probst youre going to see a much more competitive environment and thats really good for the third party software companies like ea wsj how do you think the playstation launch is going mr probst they ended up delivering about the number of units that we expected in north america the interesting thing to me is that people seem surprised that there might be some resistance to a &# price point by the time you buy the machine and a second controller and the high def cables and a few pieces of software and it gets taxed youre walking out the door with eight or nine hundred bucks missing out of your pocket thats a lot of money wsj has sony tried to do too much with it mr probst i dont think they have im not so sure that people have fully understood whats in that box theyre getting a thousand dollar blu ray player for playing high definition movies for free in that box it just feels like that is not being fully appreciated by consumers and it may take some time for that to happen wsj where do you see the biggest opportunities to make money from online gaming mr probst its a combination subscription revenue is what drives our pogo business a web site where subscribers can go play games weve got a massively multiplayer game in development called warhammer which we have high hopes for that will also be a subscription based business the early returns on dynamic in game advertising have been good so we think theres potential there the microtransaction segment is beginning to develop pretty significantly youve probably heard the story about our fifa online soccer game in korea we did million microtransactions at a price point of &# on average between aug and dec last year wsj you were selling uniforms for game characters and things like that mr probst yes power ups uniforms shoes let your imagination run wild in the last months weve done something like &# million in digital revenue and its growing pretty rapidly we think that numbers more than &# million in our next fiscal year wsj how big is the opportunity for selling advertising in games mr probst weve consistently said that in the foreseeable future we think thats in the tens of millions not hundreds of millions some of our competitors are out there saying its a hundreds of millions opportunity maybe long term it is wsj what makes you think it will grow that big mr probst i think advertisers looking for that to year old demographic are pretty clearly coming to the realization that those eyeballs are playing our games as opposed to watching network television ive got two sons that are in the middle of that demographic and they dont watch any network television with the potential exception of " " wsj at what point will people download videogames and stop going into wal mart target or best buy to buy them mr probst i dont think digital downloads are going to put retailers out of business anytime in the foreseeable future when we look at our overall business in fiscal were forecasting all of our online business plus our mobile platform business to be something in the neighborhood of to of our total business which would suggest that the rest is still transacted at retail wsj ea has said it wants to rely less on licensing intellectual property like movie characters for its games and beef up its roster of titles that are wholly owned by the company how has your progress been on that front mr probst i think this year well end up with wholly owned ip representing about of our business i think were on a good track spore a personal computer game expected out by april next year is obviously something that we have high hopes for were resurrecting the command and conquer franchise which we acquired a few years back weve got army of two in development which we think has great potential longer term the margins on wholly owned intellectual properties are really really compelling as development becomes increasingly more expensive it just makes sense from a margin standpoint to have as large a percentage of your portfolio be wholly owned intellectual property where you dont pay that licensing fee on top of platform fees and the cost of development and everything else wsj is one of the reasons you want to move away from licensed properties because hollywood simply wants a bigger piece of the pie mr probst the more successful you are the more the licensor wants to be paid that just is never going to change theres the issue of creative control and some licensees or licensors are easier to work with than others wsj why in the case of sports have you been willing to stomach the higher licensing fees to the national football league and others mr probst the sports business is a cornerstone of electronic arts as a company weve got something like a market share in sports it just doesnt make any sense to walk away from that you take a look at a product like madden which in calendar year was the number one best selling title in north america and revenues were up year over year i can predict with a fairly high level of certainty that that products going to be a top five product in north america every year to hand that over to somebody else on a silver platter that makes no sense to us wsj how likely is a big multibillion dollar acquisition of a games company by a big media company mr probst certainly could happen i dont think that anybody has gotten really close to it i know that analysis goes on all the time and whether somebody decides to pull the trigger hard to predict wsj how do you strike a balance between keeping people on your creative teams on deadline and budget and giving game designers like will wright the freedom to do what they do best mr probst will wrights our steven spielberg will kind of gets to do whatever he wants whenever he wants and we pretty much think its going to turn out well his track record is sim city and sims and we think hes on a terrific trajectory with spore which will allow players to guide the development of creatures from single celled organisms to complex societies wsj ea has been criticized by some wall street analysts for being risk averse do you agree mr probst if they have been critical at all its about the amount of r&amp d spending thats gone on at electronic arts over the last two or three years if you take a look at the number of new things that we have in our pipeline just in fiscal and i could tick off five or six things that are brand new intellectual properties that we think have tremendous potential the notion that were risk averse is just preposterous wsj what has the success of online games like world of warcraft taught you about where your priorities should be mr probst world of warcraft caught lightning in a bottle i know they didnt know what they had in hindsight i wish that we had gone out and acquired that business when it was for sale wsj do you play games yourself mr probst im playing tiger woods golf on the wii i like to play golf and this is fun
