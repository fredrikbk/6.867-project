business day sign up for the e mail here a raid on iraqi intelligence offices in basra yesterday exposed what british forces described as signs of torture and in a sectarian context but nouri al maliki condemned the british iraqi operation rather than its findings raising anew doubts about a u s reliance on the prime minister and his government the assault by iraqi special forces and u k troops targeted what the british called the headquarters of iraqs government intelligence agency in basra the principal city of the shiite dominate south the new york times reports inside they discovered prisoners including a woman and two children with some showing signs of torture a british statement said the forces were looking for a "known death squad leader " the bbc adds the discovery as the times notes was reminiscent of other recent american and british raids at police stations in basra or interior ministry facilities in baghdad where such abuse seemed to be rampant a ministry spokesman tells usa today it has fired or reassigned more than employees including high ranking police because they had tortured accepted bribes or had ties to militias nearly all such government torture allegations involve aggression by shiite officials against sunnis mr malikis promises to stamp out such practices despite his own reliance on the support of political forces intertwined with shiite militias are at the heart of bush administration faith in his ability to create a government representing all iraqis and yet mr maliki issued a statement condemning the basra raid and calling for punishment for "those who carried out this illegal and irresponsible act " the raid happened to come the same day u s and iraqi troops widened their security operation in baghdad to include sadr city the mostly impoverished shiite area that until recently was under de facto street control by the mahdi army a militia loyal to the anti u s cleric moqtada al sadr they carried out limited raids and there was no bloodshed in what officials described as the first step toward staking out a permanent binational security station there the los angeles times reports the mahdi fighters and checkpoints have melted away in recent weeks even as mr sadr and some of his top loyalists have stayed out of the public eye though he has continued to issue criticisms of both the u s and its tactics it is worth noting that twice since mid mr sadr withdrew his overwhelmed forces from the battlefield and regrouped them to fight another day the somewhat contradictory remarks of mr maliki come at a time when the post election debate in washington over iraq policy may have reached an impasse of sorts there seems little consensus among democrats and allied republicans about how or even whether to block president bushs plans to move forward in iraq and while the increased troop deployment in january was greeted as a strategic shift there is little sign that mr bush has shifted from the view he expressed last august that his "strategy" is to keep the u s in iraq until the country has become a sustainable democracy at a recent white house meeting with a group of governors mr bush and marine gen peter pace chairman of the joint chiefs of staff were asked about a possible backup plan for iraq if the new policies didnt work the washington post reports the governors concluded from the talk
