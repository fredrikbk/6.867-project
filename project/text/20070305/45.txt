monthly mutual funds review hunting for returns amt strikes in unlikely spot tax free muni bond funds the alternative minimum tax strikes again buying a tax exempt municipal bond fund is one of the most popular legal tax dodges it can help limit tax on interest from bond investments but this year more people than ever could discover that part of the interest paid by their muni funds is federally taxable they can blame the alternative minimum tax a parallel tax regime that the u s government adopted in the s to prevent the most affluent from avoiding taxes via deductions or loopholes because the criteria for paying the amt werent indexed to inflation the number of those hit by it has steadily risen and is predicted to soar for for bond fund investors the alternative tax applies only to certain bonds not to all of the interest a fund pays still "tax exempt" funds can have as much as one fifth of holdings in amt subject municipal bonds under securities and exchange commission rules exposure can vary dramatically by fund whats especially aggravating is that investors usually cant tell whether muni bond interest from this slice will be taxable until after they have tallied exemptions and deductions while preparing tax returns and then doing a separate amt tax worksheet few things seem to stir more ire among shareholders than learning that a tax exempt fund is partially taxable fund firms say many firms have begun limiting holdings of taxable munis and some have rolled out offerings that pledge not to own any taxable munis "people say i already owe more tax than i thought i would im not going to buy any muni fund that will make it worse " says r j gallo a senior fund manager at federated investors inc not all municipal bonds are the same interest on general obligation debt of states and local governments typically is exempted from federal and sometimes state income tax but that isnt usually true for "private activity" bonds sold to finance housing projects waste water treatment plants or recycling facilities interest from such bonds can be taxable for amt subject taxpayers if projects they finance benefit for profit companies private activity issues enjoyed strong demand a few years ago when the amt wasnt as big of an issue fund managers snapped up such bonds for their higher yields which can be a quarter of a percentage point above those of triple a issues among the most popular taxable issues were those sold in the late s to finance construction of airline terminals the bonds plummeted in value when air travel fell in the early s but then rebounded providing some of the best gains in the muni market funds that didnt own them during the recovery suffered in performance comparisons generally the older a muni fund the more likely it is to contain private activity issues thus for anyone with a sizable amount to invest its worth considering one of the newer amt free offerings but it is also important to consider other factors such as a funds expense ratio and its overall performance financial advisers say "everyone should look at long term after tax total returns " says fran kinniry a principal at mutual fund giant vanguard group a total return gauges how much a fund has gained or lost based on the interest it earns and any rise or fall in the value of the bonds it owns this information is often available on fund company web sites for most investors trying to tell how much amt debt a fund holds is daunting a prospectus can give a fund substantial flexibility to own amt debt but the fund may never have held any says scott berry an analyst at morningstar inc he recommends that potential investors call a financial adviser or the fund company directly the easiest route is to pick a fund that promises to be amt free among lower cost offerings morningstar cites fidelity tax free bond t rowe price tax free income and vanguard short term tax exempt funds vanguard is among the fund companies that have cut back on amt subject bonds recently making most of its muni funds amt free except for some that invest in money markets or high yield bonds a spokeswoman cites the fact that a growing number of the firms customers face the amt other firms offering tax free funds include charles schwab &amp co thornburg investment management inc and american century investments "people dont like to pay taxes when they are buying tax exempt funds so we do our best to make sure that they dont " says robert miller a muni bond manager at american century some funds intend to stick with their amt bonds "if we didnt invest in amt bonds at all that would basically take us away from some industrial development bonds that are extremely credit worthy and deserve our attention " says franklin ruben manager of aim high income
