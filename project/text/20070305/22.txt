eurolinks daily view pension world looks to swedens incentive based system online edition by pegging public pensions to individual earnings and overall life expectancy rates sweden has given people incentives to be more productive and retire later and in the process it has sidestepped the political paralysis that has stymied pension change elsewhere now this initiative implemented by stockholm nearly a decade ago is looking like the pension worlds next big thing as the need for global pension overhaul becomes critical swedens plan is conventional in that current workers contributions fund current retirees benefits much as the u s social security system does but calculating payouts according to salaries and aging projections gives it the flexibility to accommodate revenue and population shifts if the economy does poorly the thinking goes future pension payments will go down and the longer people in a particular age group are projected to live the smaller their pension payouts or at least thats the theory some eastern european nations have already ditched their struggling post communist systems and gone swedish steps taken in countries as diverse as brazil and russia boast some

think just happened and that will help determine the direction of financial markets in the coming weeks analysts see at least three ways to view last weeks trouble which resulted in a drop in the dow jones industrial average as e s browning reports goldman sachs economists ed mckelvey and andrew tilton outlined three competing views in a report last week first the retreat might have been a much overdue short term pullback the dow jones industrials hadnt fallen as much as from a high in more than seven months and hadnt fallen in almost four years that is an exceptionally long time without a serious hiccup if last weeks trouble was just a hiccup then stocks should rebound in the next few weeks and the trick is to pick out the stocks likely to rebound the most second it might have been a flight from risky investments if that is what is going on then the market shift is more serious at least for now this appears to be happening investors suddenly have pulled back from a raft of risky securities from developing country stocks and bonds to junk bonds and small stocks in the u s some analysts think that even if the problems are just temporary they could last a little longer third it might have been a sign of a weaker economy to come this could be the most troubling prognosis some investors took former u s federal reserve chairman alan greenspan at his word last week when he said a recession later this year couldnt be ruled out these investors see the flight to bonds as another sign that conservative investors are hunkering down for a period of economic trouble today with the economy appearing to be growing more like than annually bond yields and interest rate futures suggest that many investors think the fed will cut rates by summer to give the economy a boost the goldman economists too expect the fed to step in by june and begin cutting its target interest rates read e s brownings report http online wsj com article sb html read breakingviewss analysis http online wsj

but if potential leaders below are stifled by the burden of their day to day responsibilities or discouraged by the risk of sticking their necks out a company can miss out on the kind of innovation needed to flourish in a dynamic world however there are practical ways for managers below the top tier to play a leadership role that helps both them and their companies for senior managers there are ways to encourage this kind of leadership from below as james kelly and scott nadler of erm a global consulting firm focused on environment health safety and social management explain managers who succeeded in becoming leaders found two ways to spur the transition from service and governance roles to leadership roles first they reorganized their group to make themselves less essential to the provision of services or the exercise of governance this began to free up time and energy for leadership it also unlocked their staffs potential as roles they formerly dominated became opportunities for their subordinates growth second they opened themselves up to influences from outside the company in many companies middle managers have been trained to focus on internal rather than external signals to take on a leadership role managers needed to listen to the signals coming from outside customers competitors suppliers neighbors the media then they could begin thinking about what those signals meant for action inside the company this is just the beginning ceos cant change companies on their own the secret is to foster a leadership mentality throughout the ranks james kelly and scott

strengthening military worries that increased after chinas successful test of an antisatellite missile in january and even though its defense spending remains far below that of the u s and other major powers given beijings hostility to taiwan and chinas growing clout their concern is understandable as u s deputy secretary of state john negroponte says while pentagon officials in the past have discussed the issue of the defense buildup with the chinese military he remains unclear about chinas intentions of course beijing could allay such concerns by being more open about its plans read the
