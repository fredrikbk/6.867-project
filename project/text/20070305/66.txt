politics &amp economics white house tussles on doha schwab and paulson split on how to push global trade talks washington as angst over the shaky state of the u s trade agenda grows tensions are emerging within president bushs inner circle over how best to get the stalled doha round of world trade talks moving the chairman of the national economic council presidential friend allan hubbard and national security adviser stephen hadley have privately voiced frustration with the tortured pace of action in the latest stage of comprehensive talks launched in doha qatar soon after the terrorist attacks of sept the talks had as their primary aim better integrating poor nations into the global trading system messrs hubbard and hadley have pressed for a bolder u s offer in an effort to encourage other countries to compromise in one heated meeting among top bush aides just before christmas in the old executive office building u s trade representative susan schwab opposed the idea of a grand offer ms schwab who had seen a similar move by her predecessor flop pushed instead for "quiet negotiations" focusing on details to build trust among dohas participants mr bush sided with ms schwab and has continued to back her but she is now at risk of being overshadowed some fear undercut by new treasury secretary henry paulson who is moving deeper into the public debate on doha and trade in a speech thursday mr paulson said increased trade is "essential to our growth" and cited doha as especially important for the u s he noted that ms schwab who heads to europe this week to confer with counterparts there is "working hard to make progress toward a meaningful agreement " last week world trade organization chief pascal lamy told the wall street journal he was hopeful the u s and europe were ready to make enough concessions on cutting farm aid to reopen the doha talks soon but he said a final deal still would face major hurdles mr paulson who recently named a former deputy u s trade representative to handle his china portfolio will be abroad this week he plans to argue for improved capital flows and lower trade barriers during a swing through asia including a stop in seoul to pitch a free trade pact with south korea ahead of formal u s korean talks mr paulsons higher profile reflects the widening sense of urgency within the bush administration about the need to kick start washingtons trade agenda as doubts about the benefits of free trade and globalization have grown on capitol hill and among the public showing even modest progress on doha could give the democrat controlled congress impetus to renew the presidents trade negotiating authority which expires in june extending his ability to present trade deals for a straight up or down vote by lawmakers would in turn buy mr bush more time to close a doha deal with the president endorsing quiet diplomacy others in the administration are falling in behind ms schwab "we have looked to sues lead " mr hubbard said he said he doesnt recall the december meeting adding "we have a jillion meetings around here " a hadley spokesman declined to comment on "internal deliberations " for her part ms schwab said differences of opinion are healthy "you always have to be thinking about different tactics and strategies " she said but the trade official now faces pressure to show movement in administration meetings she has argued that informal meetings among major doha players show signs of progress and she will look smart if a deal comes together that is far from certain though hence mr paulsons coming push on doha which administration officials say is designed to give some broader political momentum to the initiative the danger is that mr paulson a former goldman sachs chairman could undercut ms schwabs credibility "you really risk further diminishing sue in this which is going to make it harder to get any deal " said grant aldonas the top trade official at the commerce department during mr bushs first term ms schwab isnt the first trade representative to get a chaperone in the s then treasury secretary james baker helped trade chief clayton yeutter close a controversial deal with canada clinton white house aide gene sperling accompanied then trade ambassador charlene barshefsky to beijing to finalize a deal paving the way for china to join the wto the group shepherding the doha talks after republicans lost control of congress in november ms schwab made it a priority to work with democrats even as she continued negotiations abroad but white house officials began looking to mr paulson who enjoys huge name recognition and respect overseas from his goldman sachs days to buttress her efforts "hes got an enormous amount of credibility " mr hubbard says mr paulson has a mandate from mr bush to roam across issues within the administration taking office a few months after ms schwab he has carved an ever greater role for himself as a free trade advocate aides to ms schwab and mr paulson said the two see their roles as complementary and consult two or three times a week things havent always gone smoothly in november mr paulson wrote an op ed piece on doha with his british counterpart gordon brown ms schwab was caught unawares the article was published the day before her own appearance at the u s chamber of commerce where she intended to make a postelection overture to democrats on trade mr paulson later apologized to ms schwab officials said trade talks recent milestones in global trade negotiations november latest round is launched
