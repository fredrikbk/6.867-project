politics &amp economics swedens pension antidote finds a global audience flexible payout system puts onus on individual a private account rule as aging populations and shaky public finances make overhauling pension systems a global priority an initiative implemented nearly a decade ago in sweden is looking like the pension worlds next big thing by pegging public pensions to individual earnings and overall life expectancy rates sweden has given its citizens incentives to be more productive and retire later and sidestepped the political paralysis that has stymied change elsewhere some eastern european nations have already ditched their struggling post communist systems and gone swedish steps taken in countries as diverse as brazil and russia boast some swedish elements a world bank book based on the swedish model has been translated into chinese and next month egypts government will review plans to chuck the countrys failing system for a swedish version "theres no magic solution to the pension problem but governments world wide are looking at" sweden says kent weaver political science professor at georgetown university in washington "its starting to be seen as the best among what are now seen to be imperfect options " swedens plan designed in part by an american expatriate is conventional in that current workers contributions fund current retirees benefits much as the social security system does in the u s but calculating payouts according to salaries and aging projections gives it the flexibility to accommodate revenue and population shifts if the economy does poorly the thinking goes future pension payments will go down and the longer people in a particular age group are projected to live the smaller their pension payouts will be or at least that is the theory the changeover was made in so not enough time has elapsed to thoroughly test it in fact swedens economy has done so well since when benefits started being calculated in part under the new rules that pensioners have received more than they would have under the old structure the downside is that if and when growth falters retirees will get less "it hasnt happened yet but it will " says ole settergren director of the pensions department at swedens social insurance agency that approach is a break from the typical pay as you go system which defines a guaranteed benefit in advance but often saddles the state with underfunded obligations particularly when times are bad swedens system "is not a good system if you want to subsidize leisure " says edward palmer a professor of social insurance economics at stockholms uppsala university and a colorado native who helped design the plan it can be a good system however for politicians wary of revamping pensions because it allows them to defer to a formula rather than promoting the unpopular options of later retirement and smaller benefits "the political discussions behind things like increasing the retirement age are much more cumbersome than if it just happens mathematically " says robert holzmann senior director of the world banks social protection unit in washington skeptics point out however that politicians still could eventually be pressured to change the system if benefits get too skimpy swedens plan has other critics it is a tough sell elsewhere in western europe where many see generous pensions as a right other critics include the international labor organization which holds that earnings related pensions should guarantee of a persons prior average earnings swedes unlike the majority of western europeans get no such assurance the system also preserves existing income inequality workers who earn more get more when they retire in the u s social security tracks what people pay through the bulk of their careers but it reroutes contributions from wealthier citizens to prop up poorer workers pensions the bottom line of the swedish model most people will have to work harder to reap the kinds of pensions their grandparents could take for granted "it puts the cost of aging onto the individual rather than onto society " says sarah brooks an ohio state university political science professor who has studied the plan last february the world bank endorsed the swedish plan as a possible antidote to pension woes world wide economists at the european central bank followed up last fall highlighting swedens approach for the nation euro zone where one third of the population will be older than by in countries with strapped budgets the swedish plans attraction is its premise that something is better than nothing in other words stingier payouts help ensure the system doesnt collapse that was crucial to persuading unions in egypt to endorse that countrys new swedish inspired pension plan "they know the old plan is generous but they also know it will not be there " says david robalino a world bank economist who has been working in egypt in poland where a public relations campaign helped ensure an enthusiastic transition to a swedish style system in the fiscal benefits are already clear a recent european union report said that despite having some of the worst demographics on the continent "the long term budgetary impact of aging in poland is the lowest in the eu " like sweden poland mandated that a slice of pension contributions go into private accounts similar to a k where the money is invested in mutual funds swedes contribute of their salaries to the pension system only a small portion of that percentage points is held in individual accounts poles contribute a total of of their gross salaries to the system with percentage points going into private accounts the concept of individual accounts has been key to selling the plan to swedes sweden sends its workers statements mailed annually in bright orange envelopes showing what they have put into their pension and what they would get at retirement the money isnt really there for them it is being paid to current retirees but advocates say seeing it expressed as an individual account should have the psychological effect of encouraging people to work longer to win bigger benefits it may be working swedens official retirement age is years old since the change took effect the average age at which swedes retire has risen to even partially adopting the swedish plan can have benefits brazil doesnt send its citizens annual statements and there is no private account component but individual contribution and life expectancy rates have been used to calculate private sector pension payouts since brazilian officials made the change after studying the swedish model and they have seen costs fall since perhaps the swedish plans biggest drawback is that it remains relatively untested the first wave of retirees who get all their benefits based on the new model wont hit for another few years and the country hasnt suffered a major economic slowdown since adopting the plan "it certainly has the virtue of spelling out in anticipation what people have agreed should happen " says olivia mitchell director of the pension research council at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school "but that doesnt necessarily mean that it will "
