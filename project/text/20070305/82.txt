recruiters are weighing similar moves companies are reacting to the rise of so called helicopter parents who take an active interest in their childrens postcollege plans in addition recruiters say college students and recent graduates rely more on parents for career advice than their predecessors did technology helps too cellphones and email facilitate constant contact so employers want to sell parents on their childrens job offers and pre empt parent phone calls about salary negotiations benefit details and ways to apply for a job employers are saying "if we cant beat them we might as well join them " says marcia harris director of career services at the university of north carolina at chapel hill last may merrill lynch invited the parents of some summer interns to visit its offices the parents toured the equities trading floor ate lunch at the offices heard presentations by merrill executives and asked questions about life at the firm the idea was to help parents become familiar and comfortable with the firm and its career paths merrill piloted the idea last year with a small group of african american interns because the competition to hire those students is particularly intense the program will be expanded to include more interns this year merrill says the pitch worked for toyin mafe her daughter eniola now a senior at spelman college in atlanta planned to spend last summer interning at merrill ms mafe a postdoctoral researcher wanted to know more about merrills business she says she got a good look "behind the scenes " she also worried about how eniola would get home safely after working late a managing director said late working employees can call a car service "i was more than convinced" the firm was a good fit for her daughter the elder ms mafe says "they appeared to me as a company that is able to take care of its employees " last fall eniola mafe weighed several offers from banks for full time jobs in daily phone chats her mother rooted for merrill "youve got mentors there people who you can talk to you know the culture there " toyin mafe counseled when it came to making a decision her daughter agreed she signed with merrill accounting firm

the recruiting process and the skills ernst &amp young seeks students will be told they can email the information to parents who ask questions "our candidates and our interns increasingly look more and more to their parents when theyre making career decisions " says dan black director of campus recruiting for the americas ernst &amp young is mulling other ways to reach parents in brazil the firm hosted well received parent intern receptions u s recruiters are considering adopting that tactic among others mr black says recruiters and colleges say that while parents should guide and counsel their children about job hunting it is important that parents let the youngsters make the phone calls themselves whether it is to inquire about a job application or to negotiate an offer recruiters also note that sometimes the children are embarrassed when parents get overinvolved vanguard in recent years has noticed many calls from parents inquiring about how their children can apply or trying to negotiate the terms of a childs offer karen fox vanguards manager of college relations and recruiting says she initially wasnt sure what to make of it ultimately she says "we started to say well how can we embrace it " so this academic year recruiters started asking some successful applicants if they would like a letter sent to their parents as well the letter provides information about the company and lists the web site this proved tricky as well some students bristled at the suggestion that their parents should be involved now vanguard asks students if there is anyone with whom they would like to share news of their offers most say yes "as much as they involve their parents they still want to be treated as independent and as adults " ms fox says "in the end theyre going to ask us to send it to their parents but you have to treat them as professionals " online today theory &amp practice is a weekly look at people and ideas influencing managers send comments to theorypractice
