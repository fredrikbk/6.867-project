notes from baghdad baghdad the new strategy to secure baghdad has been dubbed by prime minister nouri al maliki as "operation imposing the law " after weeks of waiting and anxiety it is finally underway and early signs are encouraging the government information campaign and the news about thousands of additional troops coming had a positive impact even before the operation started commanders and lieutenants of various militant groups abandoned their positions in baghdad and in some cases fled the country diyala province to the east of baghdad was the destination for many sunni extremists while shiite militiamen went to babil and diwaniya in the south some higher ranking members of shiite and sunni militant groups fled to iran and syria respectively this migration motivated the government to announce supporting security measures in five provinces around baghdad to make sure that fleeing bad guys do not regroup in other cities this indicates that both the addition of more troops and the tough words of prime minister maliki are doing the job of intimidating the militants the extremists understand only the language of power and any reluctance or softness on the part of the iraqi or u s government would only embolden them in this way the clearly voiced commitment of president bush and prime minister maliki was exactly the type of strong message that needed to be sent one difference between this and earlier failed attempts to secure baghdad is the willingness of the iraqi and u s governments to commit enough resources for enough time to make it work another important point is the insistence of the iraqi government that political factions not interfere with the progress of military action the commanders and the prime minister have made it clear that no one will be above the law and that even places of worship and the offices of politicians will be subject to searches and raids if evidence of involvement in violence is found the iraqi commanders are also trying to give the operation a national stamp by including troops from across the country even from kurdistan and far provinces like basra where politicians and officers have been long opposed to being involved in baghdad yet another aspect that makes "imposing law" unique is its ascending intensity unlike other operations that always started from a peak and soon lost momentum this plan is becoming stricter and gaining momentum by the day as more troops pour into the city allowing for a better implementation of the "clear and hold" strategy people here always want the "hold" part to materialize and feel safe when they go out and find the army and police maintaining their posts the bad guys cant intimidate as long as the troops are staying the iraqi people themselves are playing their role in the plan recent figures from u s officers in baghdad show that the joint forces have been receiving an average of security tips from civilians since the beginning of the operation about twice previous figures with help from a government appointed committee people in some baghdad neighborhoods are returning occupied mosques to their original keepers and worshippers and holding joint prayers between the two sects in mixed neighborhoods so after only a couple weeks we can feel despite the continuing violence that much has been accomplished many baghdadis feel hopeful again about the future and the fear of civil war is slowly being replaced by optimism that peace might one day return to this city this change in mood is something huge by itself the brightest image of the past two weeks was the scene of displaced families returning home more than a thousand families are back to their homes under the protection of the army and police this figure invites hope that baghdad will restore its social ethnic and religious mosaic marketplaces are seeing more activity and stores that were long shuttered are reopening including even some liquor stores that came under vicious attacks in the past this is a sign that extremists no longer can intimidate people and hold the city hostage all of this gives the sense that law is being imposed checkpoints are not seen as scary threats to the innocent they look more professional and impartial as they include members of the police army multinational forces and even traffic cops with laptops verifying registration papers weve lost the fear that checkpoints might be traps set by death squads they search everyone even official convoys and ambulances we feel safer about moving in the city now and politicians who used to hide behind the walls of the green zone are venturing out watching mr maliki walking on palestine street in central baghdad gave a positive impression that the state and not the gangs owns the streets it is true that not all of baghdad has seen the same amount of progress but we realize that patience is necessary people do not complain about delays at checkpoints but instead say theyd like to see stricter inspection military wise the results are not humble either hundreds of militants have been killed more hundreds arrested and dozens of weapons caches discovered and destroyed the frequency of attacks has declined drastically and the terrifying scene of bullet riddled bodies has become a rarer incident our people want to see this effort succeed we know its not going to be an easy fight rescuing all of baghdads districts from the grip of militants and terrorists will require sacrifice and hard work we hope the troops and the governments in baghdad and america do not lose their resolve mohammed and omar fadhil write a blog iraqthemodel com from baghdad
