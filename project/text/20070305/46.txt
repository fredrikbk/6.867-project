monthly mutual funds review in search of long streaks year after year fund winners are scarce but data mining unearths notable runs winning streaks are tough to achieve in the mutual funds business but for investors they are instructive as well as a lot of fun to follow for years the gold standard of winning streaks was set by legg mason value trust manager bill miller his annual outperformance of the standard &amp poors stock index however ended on dec after years so now that mr miller is out of the picture whose record can mutual fund investors admire to answer that question we asked morningstar inc to help spot some other impressive runs among the thousands of funds out there first we searched among mr millers peers the many diversified u s large company stock funds that for so long were in his shadow that turned up seven funds tied for top honors though at eight years apiece those streaks are barely half mr millers we then screened for other measures of outperformance which funds have landed in the top quartile first third or first half of their peer group in every calendar year for the past decade how about funds that have beaten stock indexes other than the s&amp p say small cap funds that year after year have topped the russell index past performance is no guarantee of future returns as prospectuses like to remind investors also focusing on beating the s&amp p or other indexes year after year means that investors could miss out on top notch funds that hit an occasional rough patch "im skeptical of looking at year to year performance " says morningstar analyst christine benz who adds that one measure of quality is "the extent to which a manager will stick with the strategy even when its out of favor with the market " as ms benz notes "the best managers often follow up weak performance periods with stellar returns " so we also identified funds that have beaten the s&amp p cumulatively for the past years of them some of which endured wild swings over the years in the end many of our data runs produced skimpy numbers of funds reflecting why many small investors have turned to funds that track indexes bypassing stock pickers altogether here are some of our findings in the wings no more the seven "large blend" mutual funds that now boast the longest active streaks of topping the s&amp p are american funds fundamental investors cambiar opportunity goldman sachs growth strategy hartford capital appreciation hls manning &amp napier problend max t rowe price spectrum growth and target growth allocation morningstar identifies large blend funds as those that mostly hold shares in companies with market capitalization of more than &# billion and that buy all sorts of stocks from bargain priced "value" shares to those of companies with rapidly expanding earnings so called growth stocks of the seven the manning &amp napier advisors inc fund topped the index by the widest margin last year up compared with the indexs total return including reinvested dividends averaging each of these funds returns over the past decade the top performer is hartford capital appreciation hls up a year on average next best is american funds fundamental investors with an annualized return "we dont manage the fund with the objective of trying to beat the benchmark " says drew taylor a vice president at capital research &amp management cos which oversees the american funds the objective instead is to deliver "over long periods of time current income and growth to shareholders " investment pros say the streaks arent longer because was such a tough year for the money management industry fewer than one in six u s stock and stock and bond funds beat the s&amp p that year as the index surged to a total return on the back of a tiny number of technology and other go go stocks beyond the s&amp p the s&amp p measures the performance of big companies but many mutual funds are more fairly benchmarked against another measure so morningstar ran screens comparing funds with other widely regarded indexes as it turned out the winning streaks didnt get any longer they still dont cross the watershed year of morningstar started this series of data runs by pitting its large blend category of funds against the russell index which russell investment group promotes as a comprehensive "barometer for the large cap segment " the russell proved to be tougher to beat than the s&amp p just five of the seven funds that have topped the s&amp p since also topped the russell each year not making the cut were the manning &amp napier and goldman sachs funds in the russell returned another fund that beat the russell for eight straight years russell lifepoints equity growth strategy which splits its money among russell investment group stock funds "i dont think one index is significantly better than the other one " brian barish president of cambiar investors llc says of the s&amp p and russell he notes that the s&amp p "has a more large cap growth bias " which can make it harder to beat when growth stocks generally are doing well of "midcap blend" funds the longest active streak against the s&amp p midcap is seven years according to morningstar the record is held by fidelity select defense &amp aerospace up in more than double the indexs return morningstar defines midcap stocks as those with market value between &# billion and &# billion among "small blend" funds the record for longest outperformance of the russell small stock index is seven years held by blackrock small cap value equity portfolio the fund which is closed to new investors returned last year compared with the indexs growth spurts morningstar found five funds in the "large growth" category that beat the russell growth index over each of the past eight years amana growth american funds growth fund of america american funds new economy fidelity capital appreciation and vanguard morgan growth the indexs total return for was in compiling its growth and value indexes russell each year looks at ratios of companies book value to share price as well as their forecasted long term growth amana growths record including a gain in is "all the more impressive" because it is a niche fund for muslim investors with "significant portfolio restrictions based on islamic law " notes morningstar analyst david kathman the fund cant hold stocks that get more than of revenue from goods or activities that are forbidden in the islamic faith including alcohol tobacco pork gambling pornography or lending money the portfolios manager nick kaiser says the fund uses sharia or islamic law to screen about stocks which eliminates about half right away the fund which returned last year has large holdings in technology and health care he says morningstar found another eight year winning record in its "small growth" category there turner emerging growth began its streak against the russell growth index with a return in the best in a single year of any fund on morningstars eight year streak list the fund which is closed to new investors returned last year besting the indexs total return value judgments stock funds in morningstars "value" category had a harder time than many others beating their benchmark indexes the longest active streak for beating a russell value index is all of three years why is it so hard to make a habit of beating the value indexes which russell compiles by comparing book value to share price "its easier for a portfolio manager to hold a stock that has done very well than it is to hold cheaper stocks that have a higher potential of financial distress " suggests silvio tarca lead portfolio manager of j p morgan intrepid value one of the few value funds identified by morningstar with a three year winning streak it returned last year ahead of the russell value indexs total return dws dreman small cap value part of the dws scudder fund family cq won out over the russell value index for three straight years the fund which is closed to new investors "looks for the market overreaction" to buy stocks cheaply says fund co manager mark roach co manager cliff hoover observes that it was "fairly easy" for small cap managers to beat the russell value index for a while but in the past few years it has become much tougher the funds victory over the index last year was the narrowest of the past three years compared with in its return was nearly double the indexs total return top of their class we asked morningstar to find stock funds that finished in the top quartile for each of the past years it was a very short list zero we kept lowering the bar which funds finished in the top third for each of the past years still none finally a run of funds in the top half of their category yielded some winners there were two dfa u s large cap value iii in the u s large value category and american funds growth fund of america in the u s large growth stock fund category the dfa fund part of the dimensional fund advisors lp family ended in the th percentile and the american funds offering spent and in the th percentile last year those funds returned and respectively the dfa managers believe that the riskier companies produce higher returns as compensation says dfa vice president weston wellington "when value stocks have done well its probably going to be the case that the deepest most value y stocks have done the best " he surmises "were getting that value premium and other people arent " so what was so tough about the year the funds return barely made it into the top half of its peers "growth stocks were shooting the lights out " mr wellington says value stocks werent doing as well and "when value stocks arent doing well deep value y stocks tend to do the worst " staying positive through t rowe price capital appreciation did just what the name advertised it racked up a year streak of positive annual returns thats the longest period any stock or balanced fund those holding both stocks and bonds has gone without an annual return in the red according to morningstar the funds goal is to earn a stock like return with low volatility says steve boesel a t rowe price group inc vice president he says the fund maintains a significant exposure to convertible bonds which are debt securities that convert into stock under specified circumstances the preference is for securities "where we dont think theres a whole lot of downside " morningstar identified stock and balanced funds with positive return streaks of between years and years given the steep u s bear market of not losing money is a bigger accomplishment than it may sound initially the bear market helps explain why a majority of the funds on morningstars top performance list in this category are conservative allocation or moderate allocation funds meaning they hold a mix of stocks bonds and cash among these vanguard lifestrategy income and permanent portfolio each with years of positive returns a conservative allocation fund a logical choice for someone approaching retirement might have a mere of its money in stocks one of the longest positive return streaks years is claimed by a different creature entirely gabelli abc a midcap blend stock fund regina pitaro a managing director at the funds parent company gamco investors inc says the gabelli abc fund always has been conservatively run by investing the majority of its assets in the targets of merger and acquisition deals the fund buys the shares after a deal is announced when the share price is still below the deal price because of the risk that the transaction might not go through the fund profits if the deal does close and the shares have risen to match the deal price the fund also often holds a lot of cash also sporting
