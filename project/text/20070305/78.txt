slow pace of consolidation may handicap japan tokyo as waves of consolidation have swept across industries around the globe corporate japan has sometimes seemed to resist the tide while many competitors elsewhere have gone on the hunt for acquisitions to extend their global reach many japanese companies have remained reluctant to become predators indeed some have gone on the defensive hoping to avoid becoming prey that raises the prospect that as global competition intensifies japanese companies could get left behind in the not so distant future they might end up too small to compete effectively against bulked up foreign rivals to be sure there have been some big merger and acquisition deals in japan lately last year japan tobacco inc agreed to pay nearly &# billion for britains gallaher group plc and toshiba corp bought control of westinghouse electric co even so the total value of japanese acquisitions fell last year to &# billion from &# billion in according to dealogic and it was modest even in comparison with the &# billion in deals done in spain a much smaller economy the japanese have remained relatively cautious players in global deal making their forays abroad have shown little of the boldness of indian steel mogul lakshmi mittals relentless pursuit of luxembourgs arcelor sa or his countryman ratan tatas successful offer for anglo dutch steelmaker corus group plc that has prompted some economists to warn that japanese companies arent moving quickly enough to expand "they are supporting each other and using traditional methods to defend themselves " says masaaki kanno head of economic research at jpmorgan securities in tokyo "but is that the best policy " such concerns come at a time when japans economic strength is uncertain its economic growth averaged in last years second and third quarters although it bounced back strongly in the fourth quarter and the outlook for capital spending was recently revised lower domestic demand which accounts for about two thirds of japans gross domestic product has been stubbornly soft while its service sector remains underdeveloped leaving economic growth particularly dependent on industrial production and exports japanese companies failure to bulk up like their global peers is especially pronounced among the countrys steelmakers which have largely been sitting out their industrys rapid global consolidation rather than pursuing more aggressive deals they have considered exchanging limited blocks of shares with one another largely to avert hostile foreign takeovers "the japanese dont care about being big they care about being taken over " says wilbur ross a big investor in steel companies "if i was a japanese company i would be worried about the chinese but their poison pill is the government of japan " which can informally or otherwise help to block hostile takeovers japans steelmakers have commanding market shares but that could quickly change for example in europe japanese steel executives say arcelor gets most of the orders from transplanted japanese auto makers in asia posco of korea and chinas bao shan iron &amp steel are flexing their muscles posco is in the midst of a multibillion dollar investment in orissa india to obtain cheap iron ore bao shan is quickly climbing the value ladder producing higher quality steel and as an encore to their big european acquisitions indian steelmakers may be looking for deals closer to home "i am afraid that mittals next target may be an asian company with advanced technology " says eiji hayashida senior vice president of jfe holdings one of japans largest steelmakers japanese executives say bigger isnt necessarily better they also question whether there is real synergy when giant steelmakers merge rather than standing still some japanese companies have adopted a three pronged approach first they are continuing to move ever higher up the value chain at jfe for example of output goes to high end products also after decades of neglecting shareholders they are focusing on getting share prices up to keep their costs of capital low finally they are forming or considering strategic alliances with one another and with neighbors jfe has close shareholding and technical ties with other japanese steelmakers it also has a joint venture with chinas guangzhou iron &amp steel in which it holds a stake that venture will cater to japanese auto makers such as honda and toyota with factories in southern china as well as local auto makers there mr hayashida adds in january jfe announced it was considering expanding its ties with hyundai steel of south korea it isnt clear whether the steelmakers and other japanese companies are moving rapidly enough "europe has already consolidated " says shigeki makino a senior portfolio manager at putnam investments in boston "the u s is consolidating for the moment they are still all right but much of what they are doing is simply restoring the cross shareholding system rather than moving forward "
