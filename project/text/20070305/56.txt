north korea climbdown washingtons most important person the anonymous senior official "aso" was busy last week briefing reporters on north koreas uranium enrichment program the norths pursuit of nuclear weapons through uranium enrichment an alternative to reprocessing plutonium from spent fuel at the yongbyon reactor constituted both a material breach of the agreed framework and an enormous challenge to the hope that it could ever be negotiated out of pursuing nuclear weapons based however on one public comment and much work by mr ms aso the media last week set about deconstructing a critical strategic concern underlying bush administration korea policy according to their breathless reporting yet another threat to america was disappearing revealed as simply more intelligence hype from an administration that apparently did little else in its first term the reports raise three separate issues first what exactly is the intelligence judgment about north koreas enrichment activities and how valid was it in second what are the implications for the administrations ongoing negotiations with north korea and third is mr ms aso speaking for the bush administration or for those elements in the permanent bureaucracy that have consistently opposed key elements of the bush foreign policy at least as conducted until recently on the first question concerning north koreas enrichment activities there is actually less here than meets the eye the only attributable public comment is from joseph detrani mission manager for north korea for the director of national intelligence who said that he now had a "mid confidence level" about north koreas program down from "high confidence " mr detranis testimony before the senate armed services committee recounted how in october the u s confronted pyongyang "with information they were acquiring material sufficient for a production scale capability of enriching uranium " and how north korea "admitted to having such a program " mr detrani continued "weve never walked away from that issue " indeed in intelligence community officials told me that new evidence erased existing long standing disagreements within the community about what the north was up to since the mid s producing a remarkable consensus that has not to my knowledge broken down since neither in mr detranis testimony nor in any of mr ms asos backgrounding is there any reversal on actual facts only an apparent shift in the "confidence level " my understanding is that the decrease in confidence stems from the absence of significant new or contemporary information about north koreas activities this lack of new information may be attributable to a loss of sensitive sources and methods or it may be attributable to the effectiveness of president bushs proliferation security initiative or its creative financial sanctions in drying up north koreas procurement activity but there has been no suggestion that the intelligence from and earlier has been contradicted or discredited mr detranis testimony is expressly to the contrary indeed on saturday he reiterated this precise point in a second public statement moreover as donald rumsfeld likes to say "the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence " if we lack new intelligence analysts should say so explicitly and policy makers can draw appropriate conclusions one of which might well be that the north is simply better at concealing its clandestine nuclear activities not that those activities dont exist what analysts should not do is to cast doubt on earlier intelligence or change confidence levels if there are no other reasons to do so in any event there is nothing here to allow anyone to conclude that the intelligence conclusions were flawed or hyped this raises the second issue mr ms asos backgrounding is really about the ongoing six party talks and less about what happened in in any arms control negotiation the need for verification is directly correlated to the propensity of the other side to lie cheat and conceal its undesirable activities in the present case the greater the likelihood that north korea will make commitments it has absolutely no intention of following the more intrusive and pervasive should be the verification mechanism we insist on determining in this or any other case how invasive the verification process must be obviously depends in large part on the historical record north koreas aggressive mendacity puts it near the top of the list perhaps tied with iran for the lead of countries that need the most transparent most intrusive most pervasive verification systems for america to agree to anything less would be to make our national security and that of close friends and allies like japan dependent on north koreas word never a safe bet and yet it is precisely this extensive verification system that the north cannot accept because the transparency we must require would threaten the very rock of domestic oppression on which the north korean regime rests north koreas negotiators understand this contradiction so do ours the only way around this problem is to conclude it doesnt exist or is so minimal it can be "fixed" in negotiations thats why mr ms aso was busy laying the foundation to argue that further deals with north korea do not require much if any verification beyond what little the international atomic energy agency can provide if we continue this approach what is already a bad deal will become a dangerous deal whether we make it with north korea directly or in the six party talks as nick eberstadt has put it a bad agreement with six parties is no better than a bad agreement with two parties and that brings us to the third issue where exactly is the administration headed mr ms asos identity is by definition unknown but the view is spreading that this backgrounding is more than the bureaucracys ruminations i have my own unnamed senior officials who tell me its not so but the question remains president bush himself must speak and sooner rather than later to tell us what he thinks of the intelligence and the direction of his own policy recent polls show his approval rating near with support among republicans falling precipitously if the presidents conservative base erodes further where will his support come from from liberal editorialists enthusing about his newfound foreign policy "pragmatism" based on my personal experience the president will not have both mr bolton is a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute and the author of "surrender is not an option defending america at the u n and abroad " forthcoming this fall from simon &amp schuster see related letter "letters to the editor bully for bolton " wsj march
