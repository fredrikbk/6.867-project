the two contrasting views of what happened vicious hit or thing that happens in a physical game he then reviews the contentious history between the two teams and turns to the postgame comments of coaches mike krzyzewski and roy williams which started out polite and then turned less so mr wetzels take "while i agree krzyzewski is correct that hendersons arm motion was not aggressive the replays show the ball he presumptively was trying to block was well out of the way " he writes "so while it is believable that henderson wasnt trying to bust anyones nose with the way he jumped into the fray he certainly wasnt trying to not bust anyones nose what was going to happen it seemed was going to happen if he hadnt connected with hansbroughs nose it would have been just an over the line tough foul &lt ndash&gt the kind that happens often but to flat out excuse it as just part of the game is a bit much it was almost close enough to reasonably shrug off but since it wasnt you cant " on espn com pat forde wonders whats become of the blue devils "this is clearly the worst blue devils team since krzyzewskis dark period in the mid s when back trouble chased him off the sideline for part of the season " he writes "long one of the prettiest offensive teams in college basketball duke now is slow sloppy and lacking create your own shot scorers it has more turnovers than assists has not proved capable of strafing teams from the perimeter as usual and doesnt get enough back to the basket scoring from its big men thats why the blue devils are and just in acc play and thats why theyre starting the acc tournament as a no seed a stunning tumble from dukes normal spot at or very near the top " elsewhere in the college ranks joakim noah and taurean green scored points each as no florida finished a perfect season at home beating kentucky the wildcats sixth straight loss to the gators had the new york times karen crouse pondering transitions "there was no formal passing of the baton sunday just a warm handshake at midcourt between billy donovan and tubby smith " she writes adding that "donovan got his coaching start in at kentucky as a low level assistant on a staff that included smith who became the head coach eight years later smith won a national championship in his first season in by following a blueprint that was as familiar to kentucky fans as bluegrass in recent years donovan has turned florida into a program that has eclipsed kentucky as the envy of the southeastern conference " in the louisville courier journal eric crawford writes that wildcat fans "are crazy but theyre not blind and heres what they see a program that used to be the one to dispatch opponents into irrelevance is now sitting in the background yesterdays game at florida wasnt about uk it was about whether the gators would get their groove back the wildcats arent the show they used to be the show they used to be the ones cracking confident smiles with a big lead before the game was over they used to be the ones running away with the southeastern conference championship but yesterday uk was little more than a foil for the florida drama will the defending national champions regain their swagger they did " creightons ticket to the big dance came courtesy of no southern illinois beaten by the bluejays in a upset on espn com mark schlabach breaks down the bluejays blueprint

end of nearly every season " he asks "go to omaha neb the midwestern city best known for its beef where creighton university has done what so many small colleges would like to do beef up its program so it can compete with any team in the country " these days college stardom means a road not taken in the washington post mike wise focuses on two maryland seniors mike jones and d j strawberry who combined for points saturday as the terps beat north carolina state mr wise remembers the two playing high school games against lebron james in and ponders the divergent paths taken by mr james nba stardom and the two terps "they came here four years ago stayed and finally thrived " mr wise writes "their blue chip counterpart four years later i dont know who lebron is other than a too serious very rich and extremely talented young man i do have an idea who strawberry and jones might be what they might have experienced and how they might have grown since they came to campus in except for lebrons nba all star peers there is no equity in most of his relationships he is king james the unabridged version and they are his serfs thats no disrespect thats just his reality people who equate happiness with living ridiculously large admire and envy lebrons existence think he indeed has it all well rounded souls who have gone the route of jones and strawberry know better " the fix had to laugh at the back page of todays new york daily news carl pitches and lives thats how its gone for the new york yankees carl pavano whos endured injuries and skepticism about those injuries from his teammates front office and yankee fans angry at a talented very well paid pitcher whose last big league appearance came on june given all that two ok innings in a grapefruit league game counted as progress "pavano answered questions in the clubhouse for about five minutes some of them with his mouth full as he ate a granola bar " john harper writes in the daily news "an oprah moment it wasnt yet he offered just enough of a peek behind the curtain to get a sense of the demons he has had to overcome after nearly two years of injuries at times in fact he sounded almost like a recovering addict of some kind speaking of not giving in to thoughts of injury the way a drug user might speak of fighting the urge to get high " stanley jefferson was once a yankee and a new york met but injuries derailed what many thought would be an all star career mr jefferson became a new york city police officer and was on duty on sept in the daily news wayne coffey writes about what happened
