politics &amp economics bush poised to counter chavez trip to latin america could find u s president on defensive president bush travels to latin america this week to take on hugo chavezs militant brand of economic populism but the weakened u s president could spend much of the trip defending against charges his own economic policies have helped shortchange the region in a speech in washington today mr bush is expected to lay out a central theme of his latin america tour that democracy is key to improving life for the millions of working poor in the region as an example he is expected to cite the millennium challenge account a u s government sponsored program set up in to channel aid to poor countries that meet certain democratic standards during his trip which begins thursday he also is expected to tout an agreement with brazil to spread production of ethanol throughout the region as a way of promoting greater prosperity and countering the influence of venezuelan president chavezs oil wealth mr bushs message seeks to respond to widespread complaints in the region that globalization and international development policies of which he is viewed by many there as a main champion have done little to improve the lives of ordinary people there the president also hopes to use the democracy theme to push back against what he views as mr chavezs authoritarian tendencies mr bush wont venture into any countries that have moved into mr chavezs sphere of influence including argentina bolivia ecuador and nicaragua instead he plans during his weeklong trip to visit five generally friendly countries brazil uruguay colombia guatemala and mexico mr chavez and his allies are preparing a typical street theater response to mr bushs visit argentinas president nestor kirchner has invited mr chavez to a public demonstration most likely in buenos aires that probably will coincide with mr bushs visit to neighboring uruguay at the end of the week mr chavez has also been talking up confrontation with mr bush on his daily radio program he has alleged that mr bush will use his latest trip to weaken the south american common market known as mercosur that mr chavez wants to use to promote trade and investment ties among members and to counteract u s dominance in the region besides venezuela mercosurs members include brazil argentina uruguay and paraguay in brazil labor unions and social groups plan protests against mr bush demonstrations are likely in venezuela and elsewhere in the region mr chavez has his own problems many in latin america view the venezuelan leader as a meddler with militaristic tendencies a regionwide poll taken in december by the latinobarometro firm of santiago chile found that of latin americans viewed both messrs bush and chavez negatively a level of disapproval exceeded among the regions leaders only by cubas fidel castro mr chavezs ally and mentor the prospect of further conflict between messrs bush and chavez threatens to distract from the u s presidents efforts to rebuild ties to the region which have suffered given the u s focus on terrorism and the middle east the most important stop for mr bush may be brazil the largest latin economy where he is scheduled to meet with president luiz inacio lula da silva in sao paulo south americas biggest city mr bush is expected to take a firsthand look at the regions poverty underscoring his concern for economic development mr bush aims to accelerate his drive for alternative fuels by announcing a partnership with brazil to broaden the global market for ethanol the plan envisions production across latin america and the caribbean as well as greater standardization mr da silva is expected to seek lower u s tariffs on brazils sugar based ethanol but prospects of that are slim in congress beyond ethanol mr bush "wants to maintain mr da silva as a mediator in latin america and a counterweight to chavez " said gilberto dupas a specialist in international relations at the university of sao paulo despite brazils strong trade ties and cordial relations with venezuela brazilians blame mr chavez for encouraging bolivian president evo morales to announce the nationalization of the countrys oil industry last year mr bushs next stop uruguay could give him another wedge against mr chavez and mercosur the u s has been seeking a free trade agreement with uruguay and mercosur would have to ease its rules to allow uruguay to remain a member if it strikes a deal with the u s mr bush is expected to get a warm reception in colombia where he is relatively popular that is due largely to plan colombia a u s military and social assistance program started under the clinton administration in guatemala mr bush is expected to toast early benefits of the central american free

set to meet with recently inaugurated mexican leader felipe calderon to discuss such sensitive issues as immigration hoping to nudge u s immigration reform mr calderon introduced a plan tuesday aimed at providing better treatment to the central americans who come through mexicos southern border analysts said mr calderon is likely to use the initiative to show that progress can be made on bilateral
