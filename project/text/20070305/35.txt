in wartime kitchens dinner was sculpted from grains and paste will you eat beans for democracy " asked the new york city league of women voters in the spring of as it wound up its know your onions campaign and launched a know your soy beans drive at the time shortly after the u s entered world war ii americans didnt have much choice about beans and democracy unlike today every american felt the consequences of war with supply channels cut off and the armys bottomless appetite for food and other essentials the government was starting a mandatory rationing program limiting access to basic foods such as sugar cheese butter canned goods coffee and most painful for a carnivorous nation red meat steaks roasts and chops long the centerpieces of the american dinner table would be supplanted by legumes and other novel sources of protein "there is only one favorable comment to make on the meat situation " announced a newspaper food writer in late "pork feet and knuckles are fairly plentiful and comparatively cheap " one of the first foods to be rationed was sugar each person got a half pound or about one cup a week per capita consumption of all sweeteners now is about four cups a week soon the sugarless sweet became the holy grail of americas "soldiers in house dresses " sugar was hoarded for special occasions "and members of a family would put their sugar together to bake wedding cakes or holiday cookies " wrote joanne lamb hayes in "grandmas wartime kitchen " ordinary desserts were more likely to be salvage pudding using cake and cookie crumbs or bread tarts within months many other foods joined the ration list and amateur and professional cooks were forced to invent a whole new cuisine ration book gastronomy although ration amounts varied monthly depending on supplies a general rule of thumb was that every person was entitled to ration coupons for a total of two and a half pounds a week of red meat cheese and butter and oils which they could allocate as they liked poultry and fish were not rationed and worse cuts of meat and internal organs cost fewer points "it takes longer to bring a calf into the world than to build a cruiser " explained daniel p woolley new yorks commissioner of markets the patriots in the kitchen did the war effort proud they invented sausage cornuts sausage and corn flakes california "chicken" potatoes peas and canned tuna and bologna with ginger snap sauce for emergency steak they were told to mix a cup of wheat cereal and a pound of ground beef and "pat into the shape of a t bone steak " the word "mock" appeared frequently in wartime recipes there was mock pate de foie gras made with beef liver and horseradish mock fish cakes flavored with bloater paste mock veal cutlets made of peas and salted peanuts and mock goose lentils with "stuffing " a turkey could be made of meatloaf the legs formed by wrapping ground meat around clothespins butter was sorely missed and butterless butter made from milk mayonnaise margarine and gelatin didnt quite cut the mustard another butter substitute was peanut butter recommended for adding flavor to a white sauce for boiled cabbage americans per capita butter consumption dropped from pounds a year in the s to pounds in as dire as the situation sometimes seemed in america with long lines winding through grocery stores in some european countries it was worse between and food imports to great britain were nearly halved britons like americans were urged to cultivate victory gardens eat more vegetables and leave nothing on their plates "those who have the will to win cook potatoes in their skin " went one government slogan no bananas mash some parsnip and flavor it with a little banana essence restaurants and other commercial food businesses in the u s received more generous rations than individual households but they still struggled with shortages gene cavallero chef at the colony restaurant in new york city developed a "luncheon concoction" called celery cheese which involved boiling celery leaves and tops covering them with thin slices of cream cheese sprinkling with cinnamon and baking at the restaurant mayan in rockefeller center customers could order broiled honeycomb tripe with a thick mustard sauce or lung stew with apple dumplings a chinese grocer recommended heart chop suey not surprisingly a brisk black market in food quickly developed with sellers charging more cash and fewer points for precious items hoarding was also common a california woman told her local ration board that she had accumulated cans of food before canned goods were rationed "most american consumers have followed the normal american disposition to try to beat any control " said a spokesman for the american institute of food distribution "we are not sufficiently war minded to feel that we should absolutely obey government orders as a patriotic service " tell that to the people who were dining on cottage cheese fondue squash biscuits or
