everything from the wages it pays to its role in homogenizing american culture but while its growth in the u s is slowing wal mart is striking gold south of the border largely free from all the criticism like wal mart fans in less affluent parts of america most shoppers in developing countries are much more concerned about the cost of medicine and microwaves than the cultural incursions of a

and it still attracts customers from hours away wal mart bet on mexico just as the country was opening to global trade after mexicos devastating currency crash and economic collapse in sears roebuck &amp co and former rival kmart both pulled up stakes but wal mart stuck it out carrefour sa a key global rival for wal mart pulled out in after failing to gain share in an increasingly competitive market in mexico wal mart has been a counterweight to the powers that control commerce one of the most closed economies in the world until the late s mexico was dominated for decades by a handful of big grocers and retailers all were members of a national retailing association called antad and cutthroat competition was taboo at the local level towns are still hostage to local bosses known here as caciques the indian word for local strongmen who control politics and commerce wal marts jobs pay well by mexican standards and serve as a gateway to the state health and pension systems full time jobs with regular salaries are scarce about half mexicos labor force million people work in a so called informal economy of day laborers unregistered taxi drivers and street vendors their salaries are in cash and they pay no taxes because they arent in the tax system they are also not eligible for the state run health care system and government mortgage subsidies and they have no pensions in a country where family connections often matter more than skill wal mart trains floor workers to rise to management plus wal mart lowered prices on thousands of staples from tomatoes to diapers helping stretch low wages here for millions of middle class and poor consumers the retailer entered mexico in teaming up with local retailer cifra sa when wal mart started to publish price comparisons showing how much cheaper its prices were other retailers were outraged in wal mex was forced to resign from antad then rivals were forced to improve service and keep up with price cuts to stay in business in january alone wal mart cut prices on items some in mexico arent happy with the fact that wal mart now accounts for half of the countrys entire supermarket sales mexicos beloved open air food markets where hawkers buff up the fruit and offer tasty sample slices have been hit hard over the past few years local shopkeepers have teamed up with leftist intellectuals to try to block the construction of new wal marts in several places "when the small business owner goes out of business the middle class gets smaller " says sebastian alvarez a year old liquor store owner who is part of a group in the tourist mecca of los cabos at the southern tip of the baja california peninsula seeking to block a wal mart though opposition is small today he said he expects criticism of wal mart to grow in coming years just as it did over time in the u s for now however such efforts have been largely unsuccessful global exchange a san francisco based antiglobalization group is advising mr alvarez and others in los cabos who want to prevent wal mart from entering baja california sur the only mexican state without a wal mart store the group figured it might sway the towns new left wing mayor luis diaz a member of a political party that opposes free trade but mr diaz is welcoming the american retailer "i can understand that some businesses might be hurt by wal mart but the fact is that the people here want it it increases the purchasing power of people with very little money " mr diaz says in an interview wal marts success among the poor of mexico has made it something of a hero with politicians here compare how wal marts applications to move into banking were received in the u s and in mexico north of the border labor unions and banks have all but killed the plan u s federal reserve chairman ben bernanke raised concerns about regulating a combined lender and retailer in contrast mexicos central banker guillermo ortiz is a wal mart fan once crediting its price cutting with helping control inflation in the years after mexicos currency collapse mr ortiz and other regulators hope wal mart will change mexican banking which is dominated by a few foreign owned financial firms that cater mainly to the wealthy wal mart got its mexican banking license quickly and branches of its adelante bank which means "forward" in spanish are set to open this year wal marts success in mexico is on display in juchitan a sun soaked desert village of residents near southern oaxaca states pacific coast the town a hotbed of left wing politics fought off the aztecs the spanish and the invading french over the centuries many people here still prefer to speak zapotec rather than spanish when wal mart started to build one of its "bodega aurrera" stores austere versions of the super center designed to meet small town needs a scattering of marchers gathered on a few days to protest that the new store would put local merchants out of business and harm the local culture but the protests died out because most people wanted the store the first big national retailer to venture in in juchitan as in other small mexican towns consumer goods often cost far more than in cities partly because of transport costs but wal marts huge fleet of trucks and computerized logistics allow it to sell a microwave at the same price in juchitan as in mexico city to do it wal mart squeezes out overhead even more aggressively in its small town stores the floors of the bodega store are concrete which requires a smaller cleaning staff in recent months as rising prices for u s corn pushed up the price of mexicos corn tortilla a staple for millions of poor wal mart could keep tortilla prices largely steady because of its long term contracts with corn flour suppliers the crisis turned into free advertising for wal mart as new shoppers lined up for the cheaper tortillas wal mart also overcame a juchitan cacique or local boss hector matus a trained doctor who goes by la garnacha the name for a fried tortilla snack popular in town dr matus owns six pharmacies stationery stores and general stores he has also held an array of political posts including juchitan mayor and state health minister as town mayor from to he says he blocked a national medical testing chain from opening in town because it meant low price competition to local businessmen doing blood work but dr matus couldnt persuade local and state officials to block wal mart and he is feeling the pinch sales are off at his stores since wal mart arrived and he is now lowering prices in response even so hes still more expensive a box of losec stomach medicine costs pesos &# at one of dr matuss stores marked down from pesos the price at wal mart is pesos &# dr matus isnt happy about the competition "i could still kick them out of town because i know how to mobilize people " he said sitting in his living room surrounded by pictures of himself with leading mexican politicians dating back to the s despite his bravado town officials say wal mart is staying "the ones who have benefited the most from wal mart are the poorest " says feliciano santiago the deputy mayor "i hope another one comes " when wal mart opened its doors here it tried hard to fit in it found zapotec speaking interviewers to put applicants at ease at the morning sales meeting here the obligatory wal mart cheer is shouted in zapotec "gimme a w " is "dane na ti w " product announcements are broadcast in zapotec by saleswomen in traditional flowing skirts and ornate blouses shoppers hear the strident trumpets and cymbal clashes of local tunes called sones de tehuantepec in mexican towns like juchitan shopping at a wal mart is a high end experience the air conditioning and lights are on across town at an outdoor market flies swarm on buckets of shrimp and fish piled on counters without ice let alone refrigeration gisela lopez the year old head of billing at the juchitan store benefited from the retailers system of promoting from within raised by her uneducated zapotec speaking grandparents ms lopez earned a computer degree at juchitans small technical college and then left for the booming northern city of monterrey in search of opportunity lacking connections she couldnt find the office job she dreamed about and took a job at one of wal marts stores after three months ms lopez made cashier supervisor and later moved over to the billing department when wal mart opened a store in juchitan ms lopez jumped at the chance to move home and was promoted to billing chief in the process "its a very different place to work because you can succeed by your own effort " says ms lopez whose &# a year salary now puts her in mexicos middle class ms lopezs story of economic mobility is a rare one most of her childhood friends dont have steady jobs she said the success stories are friends who inherited jobs from their parents at the state oil companys big refinery in salina cruz about an hour away
