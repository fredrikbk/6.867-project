brewing conflict ethiopia battles starbucks over rights to coffee names chains image rattled by trademark spat hints of chocolate rum fero ethiopia starbucks corp s top coffee buyer journeyed to this hilltop village a year ago to thank farmers for creating what he calls the worlds best coffee delighted growers wearing ceremonial animal skins lined up to greet him and then danced and performed an elaborate coffee pouring ritual "i looked everyone in the eye and shook their hand and said thank you for giving us this wonderful product " recalls dub hay the starbucks executive "its one of the more special things ive ever experienced " within months though the celebration dissolved into feuding that has rattled starbuckss image the worlds largest coffee chain is locked in a trademark dispute with ethiopia one of the worlds poorest countries the battle was spurred by a rare aggressive attempt by a developing country to assert intellectual property rights ethiopia which starbucks trumpets as the birthplace of coffee is seeking to trademark the names of its most famous coffee regions sidamo harar and yirgacheffe which appear on the packaging of starbucks and other coffee roasters the country aims to gain more control over the distribution and promotion of its most valuable export and ultimately secure a better price for farmers the growers in fero which is in the sidamo region receive about cents a pound for their coffee starbucks has sold the processed product for as much as &# a half pound "for us the issue became how do we address this unfair price gap how do we ensure that the poor farmers get a reasonable return " says getachew mengistie the director general of ethiopias intellectual property office starbucks spent months discouraging ethiopia from trying to trademark the names while the company has recently retreated from that it refuses to sign a royalty free trademark licensing agreement offered by ethiopia starbucks executives say the agreement is legally onerous and believe it would place too much responsibility on the company to defend ethiopias trademark "its not something you would do as a business " says mr hay senior vice president of coffee and global procurement for starbucks as the dispute has percolated ethiopian officials and the local media have accused starbucks of "coffee colonialism " farmers feel betrayed "if anyone should have the trademark it should be us " says tilahun garsamo chairman of the fero farmers cooperative which has more than members they live in mud brick houses and tend by hand the coffee plants that grow on their small plots of land a number of families in the cooperative depend on food aid to combat malnutrition "our name " says mr garsamo "is the most important thing we have " social advocacy groups that once heralded starbuckss coffee buying practices have turned against the coffee giant critics say the company refuses to support ethiopias trademark effort because that could open the door for other countries to do the same thing adding a layer of cost that could raise the prices starbucks pays starbucks buys virtually all its coffee from foreign countries mostly from latin america it buys about from ethiopia "their immediate focus is on their profit margins " says adam kanzer managing director at domini social investments which manages &# billion including shares of starbucks he phoned the company last year to voice his concern that starbuckss stand is inconsistent with the companys socially responsible heritage "this is part of the real value of the company from an investment perspective " mr kanzer says starbucks executives say the issue isnt about money they say they want to help farmers earn more but dont think trademarking is the right way to go about it starbucks has argued that ethiopia should instead try to win "geographic certifications" a different legal method that other coffee growing regions have used to build the reputations of their regional names last year starbucks bought of its coffee from "fair trade" certified co ops which guarantee farmers a minimum price starbucks bought of its coffee from sellers who adhered to guidelines that the company established to promote economic sustainability for farmers starbucks says its guidelines are more comprehensive than the fair trade standards if ethiopia can secure trademark rights it hopes to issue licenses to distributors around the world ethiopia says it wouldnt charge for licenses but would require the licensees to work to expand the market for its coffee "the more our coffee is known the more demand will grow as demand grows price grows and there will be more money for the farmers " says mr mengistie starbucks executives however say that if ethiopia wants to increase the value of its regional coffee names the best way is to allow starbucks to freely promote them in its nearly stores around the world "we want them to have full marketing power if you will and i dont think any company today does it better than starbucks " says starbucks chief executive jim donald touting the exotic appeal of specialty coffees from around the world is part of starbuckss strategy to give customers a sense of discovery inside stores for years starbucks has put pictures and stories about coffee farmers on its packaging recently it started designing some stores using bright colors and bamboo touches to evoke the feel of its coffee growing countries in starbuckss coffee buyers went to the fero co op in the sidamo region of ethiopia and asked growers to experiment with a new method of drying beans starbucks said it would buy the beans regardless of how they turned out the first batch flopped and starbucks bought and discarded nearly pounds the next year starbucks instructed the growers to pick only perfectly ripe coffee cherries then thinly spread them in the sun to dry in the co op sent starbucks its second batch at starbucks headquarters in seattle mr hay sipped the coffee from the sidamo region "ive never tasted anything like this " he recalls saying as hints of black cherry chocolate and dark rum crossed his palate mr hay designated the coffee for starbuckss black apron exclusives line reserved for its highest priced beans the co op was rewarded with a &# bonus in coming up with a name starbucks asked farmers from fero what the word for "partnership" is in the local language the farmers discussed it "shirkina " they finally said starbucks dubbed the coffee "shirkina sun dried sidamo" after the region where it was grown even with a price tag of &# a half pound it sold out in eight weeks in ethiopia meanwhile the notion of trademarking coffee names was gaining ground the country established its first intellectual properties office in as a tool for economic development mr mengistie saw that ethiopian coffee names had great value in western countries where the coffee sold for high prices ethiopia which claims to have pioneered the coffee trade more than years ago also worried about the future according to the world bank ethiopias coffee exports in the fiscal year ended june totaled &# million which was about of the countrys total exports but because of low prices some farmers have begun pulling up coffee plants and replacing them with khat a plant whose leaves and stems produce a mild stimulant when chewed khat fetches three times the price of coffee and can be harvested three times a year coffee has only one season "is saving specialty coffees like sidamo and assuring supply not in the interest of starbucks and other companies " asks mr mengistie who often climbs eight flights of stairs to his office in the capital of addis ababa because the elevators stall "the intent is to build a market where both starbucks and the farmers gain " in march the ethiopian government applied for three trademarks in the u s for names of its coffee growing regions a few months later the u s patent and trademark office blocked ethiopias application for "sidamo" because starbucks had already applied to trademark the name "shirkina sun dried sidamo " the ethiopians say they were astonished "it is rude and selfish of a company to take the name of its partner " says mr garsamo the fero co op chairman mr hay says the company only wanted to keep competitors from stealing the word "shirkina " but was required to submit the entire name of that coffee to secure the trademark starbucks never intended to take ownership of the word "sidamo " he says other countries including canada japan and the european union have granted ethiopia trademarks for some of its regional names in march the u s trademark office awarded ethiopia a trademark for yirgacheffe the name of one of its coffee regions three months later the national coffee association a u s trade group sent a letter to the trademark office urging it to deny ethiopia trademarks for sidamo and harar the association argued that they are generic names robert nelson the groups chief executive said "ethiopia doesnt have the capacity to manage the trademarks " ethiopia produces about of the coffee imported in the u s as measured by dollar value according to the u s department of agriculture starbuckss mr hay is chairman of the coffee associations government affairs committee he says mr nelson filed the protest without consulting his committee and that starbucks didnt ask the group to try to block the trademarks in july after the coffee association filed its objection starbucks withdrew its trademark application for shirkina sun dried sidamo but after the trade groups protest the u s trademark office provisionally refused ethiopias request for sidamo and harar ethiopia is now appealing that decision what might have remained a little noticed bureaucratic dispute became an international affair when oxfam a nonprofit relief and development group began publicizing it in the fall it urged customers to send cards to starbucks complaining about the companys stance and it posted a video on youtube com challenging starbucks to honor commitments to poor farmers starbucks executives were taken aback by the criticism "it flies in the face of everything we do " says dennis macray a director in starbuckss corporate social responsibility department since starbucks says it has spent &# million on social projects in ethiopia executives say they became concerned the trademark issue could erode the social goodwill they had built into starbuckss brand but still starbucks hoped it could persuade ethiopia to change course because its lawyers thought ethiopia was pursuing the wrong path rather than seeking trademarks starbucks told ethiopia it should try to win "geographic certifications" for its regional names a method that guatemala colombia and other countries have applied to coffee names that ensures the coffee came from the region where the packaging says it was grown none of the countries starbucks buys from have trademarked their coffee names mr hay says starbucks began coaching its baristas to tell customers that starbucks is a positive force in ethiopia and it posted its own video on youtube featuring mr hay insisting that starbucks already pays premium prices to ethiopias farmers in november mr donald the starbucks ceo flew to ethiopia and laid out his position to prime minister meles zenawi the ethiopian leader said he would be happy to work through any business concerns but declared ethiopia wouldnt give up its trademark quest mr donald left without signing a licensing agreement on that trip messrs donald and hay climbed into an suv and trundled over a rocky road to reach the fero co op they applauded the farmers for growing a second batch of shirkina beans "congratulations on producing the worlds best coffee for starbucks " mr hay wrote in the co ops guest book "fantastic " wrote mr donald starbucks says last year it paid an average of &# a pound for its specialty coffees or above the average price of coffee on the commodity market starbucks doesnt buy this lower grade coffee the company declined to detail how the price it pays compares with what other specialty coffee companies pay starbucks defends the gap between the price it pays for raw coffee and the price it charges in stores among other things starbucks pays to transport store and insure the coffee as much as of the beans are lost in roasting "were not really apologizing for the profit margins because what we do with that margin is open new stores " mr hay says "the gift that starbucks can bring to the coffee farmer is the guarantee of more business next year " the farmers of fero say the best gift would be better prices for their crop they ended up with about cents per pound of dried beans according to co op officials after further processing and transporting the sidamo coffee farmers cooperative union in addis ababa says it sold tons of shirkina beans to starbucks for &# per pound last month mr hay returned to ethiopia to deliver the keynote speech at an african coffee convention local journalists grilled him on why the company was against the trademarks one government minister threatened to ban starbucks from the country during the visit mr hay says he and others realized ethiopia wasnt going to back down after the trip starbucks promised to double its coffee purchases from east africa and increase technical support to farmers there it also changed its position and said it would stop discouraging ethiopia from trying to get the trademarks "starbucks respects the right and choice of the government of ethiopia to trademark its coffee brands " the company said in a news release starbucks however still wont sign the licensing agreement with ethiopia to get around the issue starbucks has yanked the name "sidamo" off the coffee it created with farmers in fero the company renamed it "ethiopia sun dried shirkina "
