kim jong ils word north korean officials arrived in new york over the weekend for discussions on normalizing relations with the u s as part of the nuclear disarmament accord struck last month chief u s negotiator christopher hill is scheduled to meet today and tomorrow with his counterpart vice foreign minister kim kye gwan may we suggest that before he sits down mr hill take a look at the brief statement issued quietly thursday by the united nations development program undp there is no better guide to kim jong ils negotiating style nor to the north korean dictators habit of breaking his word nuclear negotiators beware the agency announced in an item on its web site that it is suspending all operations in north korea because the "necessary conditions set out by the executive board on january have not been met " the undps or so projects will be shut down were told and its eight international staffers will be pulled out of the country the u n isnt known for its tough love and no one weve talked to can recall another example of the undp suspending operations in a country that refused to comply with the regulations the "necessary conditions" were imposed at the last board meeting in response to an outcry over the undps lack of oversight over its programs in north korea u n documents produced reluctantly after prodding by the u s mission to the u n showed numerous irregularities dating back into the late s tens of millions of dollars for programs that were supposed to help the poor appear instead to have been handed over to kims dictatorship as the march deadline for compliance approached north korea decided to throw a tantrum to see if it could get excused from its obligations it deemed the conditions politically motivated especially the one that limits aid to programs that directly help the people and bans assistance that could aid the government and demanded a renegotiation never mind that north korea sits on the executive board and had agreed to abide by the terms thrashed out in january to its credit the undp refused to be bullied into extending the deadline and is holding pyongyang to its commitments the suspension applies to all existing projects the board had already suspended new projects until an audit could be completed and better oversight provided the u n has another deadline fast approaching in north korea at the end of january secretary general ban ki moon ordered a full investigation of all u n programs in north korea to be completed within three months those include unicef the world food program and the u n population fund as the end of april deadline for that audit comes closer it will be instructive to watch pyongyangs degree of cooperation meanwhile the talks on north koreas nuclear program are moving ahead with the u s south korea and japan all holding bilateral meetings with pyongyang this month toward the goal of normalizing relations at the top of japans agenda is the whereabouts of its citizens who were kidnapped by north korean agents in the late s and s and forced to train north korean spies negotiations with pyongyang have so far yielded the return of only five abductees along with preposterous explanations for how the rest have supposedly died the preference in some diplomatic circles including the u s state department and perhaps now in the white house is to dismiss the u n corruption in north korea as well as the abductee and other human rights violations as side issues to the more vital objective of getting kim to give up his nuclear program wed argue that international focus on these issues is an essential part of keeping up the pressure on kims regime but even if you buy the argument that these are ancillary issues theres still an important lesson here if kim wont abide by the pledges he made regarding undp aid to his country how can he be expected to keep his promises on nuclear disarmament former u s ambassador to the u n john bolton lays out the troubling case of changing american intelligence judgments toward north korea on the opposite page his point about the need for an intrusive inspection and verification regime is especially important under the six party agreement announced on february north korea has days to account for all of its nuclear programs if it doesnt or if kim attempts to renegotiate the terms at the last minute wed like to think the u s would show at least as much fortitude as the united nations and tell kim to take a hike
