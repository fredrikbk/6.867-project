why advertisings cavemen are going totally hollyrock is finding a way for marketers to beat commercial zapping dvrs and helping networks to cure the distressed state of tv comedy so simple that a caveman could do it abcs decision last week to greenlight a half hour pilot program based on geicos popular cavemen characters highlights the blurring line between advertising and entertainment as well as the trouble the network has had in launching successful sitcoms although the project is at a nascent stage theres no script and no cast plans call for the comedy to be titled "cavemen" and focus on a trio of prehistoric characters who battle prejudice in modern day atlanta walt disney co s abc will pay for the pilot and show if one eventually materializes geico a unit of berkshire hathaway inc will have no creative control but will receive a royalty payment for the use of the character "we sell car insurance we dont make tv shows " says ted ward geicos vice president of marketing "we are excited to have an opportunity to do brand extension " while marketers have long depended heavily on so called product placement where products are written into the story line of a show some are now going even further by creating entertainment programming that subtly reminds viewers of a brand name "its about delivering to them something they want to see and not interrupting them " says doug scott executive director of branded content and entertainment at wpp groups ogilvy &amp mather north america in many ways the trend harkens back to early tv when shows like "colgate comedy hour" were produced or sponsored by advertisers one of the most aggressive has been burger king holdings inc the chain has focused over the last year on lifting the profile of its "king" mascot a mute character best known for his creepy smile the burger baron recently starred in a series of videogames and the company says it has lined up a studio and distributor for a feature film russ klein burger kings president of global marketing strategy wont reveal the studios identity or the likely plot but he says the movie could appear as early as the end of this year with the film aimed at "creating a back story for the king " geico introduced the cavemen characters three years ago initially in an ad promoting geicos web site that used the slogan "its so easy to use geico com even a caveman could do it " the ad became popular and a series of sequels followed mostly centered on the idea of cavemen being offended by the insensitive slogan of the first commercial the characters have achieved celebrity status thanks in part to geicos enormous ad budget the insurer spent an estimated &# million on ad time and space in according to tns media intelligence an amount expected to be up last year although final data arent available geico receives hundreds of letters and emails about the characters and fans at college sporting events have been known to hold up signs that say "beating team name is so easy even a caveman can do it " more recently the caveman has been showing up outside ads eight days ago an actor dressed as a caveman showed up at the academy awards and attended an after oscars bash last month the caveman played a round of golf with football analyst phil simms during his super bowl pregame show on cbs corp s cbs the five segments totaled about three minutes the deal was part of an ad package that horizon media geicos media buying firm cooked up with cbs that also included running cavemen ads during the networks hours long run up to the national football league championship these appearances were part of a strategy by geico and the ad agency that crafted the cavemen spots interpublic groups martin agency to move the character beyond commercials like many other marketers the insurer recognizes that the deluge of ads on television and digital video recorders that allow viewers to skip commercials means traditional ads arent as effective as in the past "as a marketer you have to look for new and unusual ways to get your brand out there because of large amount of messaging clutter and media fragmentation " says geicos mr ward the initiative for the cavemen pilot came from joe lawson the writer behind the cavemen commercials and a martin agency employee who decided in late fall to pursue a tv show with geicos approval the ad firm hired entertainment services agency management to shop the idea to networks although reaction was mixed nbc for instance says it passed the concept allowed abc a chance to address a set of persistent challenges while achieving enormous success with the dramas "greys anatomy" and "desperate housewives " the network has for years failed to launch a successful sitcom in "cavemen " executives saw a funny idea with a built in marketing hook a spokeswoman for the abc television studio which will produce the pilot said no executive would speak about the project because "its way too premature to comment " she cautioned that there is no guarantee "cavemen" will result in a prime time show abc has ordered other comedy pilots for the television season and will likely give the green light to fewer than five for full fledged series production much remains uncertain it isnt clear whether abc would use the three little known actors who have starred in the ads the three are identified by a person close to the agency as jeff daniel phillips ben weber and john lehr its also not clear whether geico would continue to use the cavemen ads if the series was to get off the ground although abc would see that as a positive according to a person familiar with the networks thinking as the ads would help promote the show the road to hollywood isnt without potholes for advertisers cbs in tried building a sitcom around a talking baby popularized in a commercial for an internet company "baby bob" lasted only five months still some ad characters have had some success the california raisins which appeared in ads for the california raisin board were a pop culture hit in the s the clay animated figures best known for an ad where they sing and dance to "i heard it through the grapevine " starred in a tv special and had a short lived cartoon series on cbs if the cavemen series does make it to air it will leave in the dust geicos famed green gecko which is in many ways more popular than the cavemen but has no spinoff in the works says geicos mr ward "evidently the gecko doesnt have the right agent "
