americas castros gulag like thousands of other cubans i was arrested in the middle of the night fidel castros police raided my parents home stuck a machine gun in my face and took me away it was and i was years old the news that the cuban dictator is gravely ill floods my mind with memories of my years spent in captivity i believe that those of us who were political prisoners know his legacy better than anyone for years i was an inmate in his vast prison system mostly confined to an island gulag for crimes i did not commit like the majority of cubans in i cheered castros victory over fulgencio batista a dictator on friendly terms with the u s castro called himself the enemy of all dictatorships he had a cross hanging round his neck and he swore that there would be free and fair elections but as his near five decades of uninterrupted power proved he tricked everyone and replaced the dictatorship of batista with his own bloodier version in a famous appearance on "meet the press " castro answered a question put to him by lawrence spivak "democracy is my ideal really i am not communist there is no doubt for me between democracy and communism " once castro began making his sympathies overt i began speaking out against his ideological shift amongst the people in my workplace the postal savings bank at the time the government was distributing placards with the slogan "if fidel is a communist then put me on the list hes got the right idea " the phrase was ubiquitous from decals to billboards when officials in the bank demanded that i put the slogan on my worktable i refused when they asked if i had anything against fidel i told them that if he was a communist then yes i did i had no desire to become a symbol of political dissidence that decision was made for me that day thirteen days after my arrest i was tried on charges of threatening the powers of state security even though there was no evidence against me the justice system under castro was a mockery of the rule of law members of my tribunal were communist party apparatchiks who sat with their boots up on tables smoking cigars and reading comic books their very presence was but a formality the verdicts had already been decided i was not permitted an attorney i received a year prison sentence as a potential conspirator two men in the same court room falsely accused of shooting at a government spokesman were executed by firing squad when their defense attorney whom they had met just minutes before pleaded with the prosecutor to reduce the sentence the prosecutor responded that he had received orders to have them shot no matter what as a means of social prophylaxis once in prison if the guards felt like punishing us they would put us in cages with mesh roofs and walk along the edge while pouring buckets of urine and excrement all over our bodies sometimes guards would shoot prisoners for target practice that is how they killed alfredo carrion and diosdado aquit many of the men whom castro had imprisoned tortured and killed had been his comrades in overthrowing batista but most of them were innocent people eliminated in ernesto "che" guevaras psychotic quest for what he and castro called the "new man " the impunity of castros dictatorship was marked by its cruelty a prisoner in my block julio tan once refused an order by a prison guard to dig weeds the guard struck him with his bayonet another hit him with a hoe and a gang of guards beat him until he bled to death in just a matter of minutes my friend pedro luis boitel a student leader and courageous opponent of batista went on a hunger strike in to protest his treatment on the th day of the strike castro personally ordered that boitel be denied drinking water boitel died of thirst in horrific agony five days later terror was castros main tool the tactics used for enemies of the regime included the exploitation of phobias such as reptiles and rats the use of drugs so as to have prisoners lose all notion of time and place blindfolding prisoners hanging them by their feet and then lowering them into wells they were told are filled with crocodiles the use of guard dogs that had their teeth removed and which were set upon prisoners with hands tied behind their backs usually these dogs attacked the genitals first all of this was investigated and extensively documented by a visiting delegation from the united nations the evidence can be found in geneva the legacy of castro for cuba will be much like that of stalin in russia pol pot and ieng sari in cambodia and hitler in germany it will be the memories of the unknown numbers of victims of concentration camps torture murder exile families torn apart death tears and blood castro will go down in history as one of the cruelest of all dictators a man who tormented his own people but his poisonous legacy will also include the double standard by foreign governments intellectuals and journalists who fought ferociously against the unspeakable violations of human rights by right wing dictatorships yet applauded castro to this day many of these intellectuals serve as apologists and accomplices in the subjugation of the cuban people rafael correa the recently inaugurated president of ecuador has declared that in cuba there is no dictatorship evo morales president of bolivia considers castro his mentor and has already shown that he is willing to silence his own critics at the point of a gun venezuela once a democracy is the new cuba replete with a growing population of political prisoners castro hemmed and hawed in the early s concealing his ideological allegiance to the most murderous system of government humanity has ever experienced todays latin american caudillos openly express their allegiance to communist ideals "i am very much of trotskys line the permanent revolution " venezuelan president hugo chavez said in january if we have learned anything from fidel castro it is that the totalitarian impulse outlives even its most hardened and ruinous practitioners mr valladares former u s ambassador to the u n commission on human rights is chairman of the new york based human rights foundation and author of "against all hope a memoir of life in castros gulag" national book network
