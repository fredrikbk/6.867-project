novartis angers critics in india challenge of patent laws creates uproar among public health advocates when charitable groups accused novartis ag of jeopardizing the supply of inexpensive medicine to poor countries late last year the swiss drug giant thought it could swiftly win over its critics instead the fight is only gathering momentum with world leaders and politicians jumping in to rebuke the company novartis set off alarm bells after india rejected its patent filing for the cancer drug gleevec novartis has requested several patents in india and gleevec which is patented in countries including china was the first to be rejected novartis sued to challenge indias decision in court in chennai and filed a separate suit in the court saying that india needed to loosen its laws to make it easier to patent drugs india a big maker of generic medicines supplied to many poor countries established its current patent law in to fulfill its obligations as a member of the world trade organization critics say the changes in indian law sought by novartis would make it harder for poor people to get inexpensive medicines for hiv and other diseases led by doctors without borders novartiss critics have staged protests outside the companys offices in washington brussels and boston and collected signatures from nearly a quarter of a million people in countries in an attempt to get novartis to abandon its court case novartis officials say they are concerned about the damage the campaign is causing the companys reputation "we didnt quite expect the uproar weve had " says paul herrling head of corporate research at novartis who says he has met with the group to defend novartis the dispute underscores the growing tension between public health interests and intellectual property rights that friction has been particularly difficult for india as it attempts to develop into a more sophisticated economy with all the benefits and obligations of wto membership until indian law allowed domestic companies to sell copies of drugs that were patented in the west as long as they changed the process by which the drugs are made charitable groups and developing nations rely on indias cheaper generic versions of the latest treatments for hiv and other diseases in early india adopted a new patent law that lets drug companies seek patents on medicines invented after the year india joined the wto or for new and more efficacious versions of older drugs so far india has granted about patents under its new law one of the first went to roche holding ag for a hepatitis c treatment india says it rejected novartiss application for a gleevec patent because the form of the drug novartis wanted to patent wasnt "more efficacious" than older versions of the drug novartiss lawsuit says the criteria india used violate wto rules and should be removed from indian law generic companies in india sell copies of gleevec a treatment for rare cancers including chronic myeloid leukemia or cml winning a patent for gleevec wouldnt enable novartis to stop them because india law allows existing generics to remain on the market and novartis based in basel switzerland says it gives the drug away to about patients in india because few can afford the official gleevec price of &# a month but novartis wanted patents for gleevec and other drugs because it believed that indias growing middle class would increasingly be able to pay for brand name medicines novartis made a case of gleevec because it was the first to be rejected says thomas wellauer head of corporate services and a member of the executive committee at novartis "if the patent law in india stays the way it is it is very difficult to patent new drugs " mr wellauer says though indias pharmaceutical market is growing fast patented drugs account for about of the indian markets &# billion in sales sales are expected to climb to &# billion by with the share of patented drugs growing to about according to a report from consultants ernst &amp young several months after novartis filed suit in august relief organization oxfam international asked its supporters to email novartis chief executive daniel vasella to complain novartis says it received more than emails novartiss public affairs office emailed a response to the oxfam campaigners telling them "that our case in india is about gaining clarity and strengthening the indian patent system which will ultimately help patients and societies " the max foundation a leukemia support group based in edmonds wash and partly funded by novartis defended the drug company in february it began collecting more than signatures from uninsured low income patients around the world who receive free gleevec from the company the foundation posted the signatures on its web site pat garcia gonzalez executive director of the max foundation says novartis didnt ask for its help and that the foundation collected the signatures of its own accord but the pressure kept building doctors without borders and other groups organized protests outside novartis offices around the world and posted films of the events on their web sites desmond tutu the south african nobel peace prize winner known for his work against apartheid and aids signed the doctors without borders petition legislators in the european union and u s also wrote open letters to dr vasella urging him to drop the case hiv activists have been particularly critical of novartis saying its efforts could bring a return to the s when new hiv drugs were patented and expensive and few generics were available for patients in poor countries any changes to indias patent law could make it easier for drug companies to patent minor improvements in hiv drugs making it harder for poor patients to receive these medicines doctors without borders says novartis says this isnt a concern because wto rules allow countries to produce cheap copies of drugs they urgently need for a public health crisis whether the drugs are patented or not novartiss case puts indian drug companies in a delicate spot many oppose novartiss efforts to strengthen patent laws but some including ranbaxy laboratories ltd and dr reddys laboratories ltd are trying to patent brand name drugs themselves ramesh adige executive director of ranbaxy in gurgoan outside new delhi says incremental innovation should be patentable in india so long as "frivolous inventions" arent given patent protection drug fight indian patent law and the novartis case  world trade organization rules that oblige developing countries to grant
