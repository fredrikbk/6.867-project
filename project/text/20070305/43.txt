monthly mutual funds review fund fiend investor stress test can you tolerate more market jolts mutual fund investors still smarting from last weeks market declines might chalk it up to the cost of an education tuition wasnt cheap the dow jones industrial averages point plunge on tuesday driven by losses in shanghai and worries about the global economy was jarring the benchmark was down more than points at one stage and selling was so furious that the indexs fall wasnt tracked correctly the day had a sky is falling feeling for a little while there with a point drop friday the index closed its worst week in over four years while not nearly a record loss in percentage terms tuesdays fall was a blow nonetheless partly because it came after such a halcyon period in the markets and the fund world the average u s stock fund has made money in each of the past four calendar years averaging a annual gain over that stretch the average stock fund had just one down quarter per year the most painful was a loss in last years second quarter about the same as the dow industrials loss on tuesday prior to last weeks jitters the pros were struggling to figure out why things had been so calm for so long it was a happy confluence of rising corporate profits and low interest rates that led to this "long steady run up " according to andreas utermann london based global chief investment officer at rcm a unit of allianz se one problem with the lack of volatility he says is that it creates "a prevailing sense that the financial markets are not as risky as they used to be and some people will be surprised" when volatility ticks up that is a good reason for fund investors to take a hard look at what they own and whether they can live with more steep losses at least some fund investors have taken on more risk in recent years sharply higher cash flows into foreign stock funds seemed reasonable given the vast u s bias of most investors portfolios but a significant chunk of that money went into high flying emerging markets funds many of those funds lost far more than the u s markets did last week at the same time persistently low yields overall enticed some investors to favor riskier bond funds it would probably be a mistake to assume that volatility will continue to be as low as it has been the combination of growing demand from emerging markets like china and the lower cost products and services offered in these markets has helped buoy the global economy and keep inflation in check the flip side however is that a growing chunk of the global economy depends on developing markets that will inevitably have fits and starts that rattle u s markets hopefully this crash course for investors is nearly finished please send comments to ian mcdonald wsj com
