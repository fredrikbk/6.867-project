theyre all f trains when confronted with a february report detailing how new york citys taxes are the nations highest mayor michael bloomberg replied that new yorkers pay more because well they get more "given the level of services that the public wants we just have to have money to pay for things " he said new yorkers who suffered long delays on the subways last friday due to a little rain may be wondering where all of that money goes the city badly needs to beef up its investments in the public transportation system as well as better manage those investments as new york grows more crowded by the day and subway ridership increases up since and at the highest level in years conditions are dismal day after day people wait deep to get on the escalators to enter stations on manhattans east side then wait again in standing room only crowds to exit through dangerous floor to ceiling turnstiles in brooklyn a borough thats seen more than apartments go up in a decade crowding worsens every week on the l and f lines as more people start their commutes from new buildings in less than perfect conditions the situation becomes downright intolerable when it rains tracks flood and signals malfunction a minute commute turns into an hour much more disturbing nearly six years after and two years after the london subway bombing the system remains dangerously unprotected from terrorists the dollars that flow into the subway system could be put to much better use riders and taxpayers are funding transit worker benefits that simply arent available in the private sector anymore pensions and health care costs consume of operating revenues meanwhile bronx and manhattan commuters are still waiting for a second avenue subway outer borough commuters need new express tracks as well as signal upgrades on existing lines to support more trains and reduce overcrowding and the subway system needs cameras reinforced tunnels and communication upgrades to reduce the risk of attack the federal government has given new york money for this very purpose federal state and local taxpayers as well as riders paying &# fares already foot the bill for more than &# billion a year on capital improvements including big ticket projects like the long awaited second avenue subway sounds like plenty right well not really to see what a low priority mass transit is consider that new york city spends more than &# billion on medicaid annually furthermore much of the subway spending is not for new projects but for core maintenance and replacement of existing assets cars and tracks for example nearly half of that work is funded with debt almost twice as much as in the s and early s as a result within three years more than of subway revenues will go directly toward paying interest and principal twice as much percentage wise as just a couple of years ago and it will only get worse as debt service consumes more of the subway budget fewer dollars will be available for operating tasks like cleaning stations even when the city and state devote money to new projects its just not enough the full cost of the second avenue subway for example is likely to reach &# billion not the less than &# billion allocated over five years and as that project now finally underway after years of stops and starts inevitably costs more than expected and as work inevitably proceeds more slowly than expected the shortfall will only grow vital signal projects begun years ago wont be complete for another years and a modest slate of security improvements including cameras and tunnel reinforcement wont be done until nearly a decade after if things go well mr bloomberg seems unconcerned about overcrowded and vulnerable subways when new york times magazine reporter jonathan mahler asked him last year about overcrowding on the east side line he replied that commuters should wake up earlier if they dont like rush hours to be fair the metropolitan transportation authority accountable to the governor not the mayor runs the system but thats no excuse the fact that the mayor didnt run the citys dysfunctional education department six years ago didnt stop him from taking control to fix problems there if mr bloomberg really wants to create housing and jobs hed invest more of the taxpayer money he controls in the subway and use his representation on the mta board to make sure its spent wisely better subway service to coney island would spur developers to build more quality housing there without taxpayer subsidy conversely decaying assets underground will only retard the growth of new york jobs the mayor doesnt have to wrest control of the mta from the new governor but he does need to be a much more effective advocate for a subway system that so greatly affects new yorkers public safety and quality of life ms gelinas is a contributing editor to the manhattan institutes city journal see related letter "letters to the editor mayor has great plans for new yorks subways" wsj march
