fiscally fit time for time and a half the paycheck is nice but terri wonders is it worth it for gerry to work overtime online edition my husband gerry finds it difficult to turn down the offer of overtime hours and lately its offered a lot at his facilities management job most weeks hes asked to work a few hours a week beyond his regular eight hour days and come in for eight hours on saturday gerry isnt able to work overtime during the week because hes got to pick up our son gerald after school but each saturday he wakes at a m to head to work when we debate whether he should take the weekend overtime gerry always mentions the extra cash "its a &# day how can i turn that down " on summer saturdays gerry has no problem turning it down because theres a clear cost our &# boat sitting unused in a slip we lease for &# a season but if its not summer things arent as clear cut recently gerry asked me to crunch the numbers and figure out in real dollars and cents the boost overtime gives to our bottom line i was happy to do it but i know the issue is more than money turning down overtime is heresy in gerrys family his dad gerald whos retired now but used to work in the same union worked every additional hour offered even though it meant having chaotic overnight and weekend schedules my father in law says all that overtime pay is the reason he was able to retire comfortably at age my mother in law kathy shared the same strong work ethic and when my gerry went to work in the union she urged him to never turn down extra hours nonetheless now and then kathy mentioned to me how her husbands hectic work schedule made it tough to manage their family life and sadly she didnt live long enough to enjoy retirement with him i can relate to her feelings overtime increases our net income but its time gerry spends away from home and that takes its toll our hectic weekday schedules dont often allow us to spend time together and have meaningful conversations because so much of the little time we have together is focused on geralds evening routine as a result i sometimes find myself calling gerry at work in the morning to discuss private matters such as our health or geralds education that we should have discussed the night before at home i also worry about too much work affecting gerrys health he hurt his back a month ago and its been slow to heal because of the many hours of physical labor and its starting to dawn on him that all that overtime may not be worth what hes missing one sunday evening gerry thanked me for the "great day" hed had and all wed done was keep each other company lounging around the house i have my own selfish reasons for wanting gerry to turn down overtime sure not working overtime would give gerald and me more time with him but it would also give me an hour or two for myself when gerrys not around on saturdays i have to drag gerald around town with me running errands its geralds least favorite chore and time he cant spend with his dad or his friends the cost to me stress last week i did my usual saturday errands on sunday when gerry was home and was struck by how much more relaxed i felt there was no urge to rush to get shopping done so gerald could get back home to play and i managed to get more done in less time despite all that gerry was reluctant to give up the extra pay at least until he found out how much he was really making on those saturdays instead of &# he thought he was making the additional days pay at time and a half added &# to his paycheck now factor in taxes gerry pays federal income tax payroll tax and new jersey state income tax for gerry that translates into &# in federal income tax about &# in payroll tax and &# in state income tax so for giving up his saturday gerry gets &# and the government makes off with &# or more than of his earnings gerry argues that overtime doesnt just affect his take home pay it also boosts the amount of money contributed by his employer to his tax deferred annuity this is where gerry overestimated the amount of income he gets from overtime at his regular salary the contribution is &# an hour but at time and a half it jumps to &# an hour in january gerrys overtime boosted the amount of pretax income contributed to his fund by roughly &# a week after years when we hope to retire that &# a week would add up to roughly &# assuming a rate of interest in retirement savings so combining his take home pay and his annuity contributions gerry would be giving up &# a week if he stopped working overtime each saturday and potentially much more in lost earnings on his savings while the idea of handing so much of his saturday earnings to the government made gerry want to stop working overtime its the retirement savings that he found more difficult to give up a few of his coworkers are in their late s and are busy making plans for retirement and all their talk about vacation homes and travel has him thinking a lot about his own retirement and more eager than ever to get there still i reminded gerry about his parents experience and how much his father wishes every day that hed had more time with his wife not working saturdays would give gerry more time to spend with our son gerald time my husband didnt have with his own dad gerald cant stop talking about the heated game of nerf dart tag gerry played with the neighborhood kids and him last sunday arent those kinds of memories worth far more than &# a week in retirement savings after talking it through gerrys decided the overtime isnt worth it still he sometimes feels pressure to work on the weekend because managers deadlines have to be met or because his absence means more work for his colleagues so we agreed to meet in the middle gerry will start turning down overtime when his absence wont prove too great a hardship for his coworkers or his career to make up for the lost income well make spending cuts elsewhere well eat out less often and save on insurance and state fees by finally getting rid of one of our cars is overtime worth your time do you ever feel pressured to work overtime how does working overtime affect your career write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a discussion about balancing work and family life or join me and your fellow readers in a continuing discussion about last weeks column on parents who overschedule their kids with too many extracurricular activities readers overwhelmingly said kids are too busy though some parents argued its the kids who cant say no to an activity kids are overscheduled today and i detest this practice my husband and i both work full time and let our oldest whos in the first grade participate in girl scouts and one sport at a time her classmates seem to have at least three to five extracurricular activities i find this appalling for such young children especially the evening weekday activities no six or seven year old should be taking dance class from p m to p m on a school night or swimming from p m to p m at what time are these kids going to bed rest and some down time are more important than these activities patricia rust it makes no sense to schedule every minute of your childs day whos going to think for them as they move through high school and college its a good idea for kids to learn how to entertain themselves some of the time maybe they will find to time to read a book what a novel concept douglas e hart in answer to your father in laws question "why do you feel the need to keep the child constantly entertained " you have to begin by explaining the competition there are too many other forms of entertainment available with hundreds of tv channels including several that show cartoons all day and night video games mp players and of course the internet we do allow some tv and video games in the house but weve set times where all entertainment devices have to be turned off except one not everyone agrees all the time so not everyone has to participate parents included we find that watching certain movies or tv shows gives us an opportunity to discuss issues at the end of the show even "survivor" has hidden lessons to be learned and even though i cant begin to compete with my son on his video games i understand what hes talking about and can participate in something he is passionate about chris harrison i recall spending many enjoyable days after school just playing ball with the other children in the neighborhood in todays environment this seems to be the exception to the rule in place of this free form play with other children we have formal play dates usually with only one child at a time or many more formal ball teams each under the supervision of adults who may or may not be more enthusiastic about the sport than the children with all of the adult oversight i wonder how children will learn to resolve potential conflicts when no adult is nearby my memory is that many of my lessons about resolving conflicts and being flexible started as a child when we voted on which sport to play that afternoon or when we played monopoly we would take turns being the car maybe the lack of opportunity for free form play is the root cause of the problem or maybe im just getting old and look too fondly upon my childhood joe iannini write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com
