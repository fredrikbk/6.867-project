making connections verizons network bet relies on games tv it hopes to up demand for costly fios system a texas writers role jason henderson a laid back blond author from dallas has made a name for himself by writing the "sword of dracula" horror comic book series as well as several best selling computer games lately the year old has been plying his creative talents at verizon communications inc mr henderson is an unlikely secret weapon for the telecom giant along with a beat up yellow backpack he carries the title of games product manager a job that signals just how far verizon is branching out to score new customers a noted player himself he has so far pushed verizon to invest in a well known game developer helped launch an interactive online gaming web site and created gaming ads to post on the video site youtube "gaming affords a lot of opportunity to grow our network and revenue in new ways " says mr henderson more than ever verizon needs to do just that three years after rolling out one of the industrys costliest initiatives a super fast &# billion fiber optic network the company must now prove that its pricey gamble can pay off in the form of consumer demand the challenge comes at a time when verizon is struggling to compete in a new digital landscape cable operators for instance are busy selling phone service once verizons main business rival at&amp t inc meanwhile is rolling out its own fiber network as well as a tv service and striking deals with internet and satellite companies google inc which owns youtube is entering the internet access business with a wifi network even apple inc has muscled into the telecom field by hooking up with at&amp ts wireless unit to market the iphone verizon executives see the new network called fios as a chance to reposition the telecom giant into more of an internet based company one that can supply a raft of digital services under one roof the plan is to offer a host of new services to run on fios some of which are still in the development stages the company is targeting everything from online games and local news shows to movie downloads and music mixing sites with fioss ability to carry huge amounts of data at warp speed verizon is betting that the network will be a magnet for subscribers and advertisers alike investors however remain generally uneasy about verizons costly fiber initiative even though some think the new content might eventually bring in major revenue such doubts have been reflected somewhat in verizons stock price which over the past year has risen roughly by contrast shares of rival at&amp t which is building a less expensive fiber network that isnt as fast as fios have grown roughly in the same period john santo domingo a portfolio manager at new york hedge fund acero capital management llc says one of the reasons his firm doesnt hold any verizon stock is because it thinks the companys strategy is too risky "its a very capital intensive endeavor theyve undertaken " he says "you dont know what the industry is going to be like by the time fios is fully deployed theres a lot of uncertainty " verizon executives are mindful of the hurdles ahead "were not going to hit a home run" with any one new service or product says robert ingalls verizons executive vice president and chief marketing officer who is helping oversee the initiative "weve got to have hundreds of applications and capabilities " fios replaces copper lines with glass fiber allowing internet traffic to travel significantly faster than on other connections sold by phone companies movies take seconds to download instead of as long as two hours this isnt the first time that u s telecom companies have built networks and later sought to create demand for their expensive systems at the height of the dot com boom in the u s the industry spent some &# billion to lay nationwide fiber optic communications lines for networks that could carry internet traffic over long distances the fiber rush was driven by predictions that internet traffic would skyrocket with no end in sight when those notions fell flat the telecom industry crashed about six years ago leaving a nationwide fiber glut verizons fios network is different in that it is regional stretching from the companys local offices directly into customers homes in select areas of its territory in the northeast california and texas the company currently offers the service to more than six million homes and expects to make fios available to million homes by consumers are starting to catch on since it began hooking up homes to fiber in the company has sold fios subscriptions gaming first appeared on verizons radar about three years ago company research showed that gaming was a leading activity for more than of high speed internet users and with more than million players the market is huge even better for verizon the games are increasingly packed with graphics requiring high capacity connections for fast downloads and smooth game playing exactly what the company says fios was built to handle cable companies such as comcast corp and cablevision systems corp which also offer games downplay the speed of fios "we combine cutting edge design the best content exclusive partnerships and the speeds needed to deliver the complete entertainment experience that is simply better than the competition " says jen maclean comcasts vice president and general manager of games mr ingalls the chief marketing officer had no experience in gaming but his teenage sons did he had bought them gaming consoles and noticed how they were excited to use them to also connect to the internet and play against other gamers across the country "i thought if broadband can enhance that gaming experience then why arent we in it " mr ingalls said he shared his ideas with other executives all of whom knew fios had ample capacity to allow users to quickly download and play the same kinds of multigigabyte online games used with xbox and playstation but manufacturing its own game consoles would be too expensive for verizon instead the company focused on ways to create a fast paced multiplayer experience in a low cost fashion with downloadable games for pcs starting in verizon began offering various gaming options a &# a month on demand service allows subscribers to download an unlimited number of existing games such as bowling mania or dead mans hand on a dedicated web site another service called verizon arcade lets users download single player games such as aquaball and chicken invaders for about &# each about months ago a headhunter matched verizon with mr henderson mr henderson had been intrigued with the work of closely held super computer international inc which creates web portals and other services that power many major gaming companies super computer was working on a browser that could harness private servers to allow numerous users to play internet games with each other on their pc keyboards in may verizon bought a stake in super computer to help finance work on its new interactive gaming web site last fall with super computers help verizon rolled out the site called playlinc the flagship of verizons gaming efforts playlinc is meant to be a one stop shop for online players by downloading the free playlinc software gamers can avoid the steep prices sometimes charged by other services for jousting with far flung players and while they play playlinc enables them to talk to more than friends over an internet phone connection or through instant messaging verizon doesnt develop its own games so it struck deals with publishers to offer several popular titles such as the race car thriller trackmania nations at no cost for now consumers dont have to subscribe to fios to use playlinc the immediate goal at verizon is to prove to playlinc gamers that the service works best with its fast fios network mr henderson has tried to build buzz by dropping in on gaming competitions and wandering into cybercafes to show off playlinc often he chimes in as verizons spokesman on gaming blogs and forums "im just so stoked to finally see playlinc running " mr henderson wrote on one gaming forum last summer some gamers think playlinc is too similar to established browsers such as xfire which has millions of users jay messer a year old online gamer from chattanooga tenn says he likes playlinc because it lets him talk to so many players at one time but he defaults to xfire because all his friends use it "were in the habit of xfire " says mr messer "playlinc is not really catching on " verizon wont say how many gamers currently use playlinc but says it is pleased with early results the company however says it isnt generating much revenue from its gaming efforts it plans to sell banner ads on the browser as well as ads during a second lag while servers are launching verizon hopes that it can lure more gamers to subscribe to its fios service through ads on the playlinc site the company is preaching its game gospel through ads that run on channels such as comedy central recently mr henderson lined up intel corp as a partner to help market playlinc through joint advertisements with the chip maker intel will also work with verizon to sell pc games for use on tv sets just as it is finding its way in the game world verizon is pushing into television too in an attempt to battle cable companies that offer phone service on its turf verizon rolled out a new fiber based tv service called fios tv in the fall of it is now available in states and for the most part carries typical channels found on other cable services verizon has already added more interactive features on fios tv than many cable companies currently offer viewers for example can click through their photo collections on their tv sets or record tv shows in one room and watch them on another set at&amp t is also launching an internet based tv system as part of its own skirmish with cable operators so far though investors have been skeptical about whether the phone companies tv offerings will be different enough from those offered by cable companies to counter those perceptions verizon is creating its own local channels to run on its fios tv that it hopes will help lure customers away from cable one of the channels called fios is set to begin airing soon in the washington d c area verizon says it will include around the clock traffic and weather updates as well as news programs from local affiliates of say abc or nbc aired after they appear on broadcast channels also on its lineup is "push pause " a regional show about local residents one episode features an elderly man in the northern virginia area who lost his eyesight when he was young verizon is negotiating with youtube to air its videos on fios tv a new web portal surround verizon net lets visitors download movie trailers music videos and games and create blogs about entertainment topics not all of its efforts however are so mainstream and that is by design one example its "beatbox mixer" web site which lets users mix and match samples of percussion patterns from hip hop stars but verizon hopes that draws like "beatbox" can attract as wide a range of fios fans as possible to promote the service verizon threw a party at a new york city club last summer verizons future ambitions are on display at the companys new verizon experience stores modeled after apples stores where consumers can test drive various services and products one southlake texas store manager cody dunlap reports that even those unfamiliar with gaming seemed happy to try their hand at a title called diner dash "everyone is a kid at heart i think and gaming is an easy thing for them " says ms dunlap "itll pick up "
