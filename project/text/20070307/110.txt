the doctors office why mandatory vaccine might not be the answer online edition my uninsured year old patient with an abnormal pap smear is getting some difficult news shes carrying hpv a sexually transmitted virus on her skin shes not alone an estimated of the year old female population in the u s carry the virus my patient will harbor it potentially for her lifetime and can pass it to a future partner even if they use condoms she has high risk hpv one of the strains that raises her risk of developing cervical cancer illinois is among about states now considering mandatory vaccination of preteen girls against hpv or the human papillomavirus with a new vaccine from merck &amp co called gardasil the drug protects against four strains of the hpv virus two of which are thought to account for about of cervical cancer cases worldwide but that leaves the vaccine is effective against venereal warts and to me thats its real usefulness with such widespread hpv infection a vaccination plan might seem like a reasonable idea the issue takes on a special significance in our home because we have a year old daughter but while we did conclude that the vaccine is right for our daughter i think the decision to vaccinate a child with this particular vaccine should be made by the patient her parents and their doctor not the state part of my concern turns on just what the vaccine can do would gardasil have prevented my patients abnormal pap smear maybe but maybe not of the many different types of human papillomavirus that are sexually transmitted only of women in a recent study by journal of the american medical association had one of the four strains of virus the vaccine covers then theres the cost &# and three shots in a reluctant teenagers arm in our state according to a commonly cited statistic one in seven illinoisans is on medicaid on wednesday the governor proposed a massive tax increase on businesses to pay for education and health care how much health care can we afford a lot of the costs associated with human papillomavirus are not due to cancer the costs are associated with annual exams and for evaluation of abnormal pap smears the gardasil vaccine isnt going to eliminate the annual pap smear thanks to the development and availability of the low cost pap smear cervical cancer has become a rare disease in the u s newer versions of the test have cut down on false positive results and improved cancer screening despite the fear induced by diagnosis of an abnormal pap smear only a minority of women with high risk hpv ever develop cervical cancer it often takes years to develop and happens mainly to women who dont have access to annual exams ive seen one case of cervical cancer in my practice in nine years and it was treated successfully with surgery too many women still die of cervical cancer however the real problem is lack of access to preventive medical care for low income women and not the lack of a vaccine there are not millions of women in the u s that were going to save with an expensive mass vaccination program the developing world is another story in my practice ive usually had to initiate the conversation about the vaccine no patients have spontaneously asked about it when ive brought it up several parents have mentioned seeing advertisements fathers seem equally interested in getting it for their daughters several of our local hmos cover the vaccine those who have coverage have often opted for the vaccine no one has paid out of pocket for it as for my daughters situation after research and discussion we opted for the vaccine i read through the clinical trial information looking for adverse advents the safety studies are reassuring but had a limited numbers of preteens involved my daughter was one of the first to get the chicken pox vaccine when it came out and we havent had problems with that there are more vaccines added to the recommended lists every year due to the expense of the gardasil vaccine i think mandating it is going too far too soon as a personal choice spending &# of disposable income on a vaccine is one thing mandating a vaccine with limited clinical usefulness at taxpayers expense in a state with a funding crisis is another write to dr benjamin brewer at thedoctorsoffice wsj com
