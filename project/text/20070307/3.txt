a technology writer confronts wizardry in todays hospitals of all the ways for an otherwise perfectly healthy adult to get hospitalized with pneumonia become a senior citizen say or start smoking one of the most effective is the method i used a few weeks back have a run of bad luck one day in mid january i had a cold a few days later something like the flu and a few days after that i was needing three breaths just to finish a sentence an x ray later showed my left lung as flooded as new orleans was for a technology writer to be stuck for days in a hospital st lukes in san francisco there can be a certain make lemonade fortuitousness id be learning about startling technological advances that for a change had little to do with faster microprocessors or bigger disk drives whats more i had read about the hero villain role high technology plays in health care dazzling us with its capabilities but driving costs ever higher now id be living it the superstars of medical technology are the imaging systems like the ct scanner if only because we see their remarkable d and d images on tv hospital dramas like pcs these get better all the time it took seconds for a ct scan to pass over my chest some years ago it would have taken three minutes and the images wouldnt have been nearly as precise says bob senzig chief ct engineer at general electric the company that made my scanner how much better is a ct scan than a prosaic x ray the main symptom of pneumonia is a watery invasion of the lungs however a complication can arise called an effusion in which nasty liquids collect in a part of the lung x rays show everything as a white milky mass but in the ct scan you can see the precise contours of where the lung ends and the effusion begins my radiologist said that before ct scans doctors who suspected an effusion had to hunt for it by inserting long needles into different parts of the patients chest repeating as necessary until they hit some liquid i wanted to kiss my scanner for sparing me that torment a modern hospital is full of many more technology marvels some of which make their reports via a humble print out as they do with any patient with an infection my doctors paid daily attention to my white blood cell counts the machine providing them was the cell dyn sapphire blood analyzer from abbott laboratories one of many unsung heroes in a hospital lab its about the size of a microwave oven and costs about &# the principle behind them is simple because different blood cells have different shapes and surface characteristics they will scatter a laser light thats shined on them in different but predictable ways abbotts harold c flynn says it takes the cell dyn seconds to do an analysis during that time it counts an average of cells and then goes back and does more tests on of them to think that cells once were counted by hand by a lab tech looking through a microscope as for the cost of all this well take a deep breath this is where the conundrum of medical technology becomes apparent the bill for my day stay was &# and that doesnt include any charges from my doctors those ct scans were &# each times the cost of an x ray each white blood cell tally was a relative bargain at &# while this is not the amount my insurance company will end up paying medical accounting rivals hollywoods in its opacity it is still a staggering sum obviously high tech gadgets werent the only reason for the price tag my room for instance was &# a day though a good chunk of that was to pay for a system that used wi fi technology to beam my vital signs to the nursing station health care may be the only field where technology makes things more not less expensive indeed dr mark smith president of california health care foundation a research group says the consensus is that high technology is the leading culprit behind health care taking up an ever larger percentage of our gnp usually he said when technology is added to an enterprise something else is taken away often people but sometimes older and less efficient machines but in health care more often than not new technologies simply join an already crowded party dr smith says its like banks adding networks of atms but keeping their staffs of tellers of course i doubt that i would have declined any of the high tech wonders i was offered who would and that attitude is a main cause of our soaring health care costs the decisions that are in our best interest as individual patients in the aggregate help push things into crisis we cant afford the remarkable system weve been smart enough to build after a week and a half i had all the reasons that any cranky patient would have to want to go home i also had one of my own i wanted to get away from all the medical technology after the hospital the meager tools i had at my house dsl pre n wi fi cat ethernet seemed paleolithic in their simplicity no wonder im feeling better email me at lee gomes wsj com see related letter
