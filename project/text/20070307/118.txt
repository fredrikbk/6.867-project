u s food giants aim for asia children in india dont eat much cereal and canned chicken soup isnt big in china but the largest u s food companies are determined to crack cultural nuances and generations old eating habits to stock asian shelves the draw is huge now that millions of consumers in asia enjoy higher disposable incomes and are willing to spend on western brands but traditional marketing advertising and packaging wont do it instead manufacturers such as kellogg co campbell soup co h j heinz co and general mills inc are pushing greater research and new products and they are even touting some brands as luxury goods to lure their wealthier asian customers such companies profits in the region are still a small part of their overall earnings the asia pacific region as a whole accounts for just about of global sales of food and beverages an acnielsen report found but hopes for a huge payoff down the line are keeping the food giants patient "you just dont see those kind of growth rates in other markets driven by the middle class " said chris warmoth senior vice president of heinz asia heinz says its sales in china india and indonesia are growing at double digit percentage rates and the company expects its emerging markets business to represent &# billion in sales in fiscal historically u s companies have fumbled when entering new markets kellogg learned its lessons in china early on the company built a cereal plant in that country in the early s only to find that cereal didnt resonate sufficiently with the chinese who prefer hot breakfasts the manufacturer closed that plant and now exports cereal to china from thailand things have improved as these companies have spent more time in foreign markets and hired more locals to guide them in china general mills bills its haagen dazs ice cream as a luxury product haagen dazs stores are sit down cafes with ambience and music where customers are greeted at the door and can order from a menu a pint of haagen dazs sells for as much as &# in retail stores well above u s prices "with increased wealth many chinese like to demonstrate their wealth or be seen with luxury brands " said samir behl vice president for international marketing at general mills the company expects its business in greater china will have &# million in sales by the end of this fiscal year for companies getting ready to dip their toes into large foreign markets the preparation can be assiduous campbell soup which plans to begin test marketing its soups in russia and china later this year has been studying soup consumption in those markets for two to three years "we talk to thousands of consumers and we literally sit in their homes with them while they prepare their meals " said chief executive officer douglas conant "we are obsessed with understanding the cultural nuances " one of the biggest challenges the company faces in markets like china is getting consumers to shift to canned soups from homemade preparations campbell isnt disclosing the specifics of its strategy as yet but believes it will be successful "you have to do it in a way that works for the culture because they are not going to just stop and buy a can of campbells chicken soup " mr conant said in much of asia hot homemade meals packed with local specialty ingredients are still the norm that makes the landscape tougher for cereal makers the indian operations of kellogg for instance turned profitable only around more than a decade after the cereal giant first entered the country "in india its all about the higher income earning consumer " said kellogg ceo david mackay that market is now growing well thanks partly to some clever marketing that includes selling cereal in small packets to make the price more accessible to a wider audience
