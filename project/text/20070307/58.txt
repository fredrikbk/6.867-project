relatively speaking holding up well worries over economic growth have hit markets so this phenomenon underlines two fundamental fallouts of sudden market declines shares that have gained most will fall fastest and jittery investors tend to pull their money from smaller markets europe is experiencing this while asian countries arent as strongly because western europe hosts developed stock
