knives out law firms in new era as more corporate defenders take contingency feework payouts risks bring conflict minneapolis law firm faegre &amp benson llp may soon face a problem most firms would be happy to have how to split a &# million plus fee the firm of around lawyers mainly makes its living representing corporations that pay an hourly rate for work but in it agreed to take on a contingency fee case representing more than alaskan fishermen claiming damages from the exxon valdez oil spill that meant faegre would pay the legal costs upfront if its clients won the firm would get a percentage of the potentially huge judgment if not it could lose the money it had sunk into the case the bet appears to have paid off late last year a federal appeals court awarded the valdez plaintiffs &# billion in punitive damages which could yield nearly &# million for faegre and other firms representing plaintiffs in the case in january exxon mobil corp asked for a rehearing but those are granted sparingly now the firm which factors in annual productivity when paying partners may have to wrestle with how to compensate those who produce one whopping sum after years of work traditionally the nations top corporate law firms have shunned contingency fee work often cases that target big corporations for punitive damages for fear of alienating their core clients but driven by pressure to boost profits more such firms are crossing over to what some lawyers call the "dark side " the shift is sparking tensions within big corporate firms besides the financial risks theres a philosophical issue in the debate while it hasnt come up at his own firm david oesting a partner at davis wright tremaine llp which also represented plaintiffs in the exxon valdez case says "you can understand that senior counsel would say punitive damages are sins and the work of the devil so how in the hell could you have been arguing that you should get them " howrey llp in washington sank &# million into representing farmers in an antitrust suit against tobacco companies before the case was settled in generating about &# million in fees for the firm "a partner was going around the firm questioning my sanity at the same time that unbeknownst to him i was negotiating a settlement " partner alan wiseman says "it is hard you are not only dealing with adversaries across the table but you have to manage your partners expectations " a rise in patent litigation is fueling the trend because such cases can result in particularly huge awards law firms are more willing to handle them on a contingency basis "expenses are increasing for firms while at the same time their clients increasingly seek discounts" on lawyers hourly rates says legal consultant ward bower of altman weil inc "the opportunity for upside at many firms is limited and these plaintiffs cases provide enormous upside opportunity " last year wiley rein llp a washington law firm that generally defends large companies earned more than &# million suing research in motion ltd maker of the blackberry for patent infringement on behalf of the small company ntp inc but partner richard wiley says the firm doesnt want to make a "cottage industry" out of these cases "we want to make sure people work on all cases contingent or not and not have associates say i want to work only on contingent cases so i can strike it rich " much of the tension comes from the partnership structure of large law firms lawyers typically bill for their time during economic cycles partners often carry each other financially as downturns affect various practice groups but contingency fee cases bring a new twist the "agrarian plodders" who grind out steady hourly revenues can become distrustful and envious of "riverboat gamblers" within the firm who want to score oversize plaintiffs fees says mr bower especially given that if the case goes for the defense the firm ends up eating costs "if lawyers do really well on a plaintiffs case you can reward them in part but they need to remember that the whole firm accepted the risk " says robert walters a partner at vinson &amp elkins llp in dallas which has a committee charged with vetting prospective contingency cases "and if those lawyers strike out you cant decimate them either you have to spread the risk out across the institution " losses happen last year the kansas city mo firm shook hardy &amp bacon llp lost a contingency fee case after investing five years representing plaintiffs who sued novartis ags gerber products co and playtex products inc claiming they infringed a patent b trent webb head of the firms intellectual property litigation group says the loss wasnt a big financial blow because the firm "ran the case extremely economically " divvying up winnings and dealing with the losses is less of an issue at firms that specialize in plaintiffs work they tend to be smaller with less overhead and fewer mouths to feed than defense firms and they are more apt to let lawyers reap the big payoffs from their own cases bryan cave llp of st louis formed a committee to vet contingency fee cases in some partners were leery considering these cases too "anti establishment " says partner craig s odear but resistance tapered off the next year he says when bryan cave won a &# million plaintiffs verdict in a case on behalf of biomedical systems corp of st louis gerard carmody the lead bryan cave lawyer in the case says he sometimes felt like a marked man "you had people in the corporate department and the banking group who said i dont want to take a chance on carmody spending a year on a case and coming up with a goose egg " he says mr carmody now at carmody macdonald p c a firm co founded by his brother says he thought he was entitled to a big bonus but got only a "little bit of a bump " many partners favored an "all for one and one for all" approach to the fee split he says before exxon valdez faegre &amp benson had done some contingency fee work but nothing comparable in size says gerard nolting one of two faegre partners who has worked on the case since the beginning the firm got involved partly out of deference to partner brian oneill who had a "fire in his belly" to represent the plaintiffs says firm chairman thomas morgan in as the lead lawyer at trial in alaska mr oneill won a verdict that included &# billion in punitive damages after several appeals the th u s circuit court of appeals in san francisco in december ruled exxon mobil must pay &# billion in punitive damages saying "it is time for this protracted litigation to end " an exxon mobil spokesman says the company is hopeful the th circuit will rehear the case so far faegre has collected about &# million in valdez fees due to a partial settlement in on an investment of around &# million says mr oneill that low level of return he says has strained his relationship with some partners mr oneill says his in laws once sat behind two of his colleagues at the symphony who "were complaining about how im wasting money in alaska " if the latest ruling holds mr oneill estimates that faegre could command about &# million in fees firm chairman mr morgan says some lawyers who worked on the case will get a bonus but he wont say how much mr oneill hopes hell get "a big hunk of cash at the end " but he also notes many people may benefit including partners who have never worked on the case "they havent disrupted their lives and missed birthday after birthday they havent been on a plane to alaska on easter sunday " mr oneill says most of the firms partners dont expect a big windfall from the case faegre partner john hinderaker says "im hoping to remodel my kitchen that is the level of expectation i have " big scores examples of plaintiffs
