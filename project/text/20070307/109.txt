the case for a libby pardon yesterday a washington d c jury found former white house aide i lewis "scooter" libby guilty on four out of five counts in his trial for perjury and obstruction of justice this case began when the white house decided to launch a criminal investigation of who told reporter robert novak that valerie plame worked for the cia where she once held non official cover status the constitution gives the president according to the supreme court in u s v nixon the "exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case " but there is another power that the constitution also commits to the presidents unreviewable discretion that is the pardon power and it is just as important an exercise of executive authority while post trial motions or inevitable appeals may eventually overturn the jury verdict there is no need for the president to wait in the unusual circumstances of this case a presidential pardon is appropriate thats because as most people know by now special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald never charged anyone with violating the intelligence identities protection act of the job for which the department of justice appointed him after he quickly determined that there was no violation of that law and it is all but certain that knowing what he knows now the president would never have even started the process after robert novak wrote that valerie plame worked for the cia cia director george tenet requested that the justice department start a criminal probe into the leak of ms plames identity the cia insisted that it was vital to discover the source although robert novak said at the time that the cia "never indicated it would endanger her or anybody else" if he revealed her connection whats more ms plame and her husband reacted to their "outing" in an unusual way they appeared to revel in the publicity i have worked with undercover fbi agents and department of defense officials whose jobs are classified they do not pose for photo spreads in vanity fair unlike ms plame they do not have pictures of themselves in pajamas published in time magazine the final nail in this case should have come when right about the time of mr fitzgeralds appointment former deputy secretary of state richard l armitage told the fbi that he was the primary source who revealed ms plames identity mystery solved the circumstances did not show any violation of the intelligence identities protection act so there could be no indictment but rather than going home mr fitzgerald asked messrs armitage and novak to keep that information quiet he also asked for and received approval to expand his investigation and he kept going like the energizer bunny the whole court case was about memories not about the importance of classified information or whether the government properly classified information in the first place that is because mr fitzgerald never charged anyone with the leak itself when the press asked him if mr libby had "outed" ms plame he said "i am not speaking to whether or not valerie wilson was covert " the original "crime " we now know did not occur mr fitzgerald never even introduced any testimony that ms plames employment was classified the trial featured a parade of different memories what did people say should mr libby have remembered a conversation the same way nbcs tim russert did for the crucial conversation mr russert kept no notes and was not even sure what time of day the conversation took place an fbi report said that mr russert said that he could not rule out discussing ms plame with mr libby but he had no recollection of that on the stand mr russert testified that he did not believe he had said that he was not alone other reporters had confused notes had lost their notes or could not remember all that well former new york times reporter judith miller who suffered jail for nearly three months until she disclosed her sources and notes admitted that she had a weak memory and testified that she had heard of valerie plames cia connection from sources other than mr libby but if testimony differs the law allows the jury to look witnesses in the eye and believe one and not the other even if there is no documentary evidence that is why perjury is a powerful prosecution tool one that was abused here among the unhappy precedents if the libby verdict stands executive branch officials will hide from the press which is unfortunate because "leaks" can be an important check on all three branches of government and even innocent officials will not be forthcoming when it comes to cooperation with future prosecutors "i dont recall " perhaps the worst precedent would be normalizing the criminalization of policy differences many of those who loudly demanded mr fitzgeralds appointment and who applauded yesterdays verdict offered no more compelling reason than that somebody should pay for the bush administrations decision to go to war in iraq the late supreme court justice robert jackson when he was attorney general warned that if the "prosecutor is obliged to choose his case it follows that he can choose his defendants therein is the most dangerous power of the prosecutor that he will pick people that he thinks he should get rather than the cases that need to be prosecuted " one wonders if mr libby must go to prison for years to protect the principle that the classified status of a former cia employee is sacrosanct even if that employee appears to covet publicity mr rotunda a professor at george mason university school of law was assistant majority counsel to the senate watergate committee see related letters "letters to the editor scooter libby was the verdict or his offense the real crime " wsj mar
