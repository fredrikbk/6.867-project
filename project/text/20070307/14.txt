bogle sees tough times ahead for stock market investors vanguard group founder john bogle doesnt believe you can forecast the stock markets short term direction but hes done a pretty good job of proving himself wrong he was bearish at the market peak in and bullish at the market low unnerved by the recent stock market turmoil here comes mr bogle warning investors that modest returns may lie ahead high dudgeon eleven years after his heart transplant mr bogle recently had shoulder replacement surgery yet at age he still gives speeches a year and hes about to come out with his sixth book "the little book of common sense investing " its an easy read that will i suspect quickly join burton malkiels "a random walk down wall street" and charles elliss "winning the losers game" as one of the indexing crowds favorite books but whats most impressive is mr bogles unrelenting zeal in fact if anything his fervor for index funds and for low cost investing has grown over the years "i really enjoy taking on the world " he allows "saint jack" may have made his name by building vanguard into a major no load mutual fund company but today he is possibly best known as the fund industrys most famous critic castigating fund executives for pushing mutual funds with high fees and hot performance to his detractors hes a textbook example of a charismatic leader who is loath to give up the spotlight and there may be some truth to that since he stepped down as vanguards chief executive in his relationship with his successor has been strained and he has grumbled about changes at the malvern pa fund family yet all this is remarkably easy to forgive for one simple reason when it comes to the big issues jack bogle is almost always right low returns for a column i wrote in early he told me "the odds are pretty good that well have a tough year in the stock market " when i interviewed him in october at the depth of the bear market he argued that "this would be a very foolish time to be abandoning the stock market " both calls proved prescient these days mr bogle isnt sounding particularly enthusiastic about the markets prospects "figure out what your stock allocation should be " he advises "now is a time to stay where you are or reduce the odds are we are in for a period of modest returns " mr bogle reckons stocks will average a year in the decade ahead he gets that estimate by dividing the markets performance into two parts its investment return and its speculative return the investment return is easy to calculate you simply add the markets dividend yield to its long term earnings growth which might be a year the markets performance however will likely stray from the resulting return thanks to changes in price earnings ratios this is the markets speculative return and mr bogle figures it will work against investors in the decade ahead he thinks we might go from todays times trailing month reported earnings to a more typical times earnings that would drag down the markets return over the next decade leaving us with a year average thats closer to this might not sound too grim until you subtract the quadruple hit from investment costs taxes inflation and investor mistakes this of course is why mr bogle has been a longtime advocate of index funds which offer a low cost tax efficient way of capturing the markets return but there has been one change in mr bogles advice he has become keener on international investing in part because he foresees a weakening of both the dollar and americas position in the world he says investors might allocate up to of their stock market money to foreign shares dividing this money equally between developed and emerging markets but because foreign markets have lately done so well he suggests moving slowly "if somebody is at and wants to go to take two years to do it " he says
