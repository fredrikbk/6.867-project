weighing the results of popular diets nih funded study gives atkins slight edge over zone ornish and learn programs in a major study comparing popular diets a group of overweight women trying the atkins low carb diet plan lost the most weight but theres one catch the women didnt really stick to the diet the diet showdown published in the medical journal jama this week aimed to clear up confusion over competing diet philosophies by pitting four popular plans against each other but far from settling the diet wars the research is already being blamed for further clouding the debate about healthy weight loss what it does do is paint a startling picture of just how difficult it is to stick to any diet none of the groups in the government funded study were able to stick with their assigned diet which included atkins zone ornish and the learn plan patterned after government guidelines most of the women assigned to the atkins diet for instance gobbled down carbohydrates in far higher amounts than the diet typically recommends and the atkins dieters were getting about of their calories from unhealthy saturated fat far higher than the recommended by health authorities the atkins plan itself has no ceiling on fat intake for that reason the fact that the atkins group ultimately fared better than women in the other groups suggests that at least trying to drastically cut carbs an easy to grasp message probably does help people control calories the women in the atkins group lost an average of about pounds after a year compared with the next best group of dieters who lost an average of nearly six pounds "is this a vindication of atkins no because they werent really following atkins " says christopher d gardner assistant professor at the stanford university school of medicine and the studys lead author "but theres something to the low carb thing thats intriguing cutting back drastically on simple carbohydrates the ones that have been adding up over all these years is clearly a step in the right direction to helping people lose weight " the research represents one of the few well designed diet studies that attempts to look at weight loss efforts in the real world where consumers flock to bookstores and read up on the latest diet fad the researchers studied four diet books meant to represent a range of approaches "dr atkins new diet revolution" was the lowest carbohydrate diet studied "enter the zone " by barry sears also restricts carbs but not as much as atkins the "eat more weigh less" plan by dean ornish drastically cuts fat and "the learn manual for weight management" is a higher carb diet that essentially follows government health guidelines the study led by stanford university researchers and funded by the national institutes of health followed overweight women who were randomly assigned to one of the four diets unlike most dieters these women had the added advantage of attending weekly one hour classes with a registered dietitian who instructed them in the details of their diet for eight weeks they were even paid &# &# and &# for showing up at two six and month intervals respectively but even with all the extra help the women who averaged years of age couldnt stay on top of the eating plans while the atkins group was aiming for a maximum of about grams of daily carbohydrates they ended up consuming about grams followers of the zone diet were aiming for of their calories from carbs and from protein but ended up consuming more than carbs and just protein the dean ornish low fat eating plan advocates no more than fat but ornish dieters in the study ended up eating fat the learn dieters were aiming for carbs and saturated fat but ended up with carbs and saturated fat in the end the dieters in the atkins group lost about pounds compared with nearly six pounds lost by the learn dieters the ornish low fat dieters lost nearly five pounds while the zone dieters lost just pounds for statistical reasons the only results that have real scientific meaning are the differences between the atkins group and the zone group obviously none of the diets produced dramatic weight loss overall the women started the study weighing an average of pounds and most ended the study still overweight the jama diet researchers also looked at risk factors for heart disease to determine if there was any difference among the dieters the atkins diet in particular has been controversial because it doesnt advise limits on saturated fat consumption which is detrimental to heart health although the atkins group at one point was eating more than fat they ended the diet consuming on average fat there was no significant increase in bad cholesterol the atkins group also posted bigger drops in both blood pressure and blood glucose levels as well as gains in good cholesterol compared with the other diet groups although such a high fat diet is ill advised generally dr gardner noted that at least in the short term the benefits of losing weight outweighed other risks but most experts including the study authors agree that the long term heart effects of the high fat high protein content of the typical atkins diet arent known "i think losing weight is easier when you cut out whole classes of foods like carbs " says susan b roberts director of the energy metabolism lab at tufts university who wasnt involved in the study "but the fact that they got more weight loss doesnt mean high protein diets that are cavalier about saturated fat are safe in the long run " dr ornish a professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco says that just because the atkins diet was easier to follow doesnt mean its better for you the jama study measured risk factors for heart disease but not the disease itself which develops over a longer period of time and some studies have shown that very low fat diets such as ornish when strictly followed can reverse heart disease "id love to be able to tell you that bacon and brie are good for your heart but theyre not " says dr ornish zone founder dr sears says he is frustrated that the diet study may be touted as a victory for the atkins diet over other programs when the women in the study didnt adhere to any of the diets as instructed to really understand which diet is most effective the eating plans need to be studied under highly controlled conditions he says "its bad science but good publicity " dr sears says but nutritionists say the real message for dieters may actually be a simple one slashing carbs is a relatively easy concept to understand and reducing the variety in your diet can also help you eat less even though the jama dieters didnt stick to the letter of the atkins diet the fact that they were trying to eliminate almost all carbs was helpful "you have rules about what you can and cant eat " notes dr roberts of tufts "so you have a list and it is short the stimulus of being able to eat stuff is narrowed " abby bloch a nutritionist and executive director of the atkins foundation a research nonprofit founded by the late dr atkins and his wife agreed that the first phase of the atkins diet is "very black and white " in that phase people cut out the most carbohydrates in order to lose weight most people dont realize that the second phase of the diet isnt as restrictive says ms bloch and is "just good healthy eating " the diet advises whole unprocessed foods in the later phases including meat dairy grains salads and fruit she noted however that atkins dieters struggle with many of the same issues as other dieters and start straying to the wrong foods dr gardner the study author says its important to note that at least some women in every study group did very well losing pounds or more showing that any diet can work if you can stick to it but for the average overweight person surrounded by sugared sodas vending machines in schools and fast food meals all the diets "are inadequate given the environment folks live in " he says
