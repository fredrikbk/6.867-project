business world the backdating molehill government enforcers hint by word and deed that they are resistant to putting half of corporate america in jail over backdating though they face intense lobbying from some quarters of the media to do just that a handful of cases have been brought one or two have resulted in guilty pleas one ceo remains on the lam in namibia but an inventory of potential prosecutions including criminal charges with possible lengthy jail sentences now numbers in the hundreds pregnant then is the matter of gregory reyes whose groundbreaking prosecution will likely set the pattern he makes a conveniently inconvenient guinea pig the ceo of brocade communications systems he didnt benefit from backdated options he had no natural or known incentive to overpay his underlings who did whats more some of the backdated options were canceled or expired unexercised costing shareholders zilch in a motion for summary dismissal of an sec charge mr reyes challenges the popular media canard that backdating entailed concealing important information from investors to recap the essential naughtiness here backdating was apparently a way for companies to create "in the money" options i e immediately profitable if not for the multi year vesting period while ducking an accounting rule that required such options to be expensed mr reyes doesnt admit to backdating anything but he strongly argues that the sec has no business alleging "securities fraud" in backdating cases because such "non cash stock option compensation expenses are immaterial to investors and analysts " he drives the point home "the backdrop is a marketplace in which employee stock option expenses were widely regarded as having little or no relation to the economic value to employees of the options issued or the costs incurred by the companies issuing them " mr reyes is stating a commonplace hes not saying investors dont care about executive pay hes saying that deriving an "expense" for employee stock options does not disclose information meaningful for valuing a companys shares forget brocade look at yahoos latest earnings release which flags several versions of income and cash flow that leave out stock compensation charges says yahoo "because of the variety of equity awards used by companies the varying methodologies for determining stock based compensation expense and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations we believe excluding stock based compensation enhances the ability of management and investors to understand the impact of stock based compensation expense on our operating income " look at any news account of company earnings in which options cost is a significant factor "sysco profit falls on stock option expense fuel costs " reported a dow jones newswires headline last year "excluding stock option expense earnings would have been cents a share " said the storys third sentence according to mr reyes brocade disclosed in complete exacting detail its options issuance during the period in question number strike price exercise terms precisely the data the market needs in order to adjust a companys share price for the overhang of options for that matter brocade also told investors what its options expense would have been had it expensed its options the information "set " in other words was complete whether or not the company "expensed" the backdated options as it perhaps should have under rules then requiring the expensing of "in the money" but not "at the money" options let it be sung from the steeples and mountaintops that accounting rules are accounting rules even when they make nonsensical distinctions between different kinds of options all of which have value to their possessors but if backdating wasnt about hiding option costs and overpaying executives what was it about happily a new study in the academy of management journal by economists robert wiseman cynthia devers and michael holmes throws a light on the central mystery by confirming an insight of whats known as "prospect theory " says prof wiseman "a puzzle about backdating is why companies need to resort to it at all if the idea is to enhance an options grant why not just dole out more options instead of resorting to the backdating subterfuge but if executives are as inclined as our findings suggest to equate their stock options with wealth even though it may be years before they can be cashed in then options that are already in the money when granted are likely to have considerably more psychological impact than those which are merely at the money " now were getting somewhere with care and precision the san jose mercury news characterizes the scandal "stock options were designed as a form of incentive based compensation backdating to a lower price is legal only if it is properly disclosed and accounted for by the company " says the new york times "backdating options is not necessarily illegal but the practice can raise serious accounting disclosure and tax issues " these are refreshing correctives to presumptions that continue to linger in certain media accounts that backdating necessarily implies excessive or "stolen" compensation that backdating violates the "rationale" for using stock options to attract retain and incentivize employees why such canards persist in the coverage is itself a bit of a mystery but editors have their reasons a more important question now is whether prosecutors will be able to scale their efforts to the actual nature of the wrong rather than the inflated version in some media reports this question may be the hinge on which justice turns
