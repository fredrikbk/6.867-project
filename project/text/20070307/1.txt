a cultural conversation with thomas quasthoff this german bass baritone is a jazz singer too thomas quasthoff an american songbook isaac stern auditorium tonight new york half a century ago the wagnerian soprano helen traubel a pillar of the metropolitan operas german wing began making appearances in new york nightclubs appearances whose success led to frequent guest spots on the television variety show hosted by the irrepressible comedian jimmy durante belting such toe tappers as " wont you come home bill bailey" with durante traubel was worlds away from her redoubtable performances of brunnhilde opposite lauritz melchior before the "diamond horseshoe " another wagnerian singer the late eileen farrell could belt harold arlens "ive got a right to sing the blues" as easily as she could negotiate her way around gluck or verdi in more recent years such first rank classical artists as sylvia mcnair and renee fleming have also proved adept at jazz vocals all four singers were born in america so it can be argued that the idiom is in their blood but tonight at carnegie hall audiences will get to hear the eminent german bass baritone thomas quasthoff strut his stuff as a jazz singer mr quasthoffs interpretations of the great masters from bach to schubert schumann brahms and mahler are widely regarded as modern touchstones of the art and with the release this month of his new cd "the jazz album watch what happens" deutsche grammophon this other facet of his artistry is revealed in all its laid back wit watch what happens indeed the program a collaboration between mr quasthoff and the jazz trumpeter till broenner includes among others arrangements of songs by gershwin ellington rodgers &amp hart lerner &amp loewe harold arlen and johnny mercer and michel legrand the marvel is that mr quasthoffs jazz singing is not just at the stylistic antipodes from his lieder singing but idiomatically so right with impeccable timing and phrasing he insouciantly tosses off these songs leaning into just the right notes of each phrase when he sings a piece like arlen and mercers "ac cent tchu ate the positive" or the gershwins"theres a boat thats leaving soon for new york " he is singing in his regular bass baritone range using his bottom notes in a way that recalls the down home rumble that tennessee ernie ford used to give to his signature ballad merle traviss "sixteen tons " yet mr quasthoff who boasts one of the most profoundly spacious bass baritone voices today slenderizes the normal richness of his tone lending to it an easy semi spoken informality that evokes frank sinatra indeed when we discuss this subject at his new york hotel the morning after his arrival from germany his list of the jazz and pop singers he listened to from boyhood starts there "sinatra was one of my heroes " he says "shirley horn was another and of course i listened to sarah vaughan billie holiday ella fitzgerald mel torme " mr quasthoff age credits his elder brother michael a journalist for influencing his initial tastes in this area "he plays saxophone alto saxophone guitar a little keyboard and to this day he is also a big hero of mine michael had started by listening to instrumental jazz oscar peterson charlie parker peter erskine later i began to move from instrumentalists to vocalists " mr quasthoff began singing jazz himself after commencing law studies in hanover at "you know how musicians tend to find each other wherever they go " he says "you find people and make music together and you begin making little tours " unfortunately his initial experiences were frustrating "concerts in a jazz club in front of people the first money i got from some jazz gigs did little more than pay the expenses of the journey " he recalls "not really enough to put a little something aside " such frustrations paralleled others he was experiencing in his classical music pursuits at the time a thalidomide baby born with a number of birth defects including hands but no arms he had been denied entry to a music conservatory because of a rule that made it mandatory for all music students to play the piano for him a physical impossibility obliged to study voice privately he also had to resign himself for some while to teaching voice and to confining his own vocal work to radio newscasting though this period is well behind him the understanding of what mr quasthoff had to endure to build his career lends additional poignance to such choices on his jazz programs as charlie chaplins song "smile" and duke ellingtons "in my solitude " at the same time his accounts of such standards as "my funny valentine" and "what are you doing the rest of your life " seem to salute his wife claudia stelzig a german journalist whom he married in "from new york i go home to relax with my family " he says getting off the sofa to show me his cellphone album of pictures of her and her year old daughter from a prior marriage "they are my treasures my loves " he says certainly mr quasthoffs consummate sense of american pop style is enhanced by his keen ear for the sound of american speech which he sings with a light touch and not a little of sinatras new jersey accent "when i sing jazz it has to sound like jazz and not like a schubert schumann brahms singer trying to sing jazz " he maintains that it has always been natural for him to switch between the classical and pop styles "i mean who really wants to listen to a berlin number sung by a classical voice " he asks rhetorically nevertheless i take issue with this point before the advent of the swing era belting style the songs of gershwin berlin vincent youmans jerome kern and other composers were often sung by classically trained sopranos tenors baritones with lighter operetta voices even as the stylistic divide between pop and classical singing widened during the s such classically trained singers as jeanette macdonald nelson eddy alfred drake mario lanza and kathryn grayson continued to sing these songs straight as they were written even such opera stars of the s and s as gladys swarthout and lawrence tibbett regularly performed some of this repertoire with great panache lightening their approach without venturing into pop style vocalism mr quasthoff sticks to his aesthetic guns however when i suggest that a song like berlins "a pretty girl is like a melody" is admirably suited to a light tenor voice "i think its much nicer " he says "if its not sung in a classical way " in fact his current thinking is to mix some of these songs into his recital programs "as encores " i ask "no no " he says "as part of the actual program first half really serious recital second half these songs " he says that he cannot understand why such american masterpieces as berlin and gershwin songs "are always excluded from the classical repertoire as examples of th century american writing i like them much more than atonal music "you know a lot of colleagues sometimes are lifting their noses when i say that we have to think about what the music should do to an audience and my very personal opinion is that throughout history back to schutz to pergolesi to bach musics primary purpose was to entertain in some way " he cites his recent performance of schuberts "die winterreise" cycle with pianist helmut deutsch in graz austria "the hall seated about people and they could have sold it three times over because it was so packed why because more than me the piece by itself attracted such a crowd " he fixes me with his penetrating eyes "touching people moving people " he says "whether in jazz or classical that is the essence of our work " mr scherer writes about classical music for the journal
