journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources military affairs retired generals reflect on price of candor two of the six retired u s generals who spoke out last spring against donald rumsfeld now regret having aired their personal opinions saying their duty to their country demanded more discretion the four other generals who publicly criticized the then secretary of defense tell writer david margolick that they remain comfortable with their decision all six former officers john batiste paul van riper chuck swannack jr greg newbold john riggs and paul eaton tell mr margolick in interviews that they initially felt compelled to make a statement about mr rumsfeld despite the belief that in a democracy military leaders shouldnt criticize their civilian commanders but all of them broke this rule because they believed mr rumsfelds conduct of the iraq war was violating even more important principles beyond specific policy failures they say they were motivated by what they see as mr rumsfelds politicizing of the military his public dressing down of talented fellow officers and his arrogance in cutting the army to unworkable levels the six "revolting generals" had very different relationships with mr rumsfeld and they have followed different paths since coming forward gen batiste former commander of the first infantry division in iraq has kept up his criticism of mr rumsfeld on news shows and in speeches gen swannack commander of the nd airborne in iraq until has retreated from the public realm feeling his remarks diminished the work and sacrifices of the paratroopers he led and gens eaton and swannack say their candor has hurt their chances of securing defense related jobs none of the generals believe the current increase of
