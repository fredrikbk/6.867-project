one tiny town becomes internet age power point quincy wash while much of the u s frets over a residential real estate slump this small farming town on washington states plains has the opposite worry a boom town economy is inflating housing prices quincy has the web to thank or to blame the towns economic boom began with the arrival of three high profile neighbors microsoft corp yahoo inc and intuit inc in the tech giants separately announced plans to build new computer data centers here but while the new arrivals have brought prosperity locals are beginning to wonder how to handle what may be too much of a good thing quincy is a town of people and two traffic lights that until now has typically seen only one to four new homes built a year now developers have filed plans for upwards of new homes and a strip mall that would include a hotel and the towns first movie theater land prices have as much as quintupled over the past year and apartment rents have jumped as much as quincys schools are becoming overcrowded and the overtaxed medical services are under more strain some local farmers worry what will become of the areas greatest economic asset and biggest business lure abundant cheap hydroelectric power "the question is is there enough power to go around and were not going to know the answer to that for years " says warren morgan general manager of the local double diamond apple packing plant a more troubling question what if the boom doesnt last the west is filled with erstwhile boom towns that over expanded during mining and timber rushes in decades and centuries past the tech industry has fed boom town economies in some western states only to pull out and leave economic disarray in next door oregon a rush of computer manufacturers into the state during the s reversed course after the industry started moving more jobs overseas quincys quandary is one of the byproducts of the internet age web use is growing and more people are employing it to swap files such as those for youtube videos or online music to cope with the increase in traffic internet concerns like yahoo and microsoft are racing to install new servers computers that store and relay large amounts of information in warehouse sized data centers that may contain hundreds of servers these tech concerns are finding that electricity is a fast growing portion of the cost of running those data centers and to trim their expenses they have turned to the pacific northwest power is cheaper in the region because of the abundance of flowing water especially the columbia river which has many dams that hold back water for hydroelectric plants the rates run as low as two cents per kilowatt hour versus as high as nine cents for conventional power quincy is just one new hot spot in the region yahoo has built a data center in wenatchee wash google inc has built one in the dalles ore a half dozen other tech concerns have been in discussions with officials along the columbia river to put in more data centers northwest communities largely welcome the data centers many like quincy have had economies pegged almost exclusively to farming and have been wanting to diversify in the past "when the farmers dont do well we all suffer " says lisa karstetter executive director of the quincy valley chamber of commerce about two years ago representatives of microsoft and yahoo began scouting the quincy area as a possible site for their data centers quincys local grant county public utility district owns two dams on the columbia river giving it a source of inexpensive power and quincy is particularly attractive because it offers another critical resource fiber optic cables that companies need to ship large volumes of data around the state passed legislation in that promoted upgrades to telecommunications networks in rural areas of washington spurring the grant county utility district to spend more than &# million laying the current fiber network the tech giants tried to keep their plans quiet at first in part so as not to unduly raise expectations among locals in case they decided to back out but word got out "somebody saw yahoo on my backpack or my purple yahoo shirt " says kevin timmons vice president of operations for the sunnyvale calif company in january microsoft agreed to buy about acres of farmland from the port of quincy for about &# million yahoo followed suit soon after acquiring acres from the port for &# intuit in november told quincy officials of its plans to build a data center on acres of land in the same vicinity then the boom began quincy expanded its urban growth zone to try and accommodate the new development real estate developers rushed in officials of entezar development group bellevue wash say they have sold out the first phase of homes in a planned home subdivision company officials say they also expect to break ground later this year on a commercial retail development of more than one million square feet that they say is expected to cost over &# million "theres almost a gold fever around here " says david lemon regional chief operating officer for the accounting and consulting firm of lemaster &amp daniels with as many as new workers moving in the town is crawling with construction workers the main drag state route sees traffic backups for the first time "were not used to waiting in line for anything " says pat tobin a local electrical contractor "if there are two people in front of you you get mad " quincys infrastructure is stretched the bed quincy valley medical center may have to spend between &# million and &# million renovating or replacing its existing facility to help accommodate the new demand from the boom as well as a surge in retirees and other new arrivals in the surrounding area says administrator mehdi merred "if the data centers were not coming in i would downsize services probably " mr merred says "but since they are coming in i will have to grow " with the first phase of microsofts data center complex set to open in a few weeks with or so employees quincy school district officials are in the market to buy more land for new schools but that effort has been frustrated so far by the soaring price of surrounding lots land prices have quintupled from &# an acre to as much as &# over the past year says roger fox the district superintendent in all school officials say they may have to spend as much as &# million to expand to accommodate potentially hundreds of more students the investment they acknowledge could be put at risk if the boom ends "i feel like im rolling the dice some " says mr fox farmers worry the data centers will eventually use up the power grant county is entitled to under its cheap contracts forcing the farmers and others to pay more for higher priced power although officials of the grant county utility district say they will be able to meet the power needs they add they might have to tap other sources including buying more expensive power on the open market if many more data centers come in the costlier power could make quincy less attractive putting a crimp on the boom still many quincy residents expect the prosperity to last once the town gets used to the changes "were going to lose the little town atmosphere " says nancy richardson owner of a shop called pots and petals "but this will set us up for the next years "
