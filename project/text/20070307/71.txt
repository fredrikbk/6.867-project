me and my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q in cold weather is it appropriate to let ones car warm up before driving or has modern technology in automobiles made this a waste of time chris mcdonough san francisco a warm up isnt necessary with most cars including many older models even though the engine will run more efficiently after the several minutes it takes to reach the correct operating temperature your car wont suffer significantly if you drive it when the engine is still cold you should however avoid putting undue stress on the engine before it warms up simply avoid rapid acceleration or "gunning" the throttle in the first few minutes of driving q i have read that run flat tires have a harsher ride about half the tread mileage and cost about twice as much to replace as conventional tires how much truth is there in these statements melvin buchanan columbus ind a there is a bit of truth in those statements but less now than would have been the case years ago early run flat designs that went on sale in the s had a noticeably harder ride than conventional tires because extremely stiff sidewalls were required to support the vehicle following a loss of inflation pressure since then changes in materials and design have resulted in run flat tires that ride about as well as conventional tires they wear at about the same rate though because run flats tend to be high performance tires with softer tread compound they wear faster than the tires most consumers buy for family cars run flats cost about more than conventional tires but generally not twice as much again the high performance nature of most run flat designs places them in a market segment where conventional performance tires are also expensive q my beloved bmw i with snow tires just died and i am left with my jaguar xk convertible which is helpless in snow i want to go to one really great exotic car that is good in snow is there such a thing robert paul mclean va a have you considered the porsche carrera or s ive driven versions of these cars in snowy conditions and even on muddy unpaved roads without complaint i think there are many sports cars that will perform acceptably in the snow if they have snow tires but all wheel drive does reduce the stress and improve the overall ease of driving in such conditions questions can be e mailed to mecar wsj com
