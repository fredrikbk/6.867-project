gap seems to feel pinch of higher rent areas with rents soaring at high profile shopping districts across the u s gap inc appears to be feeling the pinch the specialty apparel chain has passed on renewing some leases in pricey neighborhoods such as manhattans upper east side bostons newbury street and san franciscos haight ashbury section according to brokers that specialize in retail real estate in the upscale suburbs north of chicago gap appears to be scaling back its presence where it operates more than one store on th street near new york citys herald square gaps banana republic chain is exiting a square foot multilevel location that might simply be too big for its current purposes says peter ripka a partner at ripco real estate which is listing the property even so a general uptick in exits by gap from such prominent locations has been noticeable in recent months brokers say "they seem to be letting go of more stores than usual in high rent areas " says stephen stephanou a principal at madison retail group a broker that is active nationwide "these locations are not growing on trees once youre no longer there its hard in tight markets to get back into these spaces " gap which in january ousted chief executive paul pressler as it began a companywide strategic review said it will close the fledgling chain of forth &amp towne womens clothing stores it began opening months ago critics have long charged that the company could benefit from further trimming its portfolio of more than leases but gap said it will continue the relatively modest rounds of openings and closings it has made in recent seasons "over the course of the year our new business leaders will evaluate their brands store economics which could of course influence the number of future store openings and closings " chief financial officer byron pollitt said in a written statement leaving an upscale location is a move that most retailers are reluctant to make it isnt clear whether gap will eventually conclude that the brand no longer belongs in ritzy retail venues but most brokers interpret the companys recent moves as a bid to conserve cash with gaps leases typically lasting years and coming up for renewal in increasing numbers during the next few years the company will feel added pressure to win back customers says mark montagna an analyst at cl king &amp associates in new york "the upscale locations are the most obvious example but i think the problem of rising rents is going to be an issue for gap across the chain " mr montagna says "this is one big reason theyll never return to their historic levels of peak profitability " retail lease rates have skyrocketed since the late s when gaps legendary growth spurt steadily gained momentum adding more than stores to its chain in alone at the time the rapid casualization of american offices helped put gap with its stylish take on basics like khakis and polo shirts at the top of the retail food chain a mall wasnt a mall without the gap says merritt sher a principal at metrovation capital in bellevue wash and former real estate consultant to the gap "that allowed them to make a lot of cheap leases " mr sher says while the rent in a typical middle american mall may have risen since then it has tripled on hot retail strips in new york and california according to jeffrey roseman a broker at realtor newmark knight frank when gaps lease expired at one midtown new york location more than a year ago the landlord quickly leased it to another tenant more than doubling the rent to a yearly rate of about &# a square foot mr roseman says hip retail chains such as hennes &amp mauritz abs h&amp m stores as well as the closely held forever chain have opened large manhattan locations during the past few years manhattans retail rents also have been driven higher as banks competing for customers have rapidly opened walk in atm branches throughout the city "landlords cant wait to get those kinds of spaces back " mr roseman says he notes that property owners typically cut revenue sharing agreements with retailers stoking their incentive to replace a struggling tenant with demand for space so strong it also follows that it might be relatively easy for gap to exit a big chunk of stores without paying crippling sums of cash notes michael wiener chief executive of excess space retail services inc a real estate disposition consultant such a move might not be a bad idea adds peter dixon a senior partner at lippincott mercer a new york branding firm "im always optimistic a brand can never be too big to be reinvigorated " mr dixon says but trimming to of the chain might help gap find a "point of view" for its brand he says indeed gaps quest to "be all things to all people" has long been an excuse for having so many stores says carrie shea a principal at archstone consulting in stamford conn but while gaps basic affordable and stylish clothing fueled its growth in the s it also spurred legions of imitators ms shea notes target corp and j c penney co now offer basics for less and teen focused chains like abercrombie &amp fitch co and american eagle outfitters inc have pursued narrower niches with fewer stores that competition has been a big reason for the declines in gaps same store sales or sales at stores open at least a year which are a closely watch indicator of a retailers performance if rents remain stiff and gaps fashions dont recapture shoppers attention gap may begin to shrink faster whether it is part of the companys strategy or not "i would assume the rate of store closures would stay constant or even increase its not going to slow down " ms shea says
