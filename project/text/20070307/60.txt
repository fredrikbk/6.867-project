it may not bowl over yanks but cricket is a manly game icc cricket world cup west indies various venues through april watch online at www willow tv it is a source of immense chagrin to those of us who love the game and there are few games on earth that are loved with as much fidelity and gusto that cricket is disparaged in america as a languorous pastime conducted between breaks for tea by men who utter such daffy things as "sticky wicket old chap " i make no apologies for saying this but such views of the game are just not cricket and im determined to make my case by inviting readers actually to watch the game the international cricket councils cricket world cup begins next week on tuesday when the west indies the tournaments host takes on pakistan and will conclude on april when the final is played in bridgetown barbados with india thrashing australia ok that last bit is pure fantasy as is any thought of physically attending the match unless as a guest of the barbadian prime minister there isnt a room to spare on the island in the days preceding the final and cricket fans are being billeted on cruise ships anchored offshore for want of terrestrial accommodation but you can watch this match and the others preceding it on your pc assuming a high speed internet connection be warned however the relevant picture stream does not work on macs and if there ever was a reason not to buy a mac i have found it sorry steve one wonders with all the indian geeks at apple cricket watchers to a man why they have not addressed this particular shortcoming given that the time differences between the u s and the various caribbean islands are never greater than four hours you can actually watch this world cup in real time without the need as arose with previous world cups held in india or australia to wake up while those around you slumber all you must do is log on to www willow tv a web site named after the splendid and resilient wood from which all cricket bats are made and purchase a package of matches for &# a cost of under &# per match when you consider that each match lasts about seven hours thats a lot of sticky wicket for your buck in the inaugural cricket world cup played in england in there were only eight teams and the tournament was over in the blink of an eye this year there are teams the trend over the past few tournaments being a sort of match inflation to feed the gargantua of global tv this has meant the inclusion of such cricketing minnows as ireland and bermuda canada and the netherlands and many more uncompetitive matches than there used to be australia versus the netherlands at cricket or india versus bermuda is akin to watching germany take on the faroe islands at soccer but when the big boys play when pakistan meets south africa or australia takes on new zealand one gets a whiff of the cordite almost instantly cricket then takes on the aspect with which the games devotees are familiar and americans alas so unfamiliar that of a virile even brutal game in which a rock hard ball is bowled at speeds that can approach miles per hour at batsmen who stand no more than yards away no wonder there are leg pads helmets and the thing no batsman would dare take the field without testicular guards there could be few less romantic ways to die and few more painful than to be hit amidships without protection by a cricket ball unlike baseballs leather palmed catchers and fielders players who patrol a cricket field must collect or catch the ball with bare hands scorching hits must be stopped with a wall of nothing more than flesh bone and epidermis and fingers are often broken and webbing split in the process this is not to belittle baseball of course whose fielders can be breathtaking and beautifully clinical but there is an almost primitive grace to the unadorned way in which the ball is fielded that sets cricket on a higher plane as a game than its american cousin who will win this world cup a month ago only a simpleton would have bet on a team other than australia which has taken in the past five years to finishing off its foes as if at a turkey shoot on the road to basra first gulf war not second yet for reasons known only to the cricketing gods australias form has collapsed in the weeks leading up to the cup and other teams south africa india even normally hangdog england have scented the perfume of possibility giving the impression that this might be the most unpredictable of all of crickets world cups the best result for cricket would be for the hosts to win if a certain amount of romance has gone out of the game these past few years it is because cricketing luster has departed from the west indies a team made up of countries such as jamaica barbados trinidad &amp tobago guyana and antigua that weld together as one on the cricket field and on the cricket field alone the west indies was once to cricket what brazil was and some say still is to soccer unbeatable but digestibly so to neutrals on account of the grace skill and elan of their play for too long now has cricket been dominated by australias unyielding and highly tactical aggression it does not play an ugly game but its methods and mien are seldom beautiful australias cricketers care not whether they are loved except by their own fans who having drunk deeply of the same cultural cup as their cricketers celebrate hardnosed methods but if theres one good thing that might come out of an aussie victory it would be this americans might understand at long last that cricket isnt played by a bunch of petunias mr
