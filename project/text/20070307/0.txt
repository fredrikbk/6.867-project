universal health care could bankrupt taxpayers amy finkelstein writes that "universal" health coverage could offer financial stability to all americans as medicare has done for seniors although its likely to increase health care spending drastically "the cost of coverage " editorial page feb prof finkelstein describes americans increased use of health care under a medicare model as the natural consequence of increased "affordability " but whos really paying the bills medicare devours the finances of working americans dr thomas saving of texas a&amp m university estimated that medicare will consume almost a quarter of all federal income taxes by and three eighths of all federal income taxes by the dangerous consequences of medicares overspending outweigh its single benefit of financial stability for seniors the way to ensure such stability for everyone without bankrupting working americans is an efficient system for lifelong individual private health insurance similar to homeowners or life insurance this would protect against catastrophic costs and risk would be borne by competitive markets instead of taxpayers diana m ernst health care policy fellow pacific research institute san francisco while i agree with most of the assertions in ms finkelsteins analysis i wish there had been room to include something about the human side of medical costs for example she argues that "the elderly were not forgoing life saving treatments prior to medicare " while this may be technically true it reminded me of my grandparents pre medicare experience in the s my grandmother had type ii diabetes with complications she was being treated at the joslin clinic one of the leading diabetes centers at the time my grandfather a self employed italian tailor paid for her "life saving treatments" including regular surgeries to remove toes that had become gangrenous for lack of circulation but what would have happened had he been able to get treatments that could have improved the quality of my grandmothers life he could not afford to pay for someone to help her manage her diet and blood sugar levels more closely for example doing this might have reduced her need for surgeries and one can speculate prevented the stroke that left her speechless and bedridden for months before her death at ms finkelstein says that medicare provided "substantial financial protection to the elderly " while certainly true that statement does not do justice to the reality even after limiting what he spent on life saving care my grandfather was crushed by the financial burden of his wifes illness i remember walking away from the accounting office at the hospital one time after we had visited my grandmother i had never seen my grandfather look and act so old he said to no one in particular "her illness has cost me all of my savings " it was not long thereafter that he had a heart attack when he came home from his stay in the hospital he immediately returned to work sewing what he could on the dining room table until a coronary thrombosis killed him a week or so later he was i was i have always wondered if he would have lived any longer had there been good health insurance like medicare jack edmonston east sandwich mass
