bernanke hits fannie one duty of the federal reserve chairman is steward of the u s financial system so its good news that ben bernanke stepped up yesterday and put himself on record as favoring limits on fannie mae and freddie mac maybe his intervention will help prod congress to stop protecting the two mortgage giants from regulatory discipline readers of these columns know the incredible tale of fan and fred the "government sponsored enterprises" that have grown like topsy thanks to an implicit government subsidy and now pose a systemic risk to the entire financial system mr bernanke put it this way "the perception of government backing allows fannie and freddie to borrow in open capital markets at an interest rate only slightly above that paid by the u s treasury and below that paid by other private participants in mortgage markets " the companies use this subsidized pricing advantage to buy huge amounts of mortgage based securities or mbss and thus "can enjoy profits of an effectively unlimited scale " socialism can be a great business for the lucky few who game the political system congress lets the duo play this game because the companies claim that their vast mbs portfolios help promote "affordable housing " and who doesnt like that but mr bernanke also blew away that smokescreen by noting fed research showing that these portfolios "appear to have no material effect on the cost or availability of residential mortgages " in order to buy those mbss the companies issue roughly equal amounts of debt so the net result is a wash in supplying capital for mortgage finance however the companies keep piling up debt to buy those mbss growing them tenfold from through today the two have a combined total of &# trillion in debt and mbs obligations which exceeds the entire &# trillion in publicly held u s government debt we can hear our readers wondering why they cant get in on a similar "business model " mr bernankes sensible recommendation is that congress give fan and freds regulator the power to limit those mbs portfolios he has other useful ideas but his key point is that these mbs portfolios should be limited to a role that actually does promote affordable housing that is providing liquidity for "mortgages extended to households with below median income " this would mean less profit for fannie and fred but also less danger to taxpayers in case the duo guess wrong in the market and get into financial trouble this is all so eminently sensible that it probably wont happen democrats in congress claim to want to help poor homeowners but they seem only too happy to let fannie and freddie grow rich by investing in the higher income mortgage market that is already liquid enough they could better serve taxpayers and the poor if they took mr bernankes counsel
