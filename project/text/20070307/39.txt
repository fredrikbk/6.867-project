maker magna international inc and private equity groups blackstone group lp and cerberus partners lp people familiar with the matter said executives from blackstone and cerberus are having meetings at chryslers headquarters in michigan this week one of these people said the process is still in the early stages mr zetsche reiterated the auto maker is considering "all options" for chrysler including a possible sale a position daimlerchrysler outlined last month when it reported chrysler lost &# billion in but he indicated that the smallest of the big three detroit companies will look very different in the future significant job losses are a possibility the company has to consider to secure chryslers long term future he said in an interview in a separate discussion with reporters he said chrysler is likely to outsource the production of several lines of small cars to a chinese partner the company already has a preliminary agreement to have auto maker chery automobile co of china assemble a subcompact that will be sold in china the u s and europe mr zetsche said daimlerchrysler could soon sell several types of small cars made by chery in the past few years chrysler developed a half dozen or more suvs but it is discussing working with gm mr zetsche said the suv talks with gm "have potential" but havent yet come to a conclusion mr zetsche said daimlerchryslers top executives werent pressured into exploring a sale of chrysler by the companys supervisory board or shareholders "it was a proactive development not a reactive development " mr zetsche said in the interview adding that the decision stemmed from a review of the companys overall strategy last year top management "confronted" the supervisory board with the plan at a meeting feb mr zetsche said the move came amid rising investor frustration over the divisions losses the move also was influenced by the refusal of the united auto workers to grant the company health care concessions similar to those it has granted ford and gm he said mr zetsche also said he continues to have a "very strong emotional link" to chrysler which he led for five years before being named daimlerchryslers ceo in but mr zetsche played down the extent to which his personal feelings would determine the divisions fate saying any decision will be made "in consensus with" chryslers president tom lasorda and with the goal of identifying "the best most promising future" for chrysler and its corporate parent the auto makers deliberations are unfolding amid unusually public signs of dissension on its supervisory board which in keeping with german law is split equally between representatives of labor and shareholders in an interview earlier this week with the german newspaper handelsblatt daimlerchryslers top german labor representative erich klemm said the auto maker shouldnt act as a "door opener" for chinese companies seeking greater access to western markets mr klemm said that a recent supervisory board vote on extending cooperation with chery was so close that the boards chairman hilmar kopper a shareholder representative was forced to intervene to break the deadlock under german corporate governance rules the vote of the boards chairman counts twice in the event of a tie mr zetsche in yesterdays interview countered that the low profit margins associated with small cars makes it impossible to build them in the u s competitively "we believe this cooperation clearly opens up opportunities for the chrysler group " mr zetsche said john d stoll and jason singer contributed to this article
