a messy separation for an agency chief and a prized client questions for dave neupert company cramer krasselt an independent ad agency in chicago whose clients include corona beer h j heinz hyatt hotels and formerly careerbuilder com title chief executive officer peter krivkovich ceo of chicago ad agency cramer krasselt is angry after five years of working with employment web site careerbuilder com producing a series of memorable super bowl ads that helped boost careerbuilders ranking among job web sites to no from no the two firms are parting ways the agency won rave reviews for a series of ads produced in and that show monkeys working in an office last year it built on the popularity of the spots with a "monk e mail" viral marketing push but the company put its account up for review after its latest super bowl spots which left out the popular monkeys and showed instead the hazards of working in a jungle didnt rate highly with viewers in postgame polls usa todays annual ad meter poll for instance where people in houston and mclean va rank super bowl commercials on their entertainment value placed the careerbuilder ads th th and th nevertheless the site generated the largest unique audience among super bowl advertisers the day after the game careerbuilders decision to put its account up for review stunned cramer krasselt which decided not to participate mr krivkovich explained his thinking in a bitter memo to his staff titled "its a jungle out there filled with monkeys " the memo became fodder for much chatter among bloggers the episode is an abrupt reminder of the fragility of agency client relationships on madison avenue and of the weight given super bowl ad polls now conducted by a range of media outlets below peter krivkovich talks about the incident in a statement released after the interview with mr krivkovich careerbuilder which is owned by gannett co tribune co and mcclatchy co says the decision to conduct an agency review wasnt based on one factor the company says it appreciated cramer krasselts work and had hoped the agency would participate in the review the wall street journal your memo says the review was based entirely on careerbuilders poor ratings in usa todays super bowl ad poll is that the full story mr krivkovich if there was another reason they would have retorted they havent thats what brought me to the decision that this is so outlandish frankly i think that careerbuilder is going to go down in history as one of the most successful business and marketing strategies that has ever been done but also the decision to base the review on people in two states on an entertainment poll will probably go down as one of the most irresponsible and unsophisticated marketing decisions in history as well wsj you take credit for building careerbuilder com to the top job site from its no spot could it really have been all about the marketing werent other factors involved such as its backing by some of the countrys largest newspaper publishers including gannett mr krivkovich you know they had those same newspapers backing them for several years before we showed up on the scene when we take credit we dont take credit for the business decisions they made wsj how do you characterize your relationship with careerbuilder before the decision to put the account up for review mr krivkovich this is the irony of it it was camaraderie we reached all of our goals and exceeded all of our goals by such huge margins that everybody was a happy camper thats one of the reasons that we made the decisions that we did we were basing it on business relationships the way business relationships should be conducted business relationships are kind of like a marriage if you get blindsided by a divorce then somebody wasnt playing by the rules right wsj so who gave the pink slip to the gorilla ads in the first place looking back was that a good move mr krivkovich they did they said oh we need something else i think it had legs wsj were marketers at careerbuilder involved in the development process and did they approved the creative work mr krivkovich approved they were at the shoots all involved all approved and all excited thats what they were telling us wsj some critics have said you shouldnt be so shocked that the account was up for review because in the advertising business where much of the work is hard to measure clients who love you one day will desert you the next is this true mr krivkovich no this is the one place where this would be a silly remark because this is the one place where everything is trackable this account review decision was totally a whimsical very unsophisticated no regard for business business relationships or for whats been accomplished it was so unprincipled that i was not going to put our firm through that wsj a number of blogs have commented on the decision most applauding your bold step how do you expect this move to affect your business with other clients or winning new bids mr krivkovich it is yet to be decided whether well act on it but ive gotten several different companies offering to give us their business this was not a money issue it is not a big enough account to be a money issue wsj some critics say that this will only heighten the level of frenetic energy associated with super bowl advertising where drawing attention to the commercial is as important as the effectiveness of the campaign is it better to stay out of the big game mr krivkovich you should only be in there if it makes strategic marketing sense to your brand we were in there for only one reason january is one of those resolution months so we were looking for what is a platform we can launch right at that moment in time and then continue to the rest of the year if you dont have a strategic reason to do it then it is a waste of time the problem is that most people once they start thinking about the super bowl then they start thinking weve just got to do something wild and crazy and forget about the fact that wait a minute you are spending &# million you better be doing something for your brand wsj who will line up to pitch careerbuilder now mr krivkovich all the agencies will come on at the end of the day any kinds of issues of whether the company is doing things right or wrong in the way it deals with people are thrown aside i mean you and i can go through a list of companies that have done very questionable things and there are still people working with them right
