u s brazil weigh ethanol pact talks around bush visit come as new investors rival old sugar families sao paulo brazil president bush is scheduled to arrive in brazil tomorrow to discuss a possible alliance on ethanol fuel but investors arent waiting for a pact they are already pouring money into new ethanol mills and sugar cane fields here to meet growing domestic demand for the biofuel and in the hopes that exports will boom too the u s market remains largely off limits to brazil because of tariffs and quotas that protect the u s ethanol industry which is based on corn rather than sugar but japan and other energy poor nations in europe are already looking to latin americas largest country for ethanol a spate of deals is bringing new names and big money to what has traditionally been a family run industry in brazil sparking a wave of acquisitions and new projects for instance a company controlled by george soros and u s hedge fund hbk investments recently acquired a sugar cane mill and is planning to invest more than &# million on new capacity to produce ethanol other actors include agricultural trading firms such as cargill inc which acquired a mill last summer and brazils state owned oil titan petroleo brasileiro or petrobras is negotiating with japans mitsui &amp co to buy and construct mills as part of a long term agreement to supply japan with ethanol japans government is planning to require a mix of as much as ethanol in gasoline as the price of oil has risen in recent years along with fears about how fast existing oil supplies can grow ethanol has gained more attention as a potentially cheaper option and as a renewable fuel that wont ever run out president bush wants to sharply increase u s production ethanol can be added to gasoline to help extend supplies or used in so called flex fuel cars that run on either fuel while the u s produces slightly more ethanol than brazil the south american nation is seen as the worlds leader sugar cane ethanol which is basically fermented sugar that gets distilled into alcohol is cheaper than ethanol made from corn and brazilian government policies mean ethanol now makes up more than of fuel used in automobiles here brazil is proof that "the economics of a renewable fuel is very competitive " said neil koehler chief executive officer of pacific ethanol a u s based corn ethanol producer pacific is focused on supplying the u s market but because brazilian ethanol is less expensive mr koehler says it is likely the country will be first to conquer new markets such as japan which dont make their own ethanol and dont have import tariffs after weathering an ethanol crisis in the late s brazils market started to heat up with the introduction of flex fuel cars in last month more than of new cars sold in brazil were flex fuel models and companies including general motors corp have stopped building gas only autos here interest in the export market began to grow rapidly last year as mr bush began putting political weight behind ethanol "there are a huge number of investors funds traders oil companies commodities companies all considering entering the market " said jose luiz oliverio senior technology and development vice president at dedini sa a major brazilian supplier of crushers and distillers used in making ethanol from sugar cane officials from both countries say the contemplated u s brazil deal on biofuel is likely to include the creation of a body to set technical standards and support for sugar cane production elsewhere in latin america such steps are needed to create a robust international market for ethanol which isnt yet traded easily like soy or other commodities the emergence of a global trade in ethanol is changing a brazilian industry dominated by family run operations focused on sugar not on ethanol alfred szwarc an executive with unica the sao paulo state sugar cane association says momentum is building for companies that can acquire and professionalize such operations according to dedini brazil has sugar mills in operation under construction and a further in the planning stages while the majority of actual investments are from established families foreign investors are involved in about to of the newer projects while the fragmented market is an opening for investors making acquisitions has proved challenging many family owned operations dont have audited financials others have unpaid taxes or worker liabilities stretching back years "the history of sugar cane is good and bad families " said marcelo vieira sugar cane and coffee manager of adecoagro an operating company of international farmland holding llc a delaware agricultural holding company that is backed by mr soros and his family that means some investors have left brazil empty handed other companies are now looking to build new plantations from scratch outside traditional sugar cane areas near sao paulo says mr vieira who joined adecoagro after the company purchased his familys mill in the state of minas gerais for its next project adecoagro is spending &# million on a new mill in mato grosso do sul state with plans for further expansions other groups are also launching ambitious efforts aimed primarily at the export market samir kaul a partner with khosla ventures says the u s venture capital firm is involved in a pending deal to produce ethanol in brazil already a leading investor in renewables in the u s mr kaul says brazil is "the most experienced in doing it and they are the cheapest right now " land is not expected to be a limitation brazil has hundreds of millions of acres for grazing cattle that could be converted to sugar cane production for such investors the u s market remains a major draw despite a tariff of more than cents a gallon on imported ethanol if mr bushs call for the u s to use billion gallons of renewable fuels by plays out corn ethanol is expected to supply only half of that investors believe that imports will fill a significant niche and the only country positioned to be a major exporter is brazil
