business bookshelf a short course in long term value the science of success by charles g koch wiley pages &# when charles koch became the chief executive of rock island oil &amp refining after the death of his father in the company was a moderately successful enterprise based in wichita kan he renamed it koch industries in honor of his father and over the next years proceeded to transform fred kochs legacy into the worlds largest private company koch industries now a commodity and financial conglomerate that includes brands such as stainmaster lycra and dixie cups has employees in countries its revenue last year was &# billion in one generation the book value of koch industries has increased fold thats an compounded annual return comparable with the long term track record of warren buffetts berkshire hathaway but mr kochs rise hasnt come from simply investing in good companies the buffett way he runs them and many of his biggest gains have been made with turnarounds he has flourished despite family and government lawsuits business failures and the challenge of operating in mature industries not known for innovation or new technology such as basic industrial commodities textiles and cattle at age mr koch clearly feels that the time has come to pass along the business formula that has served him so well in "the science of success " he describes a technique called market based management mbm that he says evolved from his reading early in his career in history political science economics and other disciplines he arrived at an understanding of what allows a free society to prosper mr koch says and decided to apply those principles to business the five "dimensions" of mbm are vision virtue and talents knowledge processes decision rights the level of responsibility and authority accorded to employees and incentives concepts such as "vision" and "virtue" dont lend themselves easily to the precision suggested by the title of "the science of success " but mr koch approaches them with the analytic eye of an engineer he has three degrees from the massachusetts institute of technology albeit one who seems to have drawn much of his inspiration from economics he is especially fond of the "austrian school" of economists such as ludwig von mises and joseph schumpeter who emphasized production processes technology and the dynamic competitive models of "creative destruction " of course mbm didnt appear as athena did full grown and armed from the brow of zeus for years many businesses and business schools have tried to develop ways that "create long term value " just as mbm does by utilizing concepts such as internal profit centers local autonomy economic value added and comparative advantage clearly mr koch doesnt have a monopoly on these ideas but he is far ahead of the curve in his unrelenting and systematic application of them he relates for instance how koch industries applied mbm to overhauling matador cattle co s beaverhead ranch in montana an analysis identified the "key drivers of profitability" they included costs the weights of calves when they were weaned and the weight or "carrying capacity " of fully grown cattle eventually costs were reduced by mr koch reports weaning weights were raised and carrying capacity was increased by not a bad upgrade but koch industries doesnt assume that it can apply mbm to any enterprise it chooses mr koch notes that the company has bought businesses including georgia pacific two years ago for &# billion and exited others more real world examples in greater detail of mbm in action would have been welcome in "the science of success " there is not enough evidence to determine how much of the koch success is due to mbm and how much to mr kochs engineering genius his business experience or just plain luck for instance in a page summary of the evolution of koch industries he states "thanks to my brother davids leadership " the company "has grown its process equipment and engineering business more than fold " amazing yes but how were mbm principles applied were not told even the matador cattle discussion is notably short on the nitty gritty of how koch concepts were applied it seems sometimes that mbm is as much a lofty goal set by its philosophical inventor as it is a daily habit at koch industries the boss complains that his own company succeeds in practicing mbm only of the time one of the most insightful sections of "the science of success" is mr kochs description of the application of mbm to employment policy he is no fan of guaranteed lifetime employment automatic pay raises seniority or the entitlement mentality that runs rampant in big business or heavily unionized companies koch industries aggressively searches for "a" or "b" grade employees those rated "c" are let go if they dont change employee financial bonuses and incentives are unlimited mr koch says i like his anti marxist slogan "from each according to his ability to each according to his contribution " is "the science of success" indeed a science mr koch goes to great lengths to show that his mbm methodology can be objectively applied even to companies that dont enjoy the relative autonomy afforded by private ownership but can a strategy such as his work in a corporate world where companies change ceos every half dozen years and obsessively focus on quarterly earnings reports can employees handle the competitive pressure will unions slough off an entitlement mentality the biggest challenge may be to convince the business world that mbm isnt mere ideology but a practical strategy for creating long term wealth mr koch is aided in this by the fact that his company enjoys bigger sales than oh microsoft mr skousen is the editor of the investment newsletter forecasts &amp strategies and the author of "the big three in economics adam smith karl marx and john maynard keynes" m e sharpe
