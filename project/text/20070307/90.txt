politics &amp economics trials lesson just take the fifth perjury risk of talking is too great unless facts are clear lawyers say washington with yesterdays conviction lewis "scooter" libby joins a line of individuals stretching from alger hiss to martha stewart whose mistake wasnt committing an underlying crime but lying to investigators in pursuing such well known figures prosecutors hope to send a message to the meek and mighty alike dont lie but some lawyers predict mr libbys conviction may send another message say nothing at all invoke the fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination ari fleischer for instance the former white house press secretary took the fifth and then testified for the prosecution in the libby case in exchange for immunity "unless your client is in a situation where not testifying will cause them to lose their livelihood and unless youre certain of what the facts are " theres no reason people under suspicion should talk with authorities says marvin pickholz a former securities and exchange commission enforcement chief now at akerman senterfitt in new york "your best hope is to say nothing " he says prosecutors see high profile perjury convictions as a significant deterrent says alejandro mayorkas the former u s attorney in los angeles "when you prosecute high profile individuals like scooter libby for false statements that resonates in the community of potential future witnesses in the sophisticated white collar arena " making them more likely to heed an attorneys advice to be entirely truthful says mr mayorkas now with omelveny &amp myers "a lawyer has to be extremely careful to ensure the accuracy of his clients statements before" bringing him to the government or grand jury he adds still many under investigation consider it unpalatable to admit wrongdoing or to invite suspicion by pleading the fifth and end up testifying david seide a former assistant u s attorney who has both prosecuted and defended people accused of perjury says most statements that trip the perjury trap arent made with calculation but on the fly witnesses who lie often fail to consider potential long term consequences of trying to put investigators off the scent witnesses arent thinking about how their words will sound two years later says mr seide now with wilmerhale in washington "you are looking at what you do in real time what kind of statement do you make are you going to confess or not " mr seide represented former bronx n y borough president stanley simon who was summoned before a grand jury in a s corruption scandal surrounding defense contractor wedtech corp faced with the choice of testifying or "taking five" as attorneys call invoking the fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination and seeing that fact become public mr simon decided to testify that led to a perjury conviction and a five year sentence prosecutors have favored perjury charges for philosophical and practical reasons many prosecutors find noncooperation or even worse outright deception deeply offensive as special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald who is also u s attorney for the northern district of illinois said yesterday "any prosecutor would tell you in my days in new york in my current days in chicago that we cannot tolerate perjury if people dont come forward and tell the truth we have no hope of making the judicial system work " prosecutors tend to use the threat of a perjury charge to persuade a witness to cooperate with the government against a bigger target for that reason the prosecution of a well known figure such as mr libby stands out few bigger targets other than the vice president or president remain perjury charges are also attractive to prosecutors because it can be easier to nail a suspect for lying than for an underlying crime as seen in the case of alger hiss an influential aide in president franklin d roosevelts administration mr hiss advised fdr at the yalta conference and presided over the san francisco conference that created the united nations in journalist and former communist party member whittaker chambers accused mr hiss of belonging to a secret communist "apparatus" functioning within the u s government mr hiss never was charged with espionage for which the statute of limitations had passed or treason but with perjury after testifying that he hadnt spoken with mr chambers in more than a decade or given him documents a hung jury failed to convict mr hiss on retrial he was found guilty and spent more than three years in prison more recently authorities never developed enough evidence to charge martha stewart founder of martha stewart living omnimedia inc with insider trading after she ordered a questionably timed sale of imclone systems inc stock she was convicted instead in for lying to investigators about the sales circumstances bringing her five months in prison such a relatively light penalty shows that while it may be easier to convict a defendant for lying to authorities than for the underlying allegations themselves perjury isnt taken as seriously as the substantive crime and for politically prominent perjurers redemption by their patrons is always a possibility after losing his bid for re election in president george h w bush pardoned six former reagan bush administration officials facing obstruction or related charges in the iran contra scandal including elliott abrams who pleaded guilty to withholding information from congress the current president bush hired mr abrams to serve as deputy national security
