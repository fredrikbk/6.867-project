politics &amp economics as russians feud putin gains pre election bickering bodes well for kremlin sidelines opposition moscow with parliamentary elections less than nine months away the political season in russia is heating up but as the kremlin moves to cement its political control ahead of presidential elections next year the campaign is a bit surreal two of president vladimir putins closest political allies are bickering over whose party is more loyal to the popular president who doesnt belong to any party with each bloc denouncing the other for resembling the former soviet communist party meanwhile opposition parties from pro market advocates to the russian communist party complain they have been largely silenced mostly ignored by the state controlled media and in some regional elections slated for this weekend the opposition has been stricken from the ballot by authorities for technical violations this process is creating "a system of a few parties " says oleg kulikov a member of the russian communist partys central committee "the situation has become much more difficult for the opposition " since mr putin took office in he has methodically squeezed out potential rivals installing trusted allies in key positions and reasserting state control over large swaths of the economy surging prices for russian oil exports meanwhile have triggered a powerful economic rebound that has emboldened the kremlin in recent years to take a more confrontational line with the west "the kremlin has cleared the political field " says sergei ivanenko deputy head of yabloko one of russias oldest pro market parties yabloko candidates have been pulled from ballots in several regions ahead of sundays elections for reasons the party says are simply pretexts new rules enacted over the past year or so have made it more difficult for political parties to register and win seats in the national parliament kremlin officials say the changes are aimed at creating a stronger multiparty system privately officials say the kremlin would like to marginalize both the communists who continue to revere soviet dictator josef stalin and the liberal parties that got their start in the s persistent divisions within those liberal parties have prevented them from effectively mobilizing the small part of the russian electorate that supports their pro market and pro western ideologies mr putin meanwhile has made it clear that he wants to ensure his policies continue even after he steps down next year under a constitutional two term limit thanks to mr putins plus approval ratings and tight kremlin control over the media and the campaign analysts say the only real uncertainty in the december voting for parliament is whether the pro kremlin parties will win more than of the seats as they now have and which gives them additional legislative authority or just a simple majority the higher stakes battle comes three months later "the duma campaign is the first round " says sergei mironov speaker of the upper house of parliament and leader of one of the pro kremlin parties "based on the behavior in the fall of the contours and personalities of the presidential elections will emerge " the kremlin is trying to lock up the political field analysts and opposition leaders say ahead of the march presidential vote to ensure mr putins chosen successor prevails even though none of the likely candidates enjoy anything like his popularity either nationally or within the kremlin elite "they need to minimize as much as possible the risk that the opposition could take advantage of conflicts within the regime " says alexei makarkin of the center for political technologies a moscow political consultant within the kremlin speculation is rife over who will win mr putins endorsement two top government officials are widely viewed as leading contenders though neither has said he will run in the duma campaign the only tension is between the two pro kremlin parties one led by the speaker of the duma the countrys lower house and the other by mr mironov both close putin allies with criticism of the kremlin off limits the parties have focused on lining up celebrity supporters and denouncing each other the united russia party led by duma speaker boris gryzlov calls mr putin its "moral leader " citing his support in building the partys dominant position in parliament and regional governments but mr putin isnt a member of any party and he endorsed the creation last year of another bloc called just russia led by mr mironov who read out a warm letter from the president at his partys congress in st petersburg last week just russia espouses what it calls "new socialism " including higher state pensions and other benefits it described united russia as a party of bureaucrats akin to the soviet communist party united russia says it is mr mironovs party that harks back to the soviet era with its socialist slogans political analysts say just russia is aimed at drawing votes from left wing parties like the communists a strong second place finish in sundays regional elections would be a key sign of just russias viability analysts say the byzantine party rivalry comes as the kremlin is moving to introduce some carefully controlled competition into the centralized political system analysts say mr mironov for example has been pushing legal changes that would introduce elections for members of the upper house of parliament now appointed by regional governments "the pendulum is swinging back toward elections " mr mironov said but his plan which he says is likely to take effect next year calls for the regional governments to screen potential candidates pollsters say russian voters are tired of politics and with the economy growing strongly there is little sign of unhappiness with the kremlins stage managing of politics "its a show democracy an imitation " says lev gudkov director of the levada center polling agency "people recognize this but they want to believe in it like they want to believe in putin "
