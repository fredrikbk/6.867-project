specialists licensed to practice before the irs the list also includes seasonal workers at national tax preparation companies as well as small storefront and shopping mall operations yet relying on even the most experienced tax pro is no guarantee of getting a bulletproof return or even saving money indeed armed with a good software program you may well be able to do your taxes on your own in some cases preparers make very basic errors that can cost their clients money for example the irs says millions of people who hired someone else this year to do their returns for neglected to claim a special new telephone excise tax refund lawmakers are considering legislation to expand regulation of the tax preparation industry some senators have proposed requiring paid preparers to meet training and competency standards they also want to make it easier for the irs to crack down on wrongdoers concern about paid preparers escalated last year after the u s government accountability office found significant mistakes and even some cheating by workers at a few major tax preparation firms the firms werent identified adding to those concerns earlier this year the irs discovered large numbers of bogus claims for the phone tax refund many of those were on returns filed by paid preparers the irs also recently warned taxpayers to beware of dishonest preparers among the most obvious red flags preparers who refuse to sign your return who assure you that they will get you a higher refund than anyone else or who calculate their fees as a percentage of your refund amount so how do you find the right preparer should you decide you need one the answer depends on many factors such as how complex your tax situation is and how much tax planning advice you want to be sure millions of people with relatively straightforward returns probably can handle their own returns either on their own or with the help of software such as intuit inc s turbotax and h&amp r block inc s taxcut many other taxpayers comfortable with tax issues probably could do the job themselves even if they itemize as long as theyre patient willing to wade through dense irs instructions and have relatively routine situations but it doesnt take much to drag taxpayers into surprisingly deep water thats particularly true for people whose personal situation has changed such as someone who is going through a divorce

investigators found "serious errors" at outlets of several commercial tax preparation chains in some cases preparers didnt report taxable income supplied by investigators in other cases preparers didnt take advantage of tax breaks higher income taxpayers with far more complex tax questions should consider looking for an enrolled agent an accountant or another expert with extensive training among others who may need more sophisticated help investors with large numbers of trades executives who receive large amounts of stock related compensation professional securities traders someone who invests in numerous partnerships or needs to file returns in many states or a business consultant who serves on several boards of directors and has an office at home dont hesitate to ask tough questions before hiring someone for example inquire about the preparers credentials including his or her educational background and training find out how much your return is likely to cost ask what if any written guarantees the preparer offers in case he or she makes a mistake will the preparer represent you at the irs if youre audited and has he or she ever been sued or disciplined how tax

institute of certified public accountants says numerous cpas send out an estimate to clients at the start of the year with the proviso that the fee could change if the job turns out to involve a
