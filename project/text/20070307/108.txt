the afternoon report air of danger online edition soaring demand has pushed indonesias burgeoning air travel business to great heights but a series of harrowing crashes and increasing questions about safety could bring the fast growing industry low a garuda indonesia jet burst into flames in a rice paddy after overshooting the runway on landing early this morning in yogyakarta indonesia killing at least people more than passengers and crew managed to escape the burning wreckage the airline and witnesses said survivors said that the plane trembled violently as it approached the runway and one passenger told reporters that the aircraft seemed to be going far too fast as it neared ground "it literally bounced on the strip " survivor alessandro bertellotti said garuda told the media that it doesnt know what caused the crash of the boeing and the government dispatched investigators to the scene the conflagration was the third scary air travel incident in indonesia in as many months on new years day an adam air jetliner dropped off radar and into the ocean killing all passengers on board and stirring a confusing search and recovery mission that dragged on for weeks just weeks later another adam air plane cracked on landing leading to no casualties but adding to the anxiety surrounding indonesian carriers regulators have expressed worry that safety standards have suffered amid rapid growth in the indonesian airline industry strong economic growth in the asian archipelago has allowed more indonesians than ever before to purchase airline tickets according to data compiled by the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney australia some million passengers flew domestically in indonesia last year up dramatically from million in and the number of airlines has quadrupled to since given the great increase in air travel it may seem that probability would dictate a greater number of crashes and other frightening episodes more planes in the air equate to more opportunities for failure and some of the more dramatic incidents have involved younger carriers adam air started flying in and its cheap fares fast became a hit with travelers but it also drew criticism from safety officials for run ins including a flight that lost its on board navigation systems and had to rely on other aircraft to help it land at a small airport hundreds of miles off course state run garuda is far from a start up as indonesias national flagship carrier it has a solid reputation for safety when held up against its discount rivals but it has also had its share of turbulence and the fact that todays crash involved a boeing built in the same model and roughly the same vintage as the adam air new year disaster may push regulators to tighten the rules on how long carriers can employ aging aircraft indonesia has already barred its carriers from buying any s as their most recent vintage dates to the late s and transport minister hatta rajasa said he wants to impose a year age limit on commercial planes by comparison the bureau of transportation statistics reports the average age of the u s commercial fleet was years in the most recent year for which data are available mr rajasas call led to a predictable hue and cry from carriers battling to keep their costs low but as the number of crashes mount such rule changes may be hard to fight stocks slip into red the dow jones
