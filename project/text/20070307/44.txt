facing costs of plastic surgery "do you think i need cosmetic surgery " is a question likely to make most people blanch but it is one that a growing number of americans are posing to their financial advisers "i get asked that question all of the time " says judith rosenthal a senior financial adviser with ameriprise financial inc in new york for many of ms rosenthals clients saving enough for a little nip or tuck is a financial goal just like saving for a childs bar mitzvah or college education "theyre looking to earmark cash specifically for surgery " ms rosenthal says to help clients achieve life goals fee based advisers increasingly provide advice on their entire financial picture including the best way to pay for cosmetic surgery that can cost tens of thousands of dollars ms rosenthal says she would never offer an opinion on whether a client needs surgery thats for a doctor she just tries to help clients clarify financial priorities which may mean asking how having surgery would make them feel according to the american society of plastic surgeons the average physician fee is &# per body area liposuction &# for a nose job and &# for a breast augmentation and thats excluding the cost of the operating room anesthesia and any implants which can add thousands of dollars around a third of cosmetic surgery patients have multiple procedures done at the same time and a similar proportion return for further work in all americans spent &# billion on cosmetic surgery in the asps says some million surgical and nonsurgical beauty procedures were carried out more than in including liposuctions nose jobs breast enhancements and eyelid operations around million injections of wrinkle busting botox were administered walter erhardt a board certified plastic surgeon in albany ga and former asps president says patients often elect surgery because they dont think they look as good as they feel they may be motivated by the desire to compete with younger people in the workplace or by a life event such as giving birth getting divorced or becoming widowed some have unrealistic expectations that make them poor candidates he says such as those looking to save a marriage with a face lift or a bit of liposuction dr erhardt says he gets a lot of requests for "mommy makeovers" a combo of tummy tuck and breast lift from patients in their s and s while eyelid surgery and face lifts are the procedures du jour among boomers of both sexes one procedure being performed more is body contouring to remove excess skin after gastric bypass surgery for weight loss vaishali doolabh a board certified plastic surgeon in jacksonville fla says one patient lost in excess of pounds more than half her body weight such dramatic weight loss can create unsightly folds of skin all over the body that can cost tens of thousands of dollars to remove while gastric bypass surgery may be covered by medical insurance body contouring typically isnt "sometimes patients have to take out second mortgages on their homes " says dr doolabh cash credit cards or loans from cosmetic surgery financing companies are the main ways patients pay ameriprises ms rosenthal says her clients typically have sufficient cash reserves to pay for surgery a high interest account such as a cd is one solution for clients planning procedures harvesting stock options once they have become vested or putting surgery on a zero interest credit card in anticipation of receiving a bonus that can quickly clear the balance are other options tucker watkins a senior financial adviser with ameriprise in irvine calif does projections of clients expenditures to determine whether the best solution is to pay with cash or finance surgery some clients might be able to take money out of their investment portfolios without compromising their retirement dreams for those who need to finance a home equity line of credit can also be a smart way to pay advisers say "one of the most efficient ways to pay for surgery can be to tap equity in the home " mr watkins says with this revolving line of credit your home serves as the collateral with a specified credit limit during a "draw period" typically five to years the funds can be borrowed "on demand " you pay back only what you use plus interest interest rates are generally lower than on a credit card over an extended period another advantage is that much of the interest can likely be deducted on a federal tax return unlike the interest on credit card debt mr watkins recommends that his clients check with their accountant advisers can help clients compare interest rates fees and rate caps for these lines of credit internal revenue service rules dont allow money from pretax health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts to be used for cosmetic procedures which it defines as those directed at improving the patients appearance that doesnt meaningfully promote the proper function of the body or prevent or treat illness but there is work that does qualify "orthodontics such as teeth straightening would qualify as a medical expense whereas teeth whitening would not " says j d piro a principal at hewitt associates a human resources consulting firm "a breast augmentation wouldnt qualify unless it was to reconstruct a breast after the removal of a tumor " also qualifying says tom billet a senior consultant with watson wyatt surgery to treat defective vision such as laser eye surgery with time running out for employees to drain fsas for those with dollars in these accounts would be wise to put them to work he says under a use it or lose it rule employees must spend every cent they set aside before the annual deadline or lose the balance the deadline varies among employers many have set a cutoff date of march
