of those companies are saying the grants were in fact made weeks later and backdated the disclosures are the latest wrinkle in a backdating scandal that involves more than companies and has resulted in more than firings or resignations of corporate officials the new information suggests some executives profited from the markets plunge following sept by manipulating options grant dates stock options give the recipient the right to buy shares at a set price typically the stocks closing price on the day the options were granted if the stock later rises the recipient can cash in the option for a profit the lower the exercise price the greater the potential gain backdating options involves looking for past low points for a stock then pretending the options were granted on those favorable
