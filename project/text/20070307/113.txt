the libby travesty the word "guilty" had barely crossed the airwaves yesterday in the perjury case of scooter libby before critics were calling it proof that president bush "lied us into war" and demanding that dick cheney be strung up next maybe now mr bush will realize that this case was always a political fight over iraq and do the right thing by pardoning mr libby the conviction is certainly a travesty of justice though that is not the jurys fault the men and women were faced with confusing evidence of conflicting memories in a case that never should have been brought in the end they were persuaded more by prosecutor patrick fitzgeralds story line that mr libby a former aide to mr cheney had lied to a grand jury about what he knew when about the status of cia official valerie plame the wife of bush critic joseph wilson in hindsight the defense seems to have blundered by portraying mr libby as the "fall guy" for others in the white house that didnt do enough to rebut mr fitzgeralds theory of the case and so the jury seems to have decided that mr libby must have been lying to protect something the defense might have been better off taking on mr fitzgerald for criminalizing political differences for that in essence is what this case is really all about we learned long ago and mr fitzgerald knew from the start of his probe in that mr libby was not the source of the leak to columnist robert novak that started all this mr libby thus had no real motive to cover up this non crime what he did have strong cause to do was rebut the lies that mr wilson was telling about the administration and mr cheney lies confirmed as lies by a bipartisan report of the senate intelligence committee in mr libby did talk to some reporters about the administrations case for war in and he did mention ms plame in some cases so the jury apparently decided that when asked about those conversations by the fbi and grand jury he had lied about his own sources of information about joe wilson and his wife in other words he has not been convicted of lying to anyone about the case for war in iraq or about mr wilson or his wife rather he has been convicted of telling the truth about mr wilson and ms plame to some reporters but then not owning up to it one tragic irony is that if mr libby had only taken the harold ickes grand jury strategy and said "i dont recall " he probably never would have been indicted but our guess is that he tried to cooperate with the grand jury because he never really believed he had anything to hide this may also explain why mr libby never retained an experienced beltway attorney until he was indicted none of this has stopped critics of the war from trying to blow this entire case into something far larger senate majority leader harry reid hailed the conviction as proof that the white house tried to "manipulate intelligence and discredit war critics " but the charges against mr libby had nothing to do with intelligence and mr wilson was himself so discredited by summer that the john kerry campaign dropped him as a spokesman once the senate exposed his deceit what mr reid and others are doing is showing how much all this really has been about a policy dispute over iraq the fact that they are now demanding mr cheneys head is further evidence of the political nature of this entire episode but it should also be a warning to mr bush and his advisers that they too bear much responsibility for mr libbys conviction rather than confront mr wilsons lies head on they became defensive and allowed a trivial matter to become a threat to the administration itself they allowed attorney general john ashcroft to recuse himself and mr fitzgerald to be appointed even though justice officials knew that deputy secretary of state richard armitage had been the first official to leak ms plames name to reporters mr libby got caught in the eddy not because he was dishonest but because he was a rare official who actually had the temerity to defend the presidents iraq policy against mr wilsons lies as for the media most of our brethren were celebrating the conviction yesterday because it damaged the bush administration they loathe but they too will pay a price for holding mr fitzgeralds coat the bush administration will soon be history but the damage mr fitzgerald has done to the ability to protect media sources and to the willingness of government officials to speak openly to reporters will last far longer mr bush will no doubt be advised to wait for the outcome of an appeal and the end of his administration to pardon mr libby we believe he bears some personal responsibility for this conviction especially for not policing the disputes and insubordination in his administration that made this travesty possible the time for a pardon is now see related letters "letters to the editor scooter libby was the verdict or his offense the real crime " wsj mar
