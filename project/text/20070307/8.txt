ethnic routes growth market for airlines cheap travel for immigrants for hungarys wizz air focus is on trips home cork katowice for &# budapest when the european union opened its borders to eight former communist countries three years ago airline executives in the west gazed east and saw lots of poor people who couldnt afford plane tickets in hungary jozsef varadi looked west and sensed opportunity even under communism neighboring polands million people had been avid travelers cramming into tiny fiat cars to seek jobs far from home mr varadi bet even more people would get moving when britain and ireland opened up their vibrant labor markets to east europeans the trick would be creating an airline with fares low enough to rival the regions most popular mode of long distance transport the bus today wizz air the airline mr varadi founded in late is a leader among several low cost airlines that are carrying planeloads of poles hungarians and others to western europe with one way fares starting at less than euros or about &# including taxes nearly one million east europeans have moved to britain ireland sweden germany and other countries since the eu expanded from to nations in thats helped make the eastern european skies one of the worlds fastest growing airline markets western europes no frills giants ryanair holdings plc and easyjet plc also have belatedly joined the fray "we knew that once the borders opened people would move " gloated mr varadi in a recent interview at his spartan office near budapests ferihegy airport the rise of wizz is a stark illustration of the impact of the eus deregulation of airlines combined with its expansion to what is now a country bloc the polish population of london for example has swelled so much that some cinemas show movies subtitled in polish twelve polish cities as obscure as rzeszow and bydgoszcz today are linked by air to an equal number of airports across britain up from three locations for each country in skilled polish laborers like plumbers and electricians have headed to britain in such large numbers that wages in poland are rising luring some of them back home wizz is growing amid a broader trend in the global aviation industry as carriers search for new markets and grapple with increasing competition workers from asia africa and latin america in unprecedented numbers are seeking their fortunes far from home airlines have responded by creating an informal new travel category today alongside business and leisure they are courting so called "visiting friends and relatives" traffic last summer anna szturgulewska a pharmaceutical student from northeast poland paid about &# for a round trip ticket on wizz to london where she cleaned hotel rooms six years earlier she recalls her cousin paid that much for a hour bus ride to london "for the same price as the bus i could fly " says ms szturgulewska airlines also call this "ethnic traffic " and it takes many forms dubais emirates airline got its start two decades ago flying guest workers from india and pakistan to jobs in oil fields and construction sites around the middle east air france klm sa has a huge network across africa southeast asia and the caribbean that serves european residents from old french and dutch colonies among u s carriers delta air lines inc recently launched nonstop service from new york to kiev the capital of impoverished ukraine and accra ghana partly because so many people from those countries have moved to the u s seeking work delta now plans to add bucharest and lagos nigeria "we are going further into ethnic markets " said andy renner deltas director of international network planning although these fliers travel cheaply they are reliable customers business travelers pay premium fares but there arent that many of them leisure traffic meanwhile is seasonal and vacationers often choose a new destination for each trip which complicates airlines network planning the visiting relatives traffic is more predictable "from an airline perspective its attractive because its captive traffic " says craig jenks who runs airline aircraft projects an international consulting firm in new york sustaining profits in this high volume low margin market requires adaptation for example since many people in britains huge indian community lack credit cards british airways plc employs a specialized travel agency that distributes tickets to be sold often for cash through a retail network including indian restaurants and grocery stores many travelers on wizz and eastern europes other low cost airlines like slovakias skyeurope airlines and lot polish airlines subsidiary centralwings speak no foreign language so wizz staffs native cabin attendants for each country rather than using recorded announcements for different languages todays airborne search for a better life follows the pattern of earlier labor migrations by steamship and rail but compared with the great irish and italian emigrations to america over a century ago todays immigrants aspire less to shed their national identities they can stay constantly linked to their homelands via phone mobile text messaging and internet connections and those ties boost back and forth air traffic within europe ethnic travel opportunities are huge because distances are relatively small significant expatriate communities are sprouting from cork ireland to malmo sweden mr varadi a native hungarian got a sense of the potential when he joined the aviation business in as the year old chief executive of state owned malev hungarian airlines formerly a procter &amp gamble executive in charge of corporate sales across central and eastern europe mr varadi steered malev through the aviation crisis following the terrorist attacks of sept one of his achievements was to clinch a favorable deal to lease a fleet of planes for malev from international lease finance corp a unit of u s insurance giant american international group inc ilfc chief executive steven udvar hazy a hungarian emigre and aviation industry heavyweight recalls that he was struck by mr varadis "entrepreneurial spirit" something rare at the bureaucratic malev in hungarian elections sparked turmoil at the airline and mr varadi was forced out within months he persuaded five former colleagues to leave their jobs and help start an airline to capitalize on the eus pending enlargement on may joining the eu meant airlines from estonia to slovenia instantly would be allowed to fly among any airports in the bloc rather than just in and out of their own countries under eu rules in effect since the mid s though most eu countries traditional flag carriers havent taken advantage the freedom was an opportunity for budget carriers to blossom with the expansion britain ireland and sweden also opened their labor markets allowing east europeans to work legally there other big eu members however have kept their job markets shut limiting their appeal as airline destinations so far many western european airline executives were skeptical of easterners "its not just that they dont have any f money " ryanair ceo michael oleary said with characteristic bluster in an interview with this newspaper in late "its that they dont have any f holidays either " mr varadi believed that the key to unlocking this potential new market was trumping competition from buses subsidized trains and old cars to do that mr varadi modeled wizz after mr olearys ryanair europes largest discount carrier he squeezed as many seats as possible on each plane and wizz charges for on board snacks and flies unusually long hours from a m to midnight sticking to the ryanair model mr varadi opted against launching his airline at a big city airport in budapest or warsaw that would be an expensive base instead he selected katowice a grim polish city of coal mines car factories and almost no air traffic the towns appeal was a population of million living within a two hour drive but airport officials were still wary when the carload of hungarians arrived in june promising to build a major airline "they were polite but their body language said they didnt believe a single word we said " recalls mr varadi it took wizz managers months to sway katowice officials the next challenge was winning over passengers mr varadi and his team knew from previous experience with multinationals in eastern europe that new brands ranging from shampoo to chocolate and cars could quickly dominate a market if they gained an image of quality and value mr varadi realized he had to move quickly to grab peoples attention because other low cost airlines such as skyeurope were starting to expand in the region "we wanted to shock the market " says chris nurko then a manager at futurebrand a british marketing consulting firm who advised the team to choose a snappy name for the airline the team considered possible words of which around were checked for potential embarrassments in local languages they then presented mock up logos for four hop zoom tutti and wizz at focus groups with consumers in poland and hungary "after four hours people said all they remembered was the strange wizz name " recalls wizz communications manager natasa kazmer to grab more attention the name is splashed in giant pink and purple letters across the carriers planes and written "w zz " with an exclamation point the next step leasing planes proved easier than mr varadi expected because of a glut of jetliners on the market in the post sept slump financing wizz was harder appreciating the skepticism a hungarian start up airline could face among western investors mr varadi tapped his best contacts mr udvar hazy introduced him to van dubose a former goldman sachs investment banker in london who helped raise &lt euro&gt million in seed money soon after indigo partners llc a phoenix private equity group focused on transportation also agreed to become a financial backer if european investors signed on to operate as an eu airline wizz needed at least european capital mr varadi assumed indigos commitment would help raise that but investors werent nibbling "it was very frustrating " recalls wizz chief financial officer andras hajdu of those days in early "we had marketing materials ready in february but we didnt have money " the team decided to launch their airline anyway bankrolled only by their european seed money wizz staffers dropped promotional fliers at internet cafes and foreign language schools around katowice they managed to produce and air a local television ad that joked about visiting relatives showing a well dressed young man sitting awkwardly in a dingy living room next to an older man in a sweaty tank top clipping his toenails the tagline "for zlotys &# you can even visit people you dont like " wizzs first flight on may was packed traffic continued to rise that year as the airline added more planes to its fleet with so many first time fliers cabin staff needed special training to deal with passengers who were either scared or refused to stay seated buckle up and not smoke recalls ms kazmer wizz scraped by financially during its first year then in february mr varadi managed to close a deal for &lt euro&gt million in funding that met eu rules with more than half coming from two of wizzs european suppliers and the rest from indigo a few months later wizz ordered new as from airbus and upped its order by planes one year later last year wizzs low fares attracted three million passengers in the first half of the most recent period for which figures are available wizz held of the polish airline market based on number of passengers second only to flag carrier lot according to the polish civil aviation authority one rival air polonia went bankrupt in and skyeurope last year pulled back in poland pressure on ticket prices from customers and rivals remains intense mr udvar hazy at ilfc which now leases wizz one of its nine airbus as says mr varadi "needs to pay more attention" to lifting fares although he adds the ceo is "learning fast" to match prices more closely to demand mr varadi says that like ryanair wizz is more focused on keeping costs low an approach that has allowed the airline already to post an operating profit the closely held company wont give details wizz faces a delicate balance between squeezing costs and alienating consumers on a recent flight for example the carpets were worn from heavy traffic and overhead bins smudged with fingerprints mr varadi acknowledges that since wizz keeps its planes flying an unusually long hours each day cabins can get "a bit dirty " a discount carrier with a much bigger fleet like ryanair has more flexibility to take a plane out of service to fix cosmetic problems mr varadis next challenge comes from ryanair itself which has belatedly entered the market it first disdained ryanair quickly grabbed of the polish market flying to nine airports there in the first half of last year up from almost nothing in it now flies to most of the other expansion countries mr oleary at ryanair concedes that he completely missed the regions potential in but he predicts that wizz and others will get squeezed out by the irish airlines heft mr varadi retorts that wizzs low costs rival ryanairs and that wizz will survive the onslaught wizz also has a running start he says because its business is built on polands reliable ethnic travelers "we always knew theyd come " says mr hajdu wizzs cfo "were lucky michael oleary didnt see it " keith johnson contributed to this article
