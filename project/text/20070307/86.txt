politics &amp economics nonprofit takes on big media group seeks to block fcc easing of limits on cross ownership hundreds of liberal activists are expected to pack the pews tonight at the broad street presbyterian church in columbus ohio to protest a bush administration plan it has nothing to do with iraq it is about rules governing how many properties media companies should be allowed to own in local markets kevin martin the republican chairman of the federal communications commission wants to loosen existing ownership limits on newspapers and broadcasters to allow them to own both in most markets but his efforts have stalled the result of a surprisingly energetic grass roots opposition campaign guided by free press a nonprofit with offices in washington and northampton mass "such changes could have a serious impact on the diversity of viewpoints and coverage of local issues in every community " the group argues in fliers and an internet site under its "stop big media" campaign for a relatively low profile organization free press is on a roll four years ago it used old fashioned grassroots organizing along with basic internet tools to help derail the fccs years long effort to relax media ownership rules last year the group thwarted a multi million dollar lobbying effort by the baby bells to rewrite the nations telecom laws over "net neutrality " the idea that internet providers cant discriminate against any internet traffic progressive left leaning grass roots activists have gotten more attention for their opposition against the iraq war but their bigger impact may have been on national media regulations and telecom policies by mobilizing the progressive left to focus on media and telecom issues free press has effectively blocked some of the most wanted issues on corporate wish lists the free press success is all the more remarkable given the array of big name media companies pushing for change technology has changed the competitive landscape said a coalition of media firms including belo corp cbs corp news corp s fox entertainment group and nbc universal inc in a december letter lobbying the fcc to ease the rules the fcc "should modernize its local ownership rules to reflect these dynamic changes in the media marketplace " they say media reformers have been working on these issues for years but "theyve never had traction among grass roots america before " says mike mccurry former press secretary for president clinton mr mccurry drew scorn from left leaning bloggers last year after he helped launch a public relations effort on behalf of phone companies hoping to kill net neutrality rules free press which launched in has members about two dozen full time employees and an annual budget of roughly &# million last year it raised more than &# million in funding mostly from liberal leaning private foundations including george soross open society institute in almost half of its funding &# came from the schumann center for media and democracy which at the time was overseen by its president journalist bill moyers this year the group is hoping to raise &# million and wants to hire more grass roots organizers it is raising its ambitions as well after stymieing efforts to loosen media rules free press members believe they may be on the verge of changing the terms of the debate to tightening regulations again "were going to use this opportunity to move the goal posts " says josh silver free press co founder and executive director unlike other watchdog groups that have focused on telecom and media reform issues in the past free press has successfully tapped into the grass roots network dominated by moveon org "we just have to remind them to talk about media reform not the war " says amanda ballantyne free presss

media ownership hearing with the help of local organizers nearly people showed up even with a strictly enforced two minute time limit it took seven hours for the fcc commissioners to listen to everyone in february the group attracted more than activists and bloggers to memphis for three days of workshops and speeches from progressive and liberal heroes including the rev jesse jackson and mr moyers "if you watch tv news its all car crashes shootings and brangelina if we cant create more hard hitting journalism then we have a real problem " says mr silver a political activist who says he
