kosovos road to independence pristina kosovo kosovo still trying to emerge from belgrades long and difficult rule and more recently from international control has a long way to go to establish a viable stable state but its slow halting progress is being impeded by its former serb masters backed in the united nations by russia once the poorest and mostly forgotten part of the former yugoslavia kosovo still suffers from massive unemployment weak political institutions and much corruption but it is an increasingly vital place and its energetic people are looking for a new burst of activity when independence finally arrives meanwhile serbias glory has dimmed it could become a dynamic state as evidenced by recent market reforms and an uptick in economic activity but it is no longer a political leader or the hub of the western balkans and it is unlikely to resume its former prominence for some years its people have endured slobodan milosevic war international isolation declining living standards and belgrades mismanagement and if its leaders persist in fighting to the end to hold kosovo and even after defeat to try to undermine an independent kosovo that will not change much kosovo independence is very much about serbias future persistence seems to be the order of the day in belgrade the serb political class led by prime minister vojislav kostunica is risking the future of their country in a desperate attempt to hold on to a territory they do not control for a people who want no part of serbia and whom serbia does not want as part of its polity indeed kosovo has already been severed from serbia mr kostunica has spent the past year doing his best to belittle the u n secretary generals special envoy for a kosovo settlement former finnish president martti ahtisaari and to resolutely oppose his proposal for the final status of the territory that proposal provides for what is commonly called "supervised independence " heavy protection for an understandably frightened serb population and orthodox religious sites and an eu mission with significant power over the new state mr kostunica also spent the year trying to delay movement on mr ahtisaaris proposal hopeful that delay would enable him to generate support for serbian sovereignty in a wavering europe and perhaps spark violent behavior from the kosovo albanians in pursuing delay mr kostunica crafted and won in a much questioned referendum last october a new constitution whose preamble proclaims kosovo an inalienable part of serbia he recently threatened dire if unspecified action against any state recognizing kosovos independence and now there is even much talk in belgrade of partitioning kosovo which the west has resolutely opposed mr ahtisaari is expected make his recommendations for kosovos final status this week which the u n security council will take up later this month the u s and eu countries will accept them and support repeal of its resolution of that provides for serbias sovereignty over kosovo this will in effect endorse kosovos path to declaring independence mr kostunica is pinning his hopes on russia vetoing any such action thus leaving intact moscow presently asserts that both parties must agree to any kosovo settlement in effect endorsing continued serbian sovereignty over kosovo russia which has contributed little to the balkans the past years is threatening to upend the settlement long sought by the west which has invested enormous resources to bring a measure of stability to the area whether in the end russia vetoes a new u n resolution remains to be seen much depends on the determination of the west to proceed if the west can not get the russians to at least abstain on a new resolution an essentially regional issue becomes a far messier problem with wider geopolitical concerns in that event the u s and eu countries will have to find the fortitude to recognize kosovos independence without the stamp of legitimacy of a new u n resolution the security council faces a dilemma breaking up a country is a rare event a number of countries want a legal basis for kosovo independence and may prove unwilling to recognize an independent kosovo without one but many countries also realize that serbia has lost kosovo and that kosovo independence is essential to reduce uncertainty in the balkans and remove a major cause of instability moreover the chance of both serbia and kosovo to prosper and be integrated into the eu requires a resolution of kosovos status nor does independence necessarily end the kosovo problem kosovo is not montenegro whose separation from serbia was also fiercely resisted by mr kostunica many serbs have a deep emotional attachment to kosovo which is easy for foreigners to discount serbias leaders have to decide whether they want to accept the verdict of the west to cooperate in shaping a new balkans including an independent kosovo and to pursue seriously membership in the eu or do they search for every means to destabilize the new kosovo and their neighborhood the answer is not apparent serbias progress lies in its leaders hands mr abramowitz a former u s ambassador to turkey is a senior fellow at the century foundation
