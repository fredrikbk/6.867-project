americas unfriendly skies in the u s you can buy or rent the basics food shelter and clothing from foreigners foreign owned and controlled firms participate freely many very successfully in such critical industries as automobile manufacturing and sales electronics municipal water supply oil exploration and production pharmaceuticals power generation and almost everything else we use you can buy a ticket on a foreign airline between the u s and virtually everyplace in the world that gets air service and foreigners can rent you cars and sell you a bus ticket but no foreigner offers you a ticket for air travel within the u s this is not because no one wants to in the latest example virgin airways of britain a company that controls airlines in the u k continental europe australia and the south pacific has been trying since to start a domestic airline based in san francisco it has assembled a management cleared the federal aviation administrations safety hurdles and bought new planes half a dozen of which are now sitting wastefully on the ground waiting for permission to fly the problem is that the law that supposedly deregulated the airline industry still contains provisions dating from the s forbidding foreign ownership and control of domestic airlines over the years ingenious lawyers have devised investment and governance formulas that would allow de facto foreign investment in domestic airlines with enough control to protect it from management incompetence or treachery not one has ever been allowed to succeed egged on by airline pilot unions and the biggest u s airlines washington has forbidden them to do so in the current case virgin has turned itself inside out trying to construct a governance and financial structure that would satisfy a liberal interpretation of existing law although inclined as a matter of current policy to find a way to approve its application the department of transportation has bowed to congressional grandstanding at the behest of unions and large airlines that dont want the competition some also want to hold virgin hostage to get entry to londons heathrow airport as recently as december the dot once again shied away from interpreting its rules to allow virgin america to start flying in response to the previous set of dot objections virgin america now has an entirely u s management and an elaborate financial arrangement which at least nominally cedes financial control to u s citizens it meets the letter if not the spirit of the protectionist requirements of current law but thats apparently not good enough to allow virgin to offer traveling americans the chance to accept or reject its particular mix of service and prices in a supposedly free marketplace now the last excuse for government intransigence has been taken away on friday the dot announced that the u s and european union have initialed an agreement that creates an entirely open entry single market regime between the u s and the whole eu including londons heathrow airport in return the europeans insist that the u s allow cross border investment in u s airlines but the europeans having had the dot dash its expectations regarding investment before are insisting that congress agree explicitly to liberalize eu investment in u s airlines for u s travelers this is a good deal the prospect of more competition may make existing managements and workers nervous but travelers get to try virgins flashy brand of service while the new competition holds prices down for many airline shareholders and workers it will allow a troubled u s airline to be bailed out and rebuilt if necessary by the likes of air france british airways or lufthansa the u s has no monopoly on protectionists washington should make clear that its approvals depend on the british governments resisting british airways efforts to kill the heathrow access part of the deal in addition there are many technical ins and outs to defining "ownership" and "control " we can expect protectionist opponents to try to block the deal by defining these terms in a way that effectively prevents investment by leaving so little control that the investor is at the mercy of its management or banks congress must avoid this and hurry to approve this deal in a way that allows virgin and others to go forward the dot should help put them on the spot by approving virgins application now mr levine distinguished research scholar and senior lecturer at nyu school of law was one of the architects of airline deregulation and has been a senior executive at three airlines
