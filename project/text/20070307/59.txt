in nikko bid both citi city could benefit financial titan tokyo would get their wish a big global splash tokyo the next big japanese investment bank could be citigroup inc the worlds largest financial services institution by market value said it would launch a &# billion tender offer for the shares it doesnt already own in nikko cordial corp japans third biggest brokerage firm if completed the transaction would be the largest acquisition of a japanese company by a foreign firm and would be the most significant example of how japans once protected financial industry is opening up the tender could be a sign of progress for tokyo as the city strives to establish itself as a global financial hub japanese authorities would like tokyo to play the same role in asia that new york and london do in their respective regions the tokyo stock exchange for example has sought to establish links with other stock markets around the world and financial services minister yuji yamamoto said in january that he was considering measures such as tax incentives and preferential treatment to attract foreign financial firms to tokyo nikko cordial in which citigroup currently holds a stake of just under is reeling from an accounting scandal that has eroded its business and the firm faces a possible delisting of its shares but a deal would give citigroup access to nikko cordials huge client list and a retail network of branches as well as bolster its investment banking business such a deal would transform citigroups operations in japan and help it move toward chairman and chief executive charles princes goal of getting of citigroups revenue from foreign markets up from at present japan has the worlds second biggest stock market after new york as well as the worlds biggest government bond market "it is a rare opportunity for us to really accelerate our growth this really opens up a lot of things to us " mr prince said "i think the growth possibilities are pretty good it is a very big economy and our share is small " citigroup sees japan as particularly promising because the needs of both consumers and corporate clients are changing as more japanese look to the stock market for better returns than they can get on their bank accounts citigroup is betting it will find a big client base for its wealth management products and services as well as for its credit card and retail banking services "it is a clear signal a step in the direction for more competitive capital markets in japan " citigroup japans chief executive douglas peterson said despite its size tokyo has lagged behind other major financial centers in its openness to global business three big securities houses nomura holdings inc daiwa securities group inc and nikko cordial dominate the underwriting and retail business since the markets have been stagnant for years growth has been crimped in the finance sector which accounts for of the japanese economy that compares with in the u s and in the united kingdom tokyo also has fallen from favor with companies seeking public listings just of the companies listed on the tse are foreign compared with in new york and in london japans first push to expose its financial industry to competitive forces came in when it began implementing a package of overhauls based on the "big bang" deregulation in the u k fixed stock trading commissions were phased out removing some of brokerage firms profit cushion brokerages were allowed to sell sophisticated financial products such as bonds built from mortgages other changes allowed brokerages to bundle trades for multiple customers giving them an opportunity to trim costs these deregulations gave foreign investment banks long used to these types of products an opportunity to expand in japan where they wrested business away from the locals last year goldman sachs group inc ubs ag and nikko citigroup ltd the joint venture were the three biggest mergers and acquisitions advisers based on the value of their deals according to data tracker thomson financial citigroup however has hit problems in japan profits in that country totaled &# million in a drop from five years earlier in last years fourth quarter citigroup took a charge of &# million after closing of its japanese consumer finance branches because of new regulations on loans its reputation in japan also suffered from a series of run ins with regulators in japanese regulators pulled citigroups private banking license after finding that it had misled customers about investment risks tied loans to specific investments and allowed transactions that may have been linked to money laundering since then citigroup has taken steps to remedy these problems in january the bank said it would establish a holding company in japan so a layer of senior management would be responsible for all of citigroups activities giving regulators a team of people they can contact if any problem should arise citigroup wanted to quickly cut its deal with nikko cordial announcing its offer while the japanese company still has its stock listed on the tse that is because it wanted to avoid seeming like an aggressive foreign firm taking advantage of a japanese company in trouble to buy its stake on the cheap people familiar with the situation say it also considered nikko cordial to be a good fit and wanted to act before a potential rival could emerge "it is one of those rare opportunities that crops up " citigroup japans mr peterson said "the retail market is expected to grow as savers transform into investors " the offer for nikko cordial covers all its shares and would give shareholders yen &# for each share they own a premium from the stocks closing price of yen yesterday the potential premium eroded because nikko cordials stock price has risen significantly yesterday alone as speculation grew that citigroup would make a move citigroup said it would announce the starting date of the tender offer in coming days
