when an etf is not an etf legal structures and regulators can vary while tax implications may not be clear exchange traded funds are hot but not all of them are "funds " etfs are kinds of mutual funds that trade on an exchange throughout the day and they are increasingly popular with investors partly due to their low costs but as etf providers push into nontraditional investments such as commodities and currencies they are launching products that arent actually mutual funds rather they are set up as "notes" or other legal structures for the most part these new investment tools behave in the market just like regular etfs but because they are set up under different laws than etfs and mutual funds they differ in important ways of particular significance to investors in some cases the tax implications arent completely clear the internal revenue service hasnt yet issued a ruling on how some of these new exchange traded investment tools should be treated kathleen moriarty a lawyer at katten muchin rosenman llp who has helped create several exchange traded products argues the new structures be given another name like an "exchange traded vehicle " or etv to make the distinction clearer for investors "theres a lot under the hood investors have got to look for " she says the typical stock etfs are set up under the same law as mutual funds the investment company act of which has several requirements meant to protect individual investors for instance each fund or etf must have a board with a majority of independent directors whose job is to watch over the funds adviser on behalf of investors in the fund there are also restrictions on the kinds of investments the fund can have these funds are overseen by a special division of the securities and exchange commission the investment management division the point of all this "to prevent unreasonable fees or self dealing " says jane kanter a securities lawyer at dechert llp mutual funds and regular etfs are restricted from making significant investments in commodities and commodity futures under the investment company act thus some of the exchange traded products that focus on commodity investments fall under the purview of the commodity futures trading commission which regulates futures and options unlike mutual funds and stock etfs many of these products arent required to have a majority independent board of directors they are still registered with the sec just like any other security trading on an exchange there are currently nearly of these etf like commodity and currency products available to individual investors most were launched within the past three years they generally invest not in stocks but in futures contracts or actual commodities as companies try to offer products in "asset classes where traditional mutual funds may not work because of restrictions placed on them well see more" nontraditional structures says scott ebner a senior vice president at the american stock exchange there are also more than a dozen regular etfs investing in the stocks of companies that deal in energy or natural resources they include the vanguard energy etf or the ishares s&amp p gssi natural resources index fund both are regulated under the investment company act the new products can differ significantly in structure consider the etns issued by barclays capital inc the investment banking arm of barclays plc under the title ipath they are basically a type of debt instrument in which barclays promises to give the investor the return of an index or currency minus a fee so for instance the ipath dow jones aig commodity index total return etn promises to match the returns of the index minus the investment products fee the notes arent backed by collateral unlike regular etfs which are backed by the underlying securities a key attraction of etns is their tax treatment which according to barclays lawyers is that any gains on their sale should incur the lower long term gains tax of dig deeper into the prospectus however and it states the irs may suggest a different treatment this has happened before in the irs made a ruling on another type of commodity based investment that caused some commodity focused mutual funds to change their holdings because of issues like these investors should check with their tax advisers philippe el asmar a managing director at barclays capital says the etns help provide exposure to investments that may be harder to access because of regulatory restrictions "we are trying to make etns as close as possible to etfs " he says some etfs have had to go through a lengthy vetting process with the secs investment management division which etns can avoid "sometimes well use etns as opposed to etfs because it might be easier to get approved " mr el asmar says one of the oldest commodity products in the market is the streettracks gold shares launched in a trust holds the physical commodity units of gold in this case and shareholders of the trust get a return equal to the price of the gold minus expenses this is called the grantor trust structure under this structure gains from the sale of a unit of streettracks gold trust are treated as if the investors held the proportionate share of gold itself so any shares held for a year or more may result in a maximum tax of as opposed to the tax rate applicable to other long term capital gains other products that use this structure include the ishares silver trust and ishares comex gold trust from barclays global investors currency products from rydex investments such as the currencyshares euro trust also follow this structure but have a different tax treatment any gains on the sale of currencies or any interest distributed to investors are usually taxed at the ordinary income tax rate another popular structure is the commodity pool such as the powershares db gold fund which uses futures to track the deutsche bank liquid commodity index gold it is a good example of how investors need to be aware of tax implications of both the underlying investments of the product as well as the product itself any capital gains from the fund are passed on to investors and generally taxed as long term gains and short term gains two commodity products offered by victoria bay asset management llc u s oil fund and the u s natural gas fund also use futures they attract similar taxes like the powershares db funds but their tax reporting is different these are set up as partnerships so they come with a complicated and lengthy tax reporting form used by partnerships
