key house democrats add to private equity tax push washington the campaign to raise taxes on wealthy hedge fund and private equity managers got a big boost friday with the new endorsement of several leading congressional democrats the broad attack appears set to snag managers of venture capital firms and real estate partnerships as well house ways and means chairman charles rangel and financial services chairman barney frank joined a dozen lawmakers co sponsoring legislation that would require managers of certain private partnerships to pay ordinary income tax rates of as much as on "carried interest" a cut of profits they receive which currently is taxed at the long term capital gains rate advocates of the idea including former treasury secretary robert rubin who remains influential among washington democrats say "carried interest" in the targeted partnerships is more like regular compensation than investment income and that there should be greater consistency in the tax code while much of the rhetoric in the debate to date has focused on hedge funds and private equity firms the bill is written in such a way that it would cover managers of any partnership that manages or invests in securities or real estate the bill is the second time in two weeks that prominent lawmakers have gone after the rapidly growing financial sector a week ago the top democrat and republican on the senate finance committee introduced legislation that would boost taxes on publicly traded financial partnerships such as blackstone group lp which began trading friday senators have expressed interest in the "carried interest" issue as well but have yet to file legislation the new house bill on carried interest also included a provision lifting taxes on publicly traded partnerships similar to that in the senate the big question hanging over washington and wall street is what the prospects are for these proposals to make it into law the backing of top leaders means the proposals have a good chance of passing the house prospects in the senate are less clear democrats there have a razor thin majority and procedural rules in that chamber essentially require a super majority of votes to get such legislation through investment industry lobbyists believe they can rally the votes they need in the senate to block at least the carried interest bill unlike the blackstone legislation which has divided the industry the carried interest bill has already mobilized a wide range of firms in opposition and even if legislation clears congress president bush could well veto a bill he says violates his aversion to tax increases the contours of the argument are becoming clearer democrats will paint the carried interest bill like the blackstone legislation as a narrowly targeted attempt to close an unjustified loophole benefiting a small group of the u s economys most spectacular winners republicans will seek to cast it as a broader bid by democrats to attack the shape of a tax code they argue has fueled growth and stock market gains throughout the bush years in particular they will cast democrats goal as wiping out the preferred tax treatment for capital gains that has benefited a swelling "investor class" as stock ownership has proliferated the chief sponsor of the house bill michigan democrat rep sander levin said he wasnt convinced by industry arguments that lower tax rates are necessary to continue the economic growth fostered by the industries "we can combine growth and equity " he said "and we need to be able to look every taxpayer square in the eye and say whatever they do whatever kind of work or service that we dont differentiate " the real estate and venture capital industries which have long worried they would swept into lawmakers efforts to tax the managers of private equity firms and hedge funds vowed to fight the proposal "it seems to be very broad in its application " said stephen renna senior vice president at the real estate roundtable douglas lowenstein president of the private equity council said the "net effect of this legislation would be to substantially undermine the private equity industry which has strengthened and made more competitive hundreds of companies and returned more than &# billion in profits to pension funds endowments foundations and other investors in the past years " brody mullins and john harwood contributed to this article
