broadcom is just seeking fair competition your june editorial "patent bending" castigating the u s international trade commission decision on the remedy for qualcomms infringement of broadcoms intellectual property misses two key points broadcom a major u s technology innovator is trying to protect its i p and qualcomm holds the keys to resolution here as a verizon official noted in the san diego union tribune "we hold qualcomm accountable to resolve this issue its their issue " we agree qualcomms products have now been found to infringe four broadcom patents three of them willfully and we believe they may infringe a number of others yet qualcomm which collects about &# billion a year from licensing its own patent portfolio and itself uses the itc as a forum refuses to provide appropriate compensation for the use of our i p qualcomm claims that doing so would have a potential negative impact on its "business model " which translated means that it does not want a competitor like broadcom to enter a very large market and compete fairly on the merits of our technology and products as we do with every other semiconductor company in the world lost in the editorial was any sense of the change taking place in the cell phone industry which is migrating from an older standard cdma in which qualcomm had a more significant share of the relevant intellectual property to next generation standards in which qualcomm has a much smaller share of the total ip content in the "new" cell phone world cell phones do much more than just make calls they integrate multiple communications modes audio and visual content and other features for which broadcom has a broad and deep history of innovation and investment in intellectual property indeed contrary to your implication broadcom does not just hold a few key cellular patents we have invested more than &# billion over the past few years in r&amp d harnessed the talent of more than a thousand engineers and made strategic acquisitions in a very concerted effort to meet the demands of this dynamic new market our efforts have resulted in leading edge g cellular chips with advanced features that have already shipped abroad and are ready to ship in the u s in the evolving global marketplace where many products are manufactured offshore the itc plays a critical role in protecting u s property rights such as broadcoms qualcomm general counsel louis lupin has openly derided the effectiveness of any district court infringement injunction telling the journal that an injunction would have little effect on qualcomm because nearly all of its sales of cellphone chips take place outside of the u s and therefore out of the reach of u s court rulings here the itc has constructed a balanced solution based in part on the recommendations of its staff following months of exhaustive study mountains of evidence and two days of hearings the decision takes into account the possible impact on public heath and safety competitive conditions in the u s economy and the effects on u s consumers the compromise order "sufficiently ameliorates this impact such that the orders should be issued " the itc said indeed analysts predict that the order will affect less than of the new cell phone model introductions for the year those companies so quick to denigrate the itc and its june decision are so myopically focused on even this slightest impact to their near term bottom lines that they have lost sight of the bigger picture effective patent enforcement promotes innovation innovation drives competition and fair competition is good for america a presidential veto of the itcs thoroughly considered remedy would deal a serious blow to americas competitive advantage david a dull senior vice president business affairs &amp general counsel broadcom corp irvine calif
