pursuits books a modest rebellion modern feminisms compulsory coarseness spurs a backlash girls gone mild by wendy shalit random house pages &# it is by now almost impossible for anyone to deny some acquaintance with the phrase "girls gone wild " it is the unavoidable title of a video series in which one must rely here in part on the candor of male friends college girls drink too much bare their breasts and go all kinds of wild for the cameras usually during an artless attempt at vacation fun what possesses young women to act this way its a good question here we are decades after the feminist revolution and yet crude self display of a kind that makes the daring of the s seem quaint is considered something that a "normal" college girl might eagerly choose to do for a stranger with a camera and a release form what is going on "we continually malign the good girl as repressed " notes wendy shalit "while the bad girl is wrongly perceived as intrinsically expressing her individuality and somehow proving her sexuality " and indeed the bad girl image revealing clothes a willingness to engage in casual sex a glorification of the inner "bitch" is strangely popular these days it is the kind of daring post feminist pose presented as liberated and free of gender stereotyping that shows up in music videos racy advertisements gossip columns and celebrity profiles think of lindsay lohan on even a good day it is not hard to find versions of the bad girl image in the hallways of the average american high school luckily ms shalit argues a rebellion is under way in "girls gone mild " she claims that more and more young women today put off by our hypersexualized culture are reverting to an earlier idea of femininity they wear modest clothing and even act with unbrazen kindness they dont mind abstinence programs at school and they prefer a version of feminism based on self respect rather than sex performance parity they also take matters into their own hands when craven adults neglect to object to the objectionable take year old ella gunderson in she wrote a letter to nordstrom the department store chain complaining that its denim jeans were too revealing "as it happened the gundersons were helping to put on a local pure fashion show featuring modest clothing " ms shalit writes ellas letter along with nordstroms apologetic reply was included in the shows press kit national media attention soon followed nordstrom apparently shamed eventually started marketing "modern and modest" clothes for girls and pure fashion a loose confederation of like minded young women has since grown from a church basement phenomenon to force that stores study to see what girls consider hip yet modest in a similar spirit a group of pittsburgh girls in boycotted their local abercrombie &amp fitch as a way of protesting the t shirts on sale there like the one with this charming message emblazoned on the chest "who needs brains when you have these " the group called a press conference announced their purpose began getting attention and eventually induced abercrombie to pull its coarsest designs tellingly the national organization for women invited the pittsburgh girls to one of their conferences to honor them for "taking action " but the girls themselves were put off by what they saw there as one of them put it "i support equality and would never like to be controlled by a man but the now conference was more like a brainwashing feminist summit than anything else they had this artistic performance that was so much about sex and how much all men suck it made me feel sick " ms shalit has little patience for the thinking of the older generation of mainstream feminists they are she says "so committed to the idea of casual sex as liberation that they cant appreciate or even quite understand these younger feminists " to them modesty is a step back even a betrayal of the liberationist spirit "they dont understand " ms shalit says "that pursuing crudeness is the problem not the solution " ms shalit is in a good position to speak on such matters as an undergraduate at williams college she caused an uproar by objecting to the schools coed bathrooms in she wrote "a return to modesty discovering the lost virtue " based on the response to that book she later launched the online community modestly yours and began hearing from girls everywhere in "girls gone mild " ms shalit samples from her online exchanges there is a certain poignancy to what she hears "i am twenty nine " one girl writes "and i still resent that stupid teen narrative that claims its natural and typical to have sex and mess with drugs and alcohol among other things when youre a teen whatever why is it so bad to be good when did doing the right thing become wrong and when did getting drunk and doing drugs become a benchmark of the supposed awesomeness of our teen years i just do not think that one has to do a little dirt in order to have a meaningful and authentic teenage experience im not saying i never messed up but according to friends i was still a goody two shoes " inevitably ms shalit offers glimpses of the eroticized culture that she deplores from a celebration of "empowering" nakedness in marie claire magazine to "the hookup handbook " from sex packed teen novels to the web site of the american library association which links to the site "sex etc " where high schoolers can learn about anal sex "some people find it very pleasurable " the site advises "some people dont " it is such casual permissiveness that pushes so many of the people ms shalit interviews to find another way of conducting their lives one group of students at st louis university is so sick of seeing "the vagina monologues" that they mount a protesting counter event one that tries to present in their own words "the true mystery and beauty of the whole female person " what does this all add up to one would like to believe that such protests together with growing doubts about the sexualized culture and growing networks of support for more traditional ways are a groundswell of good but it is hard to say by ms shalits own account we are surrounded by excess that is justified by an ethos of "empowerment " and many of the figures in her book are admirable precisely because they have the pluck to counter a nearly overwhelming majority force "girls gone mild" loses some of its own force when it moves from reportorial survey to advice and advocacy at the end of every chapter are "how to" boxes obviously aimed at young readers on such subjects as taking back your college dorm room when your roommate planning a tryst wants to send you into exile another "confronting your baby boomer parent" tells you how to explain yourself to parents who think that youre "weird for being a virgin " a box called "a recipe for pleasing with integrity" asks "is there a way for a young woman to impress others without having to be mean or compromise her value system " why yes bake an apple pie one would certainly like to see a return to time honored ideas of goodness and homemade desserts but something is needed beyond such self help advice and spirited cheerleading if the young are indeed crying out for a change "girls gone mild" documents their first wave of counter rebellion and good for ms shalit for pulling together so many examples but thats a big "if " ms catton is cultural editor of the new york sun
