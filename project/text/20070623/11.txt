the watchdog agency greater oversight over market manipulation the proposal comes as momentum gains in congress for more stringent oversight of energy markets particularly over the counter or otc and hedge fund trading the new rule would seek to tighten by making it more explicit commission regulation which requires that a person holding or controlling a futures or option position must keep records and make them available to the commission upon request it also would aim to make the regulation clearer and more complete with respect to hedging activity the cftc said in its summary of the new rule "the purpose of the amendments is to enhance the commissions ability to deter and prevent price manipulation or any other disruptions to the integrity of the regulated futures markets to ensure the avoidance of systemic risk and to clarify the meaning of the regulation " the cftc said the proposal "includes executed over the counter exempt commercial markets exempt boards of trade foreign boards of trade and electronic trading " said david gary a cftc spokesman "its anybody and everybody who trades a reportable position from hedge funds or ma and pa " "it makes explicit whats already implicit " mr gary said industry experts say the new democratic controlled congress would likely have the votes to establish oversight of the unregulated otc energy market although oil prices

fund activity in natural gas and i think funds are all going to be watching this closely to see how this pertains to them " he said "if they start pulling hedge fund managers before senate committees i think itll change the way they trade and the size of their positions " limits on otc activity could move more trading to the floor which could bring about a substantial increase in the markets
