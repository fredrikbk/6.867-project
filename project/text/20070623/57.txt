pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings what young audiences want has goldstar events cracked the code new york the under crowd is the holy grail of every fine arts performing group and presenter in america everybody wants it but nobody knows where to find it "every year expeditions went out holy grailing and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for them " mark twain wrote in "a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court " "there was worlds of reputation in it but no money " now though it looks like somebody has finally found the money goldstar events a california based online company that sells half price tickets to live performances in boston chicago las vegas los angeles new york san diego san francisco and washington is successfully reaching young audiences with personalized web based marketing techniques that match buyers with events to become a goldstar member you go to www goldstarevents com and fill out a simple seven question form that asks you to choose your favorite kinds of entertainment from this list classic rock classical music comedy family film jazz popular music spas and massage social events sports theater and two catch all categories "performing arts" and "unique ideas " thats it theres no membership fee goldstar makes its money by adding a small service charge to each ticket you then receive a weekly e newsletter listing available performances in your area along with special last minute email offers tickets are bought online and picked up at the box office at the time of the show goldstars slogan is "great nights out for about the price of a movie " thats a neat capsule summary of what it seeks to do by offering its members an ultraconvenient way to purchase heavily discounted surplus tickets to undersold performances and by sending them custom tailored weekly e mailings touting a wide ranging variety of events the company hopes to attract young people who arent yet in the habit of attending live performances nor are its discounted offerings second class goldstars venue partners include such well known groups as arena stage in washington berkeley repertory theatre the boston celtics the chicago bulls chicago shakespeare the los angeles philharmonic the new york city ballet the new york philharmonic the san francisco opera and chicagos steppenwolf theatre and does it work absolutely goldstar events now has members two thirds of whom are under the age of and go to the movies at least once a month of them do not buy season tickets or subscriptions to any performing group moreover goldstars younger members are far more ethnically diverse than the average big city fine arts ticket buyer "our venue partners tell us that they always know when theyre putting on a goldstar evening " says goldstar ceo jim mccarthy "all they have to do is look at the audience more color and fewer gray heads " goldstar members are in short precisely the sorts of people that performing arts groups dream of reaching and the company knows a lot about what they like each time you purchase a goldstar ticket you receive a postshow email asking you to evaluate the event you saw this gives the company a fast growing user preference database that it uses to evaluate the popularity of its offerings in addition goldstar polls its members on a regular basis and the most recent survey conducted in may speaks volumes about the fast changing entertainment habits of the internet generation by margins ranging from substantial to overwhelming under goldstar members feel that going to the movies is "easier" and "more convenient" than attending live performances prefer buying tickets online and strongly prefer not to buy them over the phone own ipods and prefer purchasing songs "one at a time" to buying entire albums use tivos and other digital video recorders to view tv programs at a time of their own choosing trust web site user reviews far more than print media reviews by "major local columnists " according to goldstar "more than of respondents said negative user reviews on a web site would strongly discourage them from seeing a show this is about times more respondents than would be discouraged by a bad columnists review " feel little or no "sense of obligation to support important arts and cultural institutions with ticket dollars " not surprisingly goldstar has responded to this survey by adding a user review feedback feature to its web site it goes live today but what about performing arts organizations what lesson can they learn from goldstar members the answer is as loud and clear as the fat ladys high c if you want to keep your doors open in the st century youd better scrap the cultural entitlement mentality that has long dominated the marketing of the arts in america and start trying out new business models that make sense to postmodern audiences when it comes to the fine arts young people want what they want when they want it and if they cant get it theyll go see a movie instead mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
