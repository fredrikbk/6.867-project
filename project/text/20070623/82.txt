the weekend interview with mario vargas llosa storyteller lima peru this is a story that often repeated itself " mario vargas llosa says "if a father was a businessman he was a man who had to be complicit with the dictatorship it was the only way to prosper right and what happens is that the son discovers it the son is young restless idealistic believes in justice and liberty and he finds out that his vile father is serving a dictatorship that assassinates incarcerates censors and is corrupted to the bone " mr vargas llosa could have plucked this scenario from his personal recollections of living under dictatorial rule in peru but he tells this story to make a more universal point dictatorships poison everything in their grasp from political institutions right down to relationships between fathers and sons when i meet mr vargas llosa in his home in lima i am not surprised to find that the world famous novelist is a natural storyteller he speaks to me in spanish gripping his black rimmed glasses in his hand and occasionally waving them around for emphasis mr vargas llosas bold ideas and expressive language may make him one of latin americas finest writers "aunt julia and the scriptwriter " "the time of the hero" and "conversation in the cathedral" are just a few of his classic works but those same traits didnt necessarily serve him well at the polls after running for president of peru in and losing to alberto fujimori mr vargas llosa decided to devote his full attention to writing he now lives in lima for about three months of the year spending the rest of his time in europe "i am not going to participate in professional politics again " he says and he doesnt have to mr vargas llosa has found an effective way to expose the destructive nature of dictatorships while underscoring the importance of individual liberty and free will he just picks up his pen "words are acts " he says echoing jean paul sartre "through writing one can change history " during the presidential campaign mr varga llosa emphasized the need for a market economy privatization free trade and above all the dissemination of private property he didnt exactly receive a welcome reception "it was a very different era because to speak of private property private enterprise the market it was sacrilegious " he says "i was fairly vulnerable in that campaign " he continues "because i didnt lie i said exactly what we were going to do it was a question of principle and also i thought it would be impossible to do liberal radical reforms without having the mandate to do them " now almost years later the landscape looks very different mr vargas llosa explains that he was propelled into politics when then president alan garcia at the time a socialist and a populist attempted to nationalize the banks today he is running the country again but "now the same alan garcia is the champion of capitalism in peru " mr vargas llosa laughs merrily "its funny no " he is relatively upbeat about latin america today "im not as pessimistic as others who believe that latin america has returned to the time of populism leftism " the region has its problems to be sure one major one coming from caracas in the form of venezuelan president hugo chavez but according to mr vargas llosa perhaps what is most remarkable is what mr chavez has not been able to do "we have a big problem with chavez " mr vargas llosa admits "hes a demagogue and a th century socialist he is a destabilizing force for democracy in latin america but what he thought would be so easy hasnt been so easy there has been a lot of resistance " one of mr chavezs major errors was his refusal last month to renew the license of popular radio caracas television or rctv "international hostility was enormous " mr vargas llosa notes "for me most important was that the protests in venezuela were very strong in particular the sectors that were once very sympathetic to him for example the students in the central university of venezuela not only the students in the private universities " it is such infringements of free speech that highlight why in places like latin america reading a good novel can be much more than just a pleasant way to spend an afternoon "i think in countries where basic problems are still unresolved where a society remains so traumatized by deep conflicts as in latin america or in third world countries in general the novel is not only a form of entertainment but it substitutes for something that these societies are not accustomed to seeing information for example " mr vargas llosa says "if you live in a country where there is nothing comparable to free information often literature becomes the only way to be more or less informed about whats going on " literature can also be a form of resistance perhaps the only way to express discontent in the absence of political parties this all sounds true enough but in a dictatorship wouldnt literature be censored as well "in undeveloped countries censorship doesnt reach that point of subtlety as it did in spain for example " mr vargas llosa explains "because in undeveloped countries the dictators are well functioning illiterates that dont think that literature can be dangerous " to give one example mr vargas llosas first novel "the time of the hero " about life at a military school in lima was burned publicly in peru by a military dictatorship in the s but the authorities apparently didnt find the book enough of a political threat to ban it outright and in the end it was mr vargas llosa who reaped the benefits of the public burning "it became a best seller " he exclaims laughing there is another disturbing current in mr vargas llosas work that is less often discussed mistreatment of women ranging from disrespect to outright violence the abuses are particularly horrifying in "the feast of the goat " a novel based on the life of rafael trujillo the dictator who terrorized the dominican republic from to mr vargas llosa describes traveling to the dominican republic and being stunned to hear stories of peasants offering their own daughters as "gifts" to the lustful tyrant trujillo and his sons he tells me could abuse any woman of any social class with absolute impunity the situation in the dominican republic which he refers to as a "laboratory of horrors " may have tended toward the extreme but it underscores a larger trend "the woman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship " mr vargas llosa discovered that this phenomenon was hardly limited to latin america "i went to iraq after the invasion " he tells me "when i heard stories about the sons of saddam hussein it seemed like i was in the dominican republic hearing stories about the sons of trujillo that women would be taken from the street put in automobiles and simply presented like objects the phenomenon was very similar even with such different cultures and religions " he concludes "brutality takes the same form in dictatorial regimes " did this mean that mr vargas llosa supported the invasion of iraq "i was against it at the beginning " he says but then he went to iraq and heard accounts of life under saddam hussein "because there has been so much opposition to the war already one forgets that this was one of the most monstrous dictatorships that humanity has ever seen comparable to that of hitler or stalin " he changed his mind about the invasion "iraq is better without saddam hussein than with saddam hussein without a doubt " mr vargas llosas broad visceral hatred of dictatorships in part stems from personal experience in particular growing up in s peru under the dictatorship of manuel odria "all the political parties were prohibited there was strict censorship of radio and the press " he explains "the university had many professors in exile and many student prisoners this is the atmosphere in which a boy of my generation entered adulthood " this period is the backdrop for "conversation in the cathedral " which mr vargas llosa said would be the work that he would rescue from a fire the brilliant four volume novel rarely addresses odria directly rather zooming in on relationships between ordinary peruvians from all levels of society with unembellished prose mr vargas llosa plunges you right into the heart of a nation without hope "its a novel in which i wanted to show what i lived through in through in those years how the dictatorship didnt limit itself to censorship or prohibiting political life no " mr vargas llosa tells me "the dictatorship created a system that impregnated every act of life " and herein lies the power of mr vargas llosas work he finds that tyranny takes its toll in places we hadnt even thought to look as for the value of freedom perhaps he puts it best in "the feast of the goat" "it must be nice your cup of coffee or glass of rum must taste better the smoke of your cigar a swim in the ocean on a hot day the movie you see on saturday the merengue on the radio everything must leave a more pleasurable sensation in your body and spirit when you had what trujillo had taken away from dominicans years ago free will " we begin to wrap up our interview we both drink red wine a room nearby houses mr vargas llosas private library i notice that some of the volumes are bound in leather he tells me that there are more than books his collection is clearly a point of pride but it is also a tangible representation of his belief in the power of words or as he would say it "i think that literature has the important effect of creating free independent critical citizens who cannot be manipulated " ms parker is assistant editorial features editor at the wall street journal
