pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies buy rent or toss not everythings a keeper a dvd collectors guide an email from a reader showed up recently under the subject line "column idea" "i own quite a few dvds my wife thinks this is crazy since we can rent films when we want to watch them i myself have come to realize that only a handful of my films are viewed more than once but that handful is actually viewed often the others now feel like a waste of space and money what makes a film worth owning rather than renting " thats a column idea after my own heart i own quite a few dvds too nearly a thousand of them sit on inch deep shelves in a dedicated walk in dvd closet off the living room as dozens more arrive unbidden each week the closet keeps overflowing onto the dining room table and the kitchen counter so i keep organizing the overflow into piles of keepers and tossers except that the keeper pile grows so fast that most of those get tossed too here are a few of the principles that guide my efforts to prevail over clutter redundancy and excess in my collection great filmmakers neednt be represented by all of their films which hitchcocks to keep for example not "rear window " "dial m for murder " "the birds " "rope" or "lifeboat " they were fascinating in their time but now they seem mechanical or schematic with no more surprises to offer up my life wont be poorer if i never again watch jimmy stewart in that wheelchair grace kelly on the phone or tippi hedren beset by those damned crows even "psycho" has lost its charge because by now we know its infernally clever secret all too well but ive kept and will happily revisit "notorious" for its elegant performances is anything more painful than cary grants scorn for ingrid bergman "north by northwest" for its bravura set pieces "thats funny " the farmer says to cary grant "there are no crops to be dusted" and "vertigo" for its psychological intricacy francois truffaut also admired the fact that kim novak didnt wear a brassiere when a bravura set piece occurs in a movie thats less than the sum of its parts keep the movie and enjoy the pleasurable part two steven spielberg films make that point "" is overall an awful mess but the u s o jitterbug sequence stands and swirls as the essence of big screen joy it also looks wonderful on my biggish plasma screen i just checked "indiana jones and the temple of doom" has come to be considered a downer but the mine cart roller coaster stuff ranks with some of the best action sequences ever put on film a chaplin feature reinforces the point no one would or rather should accuse "the great dictator" of being a fully realized comedy but it stays on my shelf so i can watch jack oakies take off on mussolini and chaplins version of hitler adenoid hynkel dancing with a globe of the world or for that matter chaplins jewish barber giving a bald headed customer a shave keep mysteries for their mysteriousness not for their plots thus "the big sleep" not just mysterious but famously unfathomable is more of a keeper than another fine bogart film "the maltese falcon " billy wilder and raymond chandler did brilliant work in the justly lionized "double indemnity " but having seen it so often over the years i dont need a dvd to see again the atmospherics of "touch of evil " on the other hand and the seductively psychologically mysterious "chinatown" keep bestowing new rewards so does francis coppolas "the conversation " a mystery that sounds as good as it looks intricate ideas trump big bombastic or deep ones "my dinner with andre" is a renewable resource even though its only a conversation between two men sitting at a restaurant table its also a scintillating dialectic between andre gregorys quest for transcendence and wally shawns advocacy of simple limited pleasures but ive tossed the dvds because one sitting is enough in the case of such ostensible classics as "last year at marienbad " "the pawnbroker" or "network " keep foreign films for as tautological as it may seem their foreignness not their famousness or picturesqueness "diva" is a pretty toy and essentially trivial but an inimitably french confection of mystery and cultural whimsy truffauts "jules and jim" is famous and deservedly so but what makes it a treasure ill always keep is its peerless evocation of three complex europeans in a vanished bohemian era luchino viscontis "the leopard" is full of visual splendors but its greatness lies in its recapitulation of the drama and turbulence of italys risorgimento i wouldnt be unhappy if i never saw godards "contempt" again for the reference point of its comedy is vulgar international filmmakers making vulgar international films but godards first feature "breathless " in which the hero imitates bogart has a place of honor on one of my inch shelves no other film has ever captured its insouciant ironic and romantic french take on the american gangster genre but now duty calls steve the fedex guy whos also a stunt man and the son of an important english comedy writer has just brought a bunch of new dvds ive got to figure out what to do with them morgensterns picks three worth owning collectors crave order as witness the scene in "diner" when shrevie admonishes beth about keeping his records in alphabetical plus categorical order the filing system for my dvds is a work in perpetual progress but a few films including these three sit together as perfect exemplars of their directors careers annie hall weve been through thick and increasing thin with woody allen so its instructive as well as touching and enjoyable to revisit this peerless american comedy and see how fine it really was and how beautifully lyrically simple diane keaton was its all there for the savoring woodys nebbishness unspoiled by the ravages of time his hypochondria his fear and loathing of california annies deep unease with lobsters and marshall mcluhan coming out from behind the poster at the new yorker theater on upper broadway ill even watch the movie to see the theater which was my neighborhood theater in a previous lifetime the double life of veronique volumes have been written about krzysztof kieslowski the director and co writer of this mysteriously poetic film and understandably though not always understandably so the movie medium has never known a more original thinker or a more confident stylist "the double life of veronique" is a double dose of those qualities irene jacob plays weronika a soprano in a polish choir and her double veronique a french music teacher although neither woman is aware of the other they are connected to one another by ineffable emotional bonds if that sounds intimidating rest assured that the movie is as beautiful as it is abstruse monsoon wedding mira nair loves her native india thats a given but she also loves detail and texture colors and crowds and swirl all of that comes together in "monsoon wedding " a comical musical and fondly satirical film about an upwardly mobile punjabi family in modern new delhi the key word here is a punjabi word that i learned from the production notes distributed at the first screening masti or the intoxicating zest for life its the quality that infuses everything ms nair has done from "salaam bombay " in to last years "the namesake "
