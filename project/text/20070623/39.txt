politics &amp economics obama unveils overhaul plan for white house ethics rules democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama hammered on what he considers a defining theme of his campaign and a soft spot for one of his key rivals unveiling a package of executive office ethics reforms he promised to enact if he wins the white house at a speech in manchester n h friday mr obama called for barring political appointees from lobbying the white house after leaving its employ ending the awarding of almost all no bid contracts and increasing public access to administration records the white house currently bars ex political appointees from lobbying the administration for one year "its time to renew a peoples politics in this country to ensure that the hopes and concerns of average americans speak louder in washington than the hallway whispers of high priced lobbyists " mr obama said nominally the comments were aimed at the bush administration which has been criticized for awarding sweetheart contracts to political patrons and cloaking its activities in secrecy more subtly the illinois senator also seemed to be taking a dig at fellow democrats ethics reform was a major rallying cry in the democratic campaign to take over control of congress last year but the new leaders on capitol hill seem to have lost some of their fervor for housecleaning now that they are in power mr obamas speech was also a subtle dig at new york sen hillary rodham clinton current front runner for the democratic nomination mrs clintons husband famously promised at the beginning of his presidency "the most ethical administration in history " only to be consumed by myriad scandals some touching the then first lady mr obama has touted his record of support for ethics reform a record he says goes back to his time at the illinois statehouse the clinton campaign declined to comment the clinton campaign has advanced its own government ethics platform one that appears to be less stringent and less detailed than the one mr obama is proposing for example while mr obama proposes banning all ex political appointees from lobbying the administration mrs clintons ban would extend only to cabinet members similarly while mr obama says he would ban no bid contracts over &# mrs clinton simply says she would end "abuse" of such contracts the one up platform dueling is likely to escalate as candidates such as mrs clinton and mr obama jostle to highlight their differences in a race where big issues such as the iraq war reveal very little daylight between them both lead in fund raising and in the polls similar efforts to differentiate from the herd have begun cropping up recently among several of the lower tier and minor democratic candidates mr obamas ethics offensive began earlier this week when he made public the list of "earmark" projects that he has placed into congressional spending bills earmarks are generally brick and mortar projects that members of congress insert into spending bills to help constituents in their district or state the practice is as anonymous as it is ubiquitous virtually all members embed earmarks into spending bills and authors are not required to identify themselves critics such as bush administration officials decry the practices as wasteful pork government watchdog groups say the practice of using anonymous earmarks to clot spending bills is rife with abuse and is often used to reward political backers or even to extort kickbacks from unethical beneficiaries most lawmakers have declined to make public the list of earmarks they have sponsored over the years but mr obama in a departure from most of his colleagues released a list of earmarks and has called for ending the practice of keeping them anonymous mrs clinton has so far declined to do the same
