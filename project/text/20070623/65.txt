the year old orlando fla resident called revolve to ask for a similar discount final price &# with free shipping thrown in "it would be a pain" to do this at the mall she says for all its advances the

but draws the line at off "anything beyond is a pretty extreme discount " says mike karanikolas co owner of revolve clothing "we potentially are starting to lose money at that point " tales of haggling successes and tips are appearing on shopping discussion boards last week rebecca ryan posted a triumphant tale on beauty and fashion web site makeupalley com she says she convinced active
