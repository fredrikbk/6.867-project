hot topic mike bloombergs money lets face it theres one overriding reason anyone is talking about michael bloomberg running for president it isnt new york citys real estate boom budget surpluses or his political philosophy its his money mayor bloomberg in his regular denials that he intends to run for president likes to note that a "short jewish divorced billionaire" doesnt sound very electable were not sure how important the first three traits are but the last far from disqualifying him is the main reason behind the bloomberg boomlet unlike most other american politicians he is rich enough to finance his own independent presidential campaign and thanks to our campaign finance laws hes a rare candidate who doesnt have to raise money in hundreds of &# or smaller increments prior to the campaign finance "reforms" of the s and mccain feingold of it was possible for a political maverick like eugene mccarthy to mount a campaign with the money of a couple of well heeled backers these days a stewart mott or jack dreyfus could only advance their views by running themselves this is not progress weve had three decades worth of scolds talking about the need to get money out of politics but the only result has been to force that money into different and often less transparent channels no one seriously thought "clean gene" mccarthy was being bought by messrs mott and dreyfus and in any case their support was known and public for all to see now thanks to campaign finance reform we have replaced fat cat donors with fat cat candidates and the political machines of the likes of fat cat george soros we dont begrudge mr bloomberg a cent of his money and he should be free to spend all of it on politics if he wishes including on a run for president the supreme court has said he has that right but no one has so far explained why its fine for mr bloomberg to advance his own political career using his personal fortune but it would be "dirty" for him to bankroll someone else who shared his agenda as long as voters knew where the money came from theyd be free to decide whether it tainted the candidate or not such donations could be posted instantly on the internet it is often said that billionaires should not be able to "buy" elections and that strict donation limits weed out candidates without a broad base of support but now a billionaire really can buy an election in the sense that he is unrestrained by the limits imposed on everyone else mr bloomberg spent an estimated &# million on his two mayoral campaigns literally overwhelming his competitors with tv ads restricting billionaires to financing themselves far from increasing political competition has reduced it barack obama has defied conventional wisdom by raising enough money to compete with hillary and bill clintons campaign juggernaut but the rest of the democratic field is less fortunate surely chris dodd senator from the hedge fund capital of the world could find some wealthy backers for his campaign if the rules permitted it the money would hardly guarantee him success but it would give him a fighting chance to put his agenda on the table leaving voters to decide whether they liked what they heard the same goes for new mexico governor bill richardson a candidate of significant experience who is struggling to raise enough money because he comes from a small state and is less well known than his competitors mr bloomberg has recently complained about the dearth of good presidential candidates presumably one reason he may take the independent plunge wed like to see him acknowledge that one reason for that dearth is that a short jewish divorced billionaire cant write a check larger than &# to anyone but himself
