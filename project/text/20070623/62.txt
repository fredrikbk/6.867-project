pursuits recreation how to win a marathon well at least how to nab a trophy for your mantel as races dole out more prizes and the web makes it easier to scope out the competition more amateurs are perfecting the art of finding the easy win according to usa cycling the sports governing body i am a no cyclist im not the top cyclist in the u s that would be a guy named jonathan page nor am i the champ in new york city or in the borough of manhattan or even in the midtown section of manhattan where i live but i am the no cyclist at my skill level out of four total in the zip code a roughly one square mile area bordered by central park to the north and times square to the south similarly terry walts likes to tell his friends hes the defending champion of georgias summer sizzler triathlon his secret he did enough research to figure out the course would be easy and the field fairly small in fact he turned out to be the only person in his age category as competitive amateur athletics explode a new form of gamesmanship is emerging millions of people can now say theyve run a marathon or a triathlon but how many people can say theyve won one in the past that hasnt been easy for weekend warriors who work long hours at the office and lack six pack abs now some are trying to gain an edge by finding where the fast racers arent instead of training harder theyre spending hours online to scout out the field and theyre driving hundreds of miles to race against thin competition in out of the way places is the chicago triathlon which is expecting participants this year too daunting for you well theres always the triathlon at rigby lake in rigby idaho seventy four people took part last may the races first year another option the god bless america triathlon in wautoma wis which attracted seven people last year when it started and this year is advertising itself as perfect for beginners and "the semi pro who wants to blaze a course " of course some people cherry pick their races simply because they feel more comfortable running jumping and swimming with similarly love handled weekend warriors but there is a growing cottage industry pandering not so much to the desire to participate but to the more ruthless urge to win new web sites closely track results of thousands of races down to local kilometer charity runs athletes are using this information to find out how tough the competition is likely to be in a race based on previous years the sites also keep tabs on amateur athletes in ever greater detail from the names of racers and their past performances to the fastest people of a certain age in a particular zip code this makes it easier than ever to find out how you stack up against your neighbors some of jack weixels most important race preparation takes place in his home office where he sits in a leather executive chair trolling the internet on the walls are photos of himself running triathlons including a series of photos that shows the progression of his weight loss from when he started three years ago during triathlon season which runs from spring to fall in and around walnut creek calif the software salesman spends at least an hour every day searching for data on competitors and races in which he might be able to place well he often googles the terms "triathlon" and "flat" at pounds he says hilly courses are a challenge mr weixel has yet to come in first in a race but he has won medals this way if he knows from his research that a key competitor is stronger in swimming but weaker in biking and running he might save his strength while swimming the first leg letting the other guy gain and then try to blow by him on the bike in the second leg or on foot in the third in april he came in a close second in his age group in the moraga treeline triathlon in moraga calif a race he picked in part because it was scheduled a week before the more popular wildflower triathlon also a friend tipped him off that races on university campuses while very competitive for those to years old are poorly attended by people in their late s next year mr weixel plans to race the stanford triathlon "stanford has a very flat campus " he says for some weekend warriors such strategies violate a core principle of competitive sports going up against people at least as good as you makes you better the practice can be particularly disheartening for people who assume that their local races are well local and then they wind up getting thumped by a carpetbagger nicholas bernice a science teacher at northern highlands regional high school in allendale n j had dreams of winning his schools annual kilometer charity run where the bulk of the racers tend to be faculty staff and students toward the end of the race he was passed by a few serious looking runners he didnt recognize one of those runners was michael conforti a teachers boyfriend who owns a local running shop called sneaker factory mr conforti had planned simply to jog alongside his girlfriend but when he lined up at the start he looked around and realized he had a good chance of winning if he tried as he set out mr conforti says he began "picking off" inexperienced high school runners who started out too fast it wasnt until he passed the school band and heard its cheers for mr bernice that he realized he was about to defeat the beloved and exhausted science teacher mr bernice set a personal record but mr conforti won the race "people were upset with me " he says races are also getting more generous with prizes parsing achievement into ever more granular levels fields are now routinely split into five year age groups each of which has a winner trophies or medals are awarded to fourth and fifth place finishers too categories for heavyset competitors "athena" for females and "clydesdale" for males give an edge to tall people who tend to weigh more than shorter people james longhurst drove miles to compete in the buckeye lake triathlon in millersport ohio last year he had scoped it out and determined it had only about participants compared to the nearly people who usually compete in the wendys international triathlon race just outside columbus he finished third out of seven in his to age group earning him a spot at the postrace medal ceremony "i screamed out loud " he says "i just dont tell anyone there were only seven people " mr longhurst says cherry picking races gives him his only shot for coming in first the history professor in new concord ohio says the demands of his job and family dont allow him to train as rigorously as full time athletes "theyre pros " he says "they have body fat and a &# bike im a recreational triathlete " race organizers say they have no way of identifying competitors who deliberately choose easy races its also not against the rules rob beeler the organizer of a triathlon outside indianapolis that is heavily attended by beginners says he still invites experienced triathlon clubs to take part in the race even though he knows theyll probably sail to victory "we want to attract as many people as we can " he says i discovered i was no by chance a few months ago while i was looking on the web site of usa cycling the group started posting results of races and individual rankings in in response to cyclists saying they wanted see to how they measure up against their rivals race organizers voluntarily submit the results and usa cycling keeps updated rankings of registered cyclists based on geography age and skill level mike halovitch a cycling buddy of mine chose another route to the top in november he entered and won an "ironman" triathlon in the bahamas the ironman is an elite long distance triathlon that only a handful of people can claim to have won what mr halovitch doesnt tell a lot of people is that the bahamian race while modeled after official ironman races was not sanctioned by the world triathlon corp and only seven other people participated to find a race where the odds of a win are high start with a little internet sleuthing sites like coolrunning com and trifind com list results for thousands of obscure races and triathlons around the country results are generally good indicators of what to expect the next time around especially since some athletes return to the same race year after year if youre looking to gauge the toughness of a race its also a good idea to use these sites to research your competitors you can find more information about racers by looking them up online or searching the databases of sites that track them athlinks com for example has information on more than nine million athletes and races also look for whether the race results are divided up by age group the more age groups the better chance you have at taking home a trophy and see what the winning time was in your category four years ago troy busot started the site that has since become athlinks com the amateur triathlete cultivates relationships with race organizers to get them to send him results that he then crunches and posts the site sends regular email updates about competitors performances he says the pros also suss out their competition "you take guys like lance armstrong they know what their main rivals are doing " he says for years amateurs didnt get much notice beyond praise from their friends or families even when race results began appearing on the internet sites werent always updated frequently or they listed only a small number of races now these sites are turning amateur athletes into local celebrities on slowtwitch com and coolrunning com racers are profiled like the pros in sports illustrated in new york city a popular cycling web site velocitynation com for example posts action shots from amateur races and local cyclists are featured in interviews in which they answer questions about everything from their training routines to their personal lives chris bennett a columnist on track and field site milesplit com says many serious runners who couldnt name the fastest american runner in the meters right now tyson gay could name several people who dominate races in their area "the stars of the sport are people around them when they finish at their local road race " says mr bennett a runner and financial advisor in apex n c wendy abma says entering a race is like being a bridesmaid winning one is being the bride ms abmas home in ridgewood n j is decorated with a half dozen plaques and trophies "where everyone can see them " sometimes shell finish a race and set a personal best but she says coming in first is "more impressive " as an employee of a company that keeps track of times during races ms abma says shes more familiar with many of the courses than other runners and has a leg up in scouting the easier ones her favorite medal is one for a k race she entered because a friend was having trouble finding enough participants after checking the course online to make sure it was flat she registered and later cruised to victory when friends ask about the plaque she doesnt usually mention the skill level of the other racers "you dont always have to mention how you got there " ms abma says for all the thrill of picking up another medal smaller races can present some problems for serious competitors kristina kester is a former college swimmer who has won or placed well in dozens of triathlons but during the swim leg of a triathlon in carrollton ga she had to navigate around flailing swimmers one of whom called for help from a buoy after the first meters she also had to deal with male cyclists jockeying with her for position because they didnt want to be passed by a woman "it makes for a long morning " says ms kester
