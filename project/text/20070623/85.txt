whole foods can sow progress with wild oats in response to your june editorial "granola and antitrust" i agree with you the ftcs effort to redefine the supermarket category is puzzling although whole foods market created stores that are differentiated from other supermarkets consumers arent forced to shop with us they do so out of choice whole foods market has more competition today than ever before in every community where we operate stores merging with wild oats hardly means eliminating competition if eliminating a competitor is inherently "wrong " the ftc should never approve mergers whole foods market has acquired and merged with competitor companies for years in two tiny competitive natural foods companies merged to form whole foods market since then we have purchased different companies in each case we eliminated a competitor and greatly improved the acquired stores i believe the ftc is wrong on these points and others yes this transaction eliminates one competitor however the result will be the opposite of what the ftc claims our merger history shows that wild oats customers will benefit from improved quality better service and lower prices employees will see improved wages and benefits and suppliers will benefit from increased sales to the larger company shareholders will see higher profits and it is hoped a higher stock price john mackey ceo whole foods market austin texas
