the week ahead our take on coming events markets despite the dows rise clouds gather as the quarter closes by justin lahart at the end of any quarter professional investors worry about last minute jolts to their portfolios this time around theyve got more reason to worry than usual the coming week the last of the second quarter is littered with potential pitfalls the federal reserve meets on tuesday and wednesday and although theres a near unanimous consensus that fed policy makers will keep their overnight target rate parked at theres always the chance the statement that comes after the meeting could rattle markets theres the lingering possibility that the trouble at two big bear stearns hedge funds that spooked investors last week could spill more broadly into stocks and bonds the big risk is that a bear or another distressed seller dumps a bunch of illiquid securities on the market pushing prices way down anyone holding the same or similar securities might have to mark down their own portfolios at the end of the quarter hurting their own performance a big chunk of corporate bonds will be hitting the market over the next several weeks and theres some concern over how easily the market can swallow it private equity firms which use debt to finance company purchases have been one of the major factors buoying the market if any of the upcoming bond sales go poorly it will throw the private equity firms ability to easily fund transactions into question and as always the waning days of the quarter are when companies whose upcoming quarterly results wont meet investor expectations tend to confess their sins its been a good quarter though a woolly one with investors nervous about how the housing market was affecting mortgage linked securities at the outset and worried that rising interest rates could stanch the flow of cash into stocks more recently so far this quarter the dow jones industrial average has risen points or to leaving a lot of people with good second quarter scorecards ones that theyd rather not make a hash of in the final round while some decry wall streets focus on short term results believing that it distracts from the bigger picture many fund managers still care immensely about quarterly performance worrying their investors will pull out if it isnt up to snuff while they could opt to sell some stocks and lock in gains most fund managers will instead refrain from much buying or selling at all thinks raymond james strategist jeffrey saut "i think you just go on vacation " he says if hes right the stock market could be more thinly traded than usual since thin markets with fewer buyers and sellers to agree on price tend to be more volatile any jolts in the week ahead could be exacerbated but volatility cuts both up and down one final quarter end dynamic is the games some investors play some mutual fund managers engage in "window dressing " where they gussy up the appearance of their portfolios by selling their worst performing stocks and buying more of their best performers unscrupulous hedge fund managers may buy more of their biggest positions in order to push prices higher a practice known as marking up or painting the tape combine that with expectations that once the confessions are out of the way second quarter results will be strong then investors who sit out the market may be sorry they had thinks seth tobias of new york hedge fund circle t partners "i think you can see a run up to the end of the quarter " he says foreign affairs as blair leaves the stage he promotes his legacy by emily nelson late last year after he announced that he would resign as prime minister tony blair arrived to speak to a labour party group frustrated with his leadership the group applauded as he walked on stage amid the applause mr blair quipped "i havent gone yet " and with that he won over the crowd says rodney barker a professor of government at the london school of economics and political science on wednesday mr blair will indeed go he will tender his resignation as britains prime minister ending a very protracted good bye whatever he does next some reports say an option is becoming a special envoy to the middle east mr blair has subtly but aggressively been trying to defend his record during his last year in office especially in the seven weeks since he set his departure date unpopular among many at home for the war in iraq mr blair is leaving amid a sigh of relief here and the skilled orator is reminding britain of his legacy "hes keen for his version of events to be out in public discourse " says paul richards special adviser to the labour party chair who has written a book looking at mr blairs speeches in public speeches "he always improvises a little in the beginning about the carpet in the room the weather to ease himself into it " "hes one of those politicians who in retrospect will be seen for the achievements he did " mr richards says "in the heat and light of the transfer of power now it is harder " mr blairs speeches have reminded people of his programs to rebuild the welfare state and measures like establishing britains first minimum wage he has been on a whirlwind travel schedule and went through africa to showcase how he has raised issues of global poverty he stopped in freetown the capital of sierra leone where he gave a speech to the army he highlighted that seven years after he had dispatched british troops to intervene and stabilize the country it was democratic with its own army to many in britain it was seen as mr blair reminding that military intervention doesnt always turn out like iraq indeed in a shift mr blair hasnt been defending the decision to join with the u s and invade iraq as a policy or intelligence issue but made an appeal to his efforts to be a good prime minister "i ask you to accept one thing hand on heart i did what i thought was right i may have been wrong thats your call " he said in a may speech setting the date for his departure that said some political scientists think mr blair has been too focused on populist issues like iraq and attacking the press and hasnt spoken of issues like constitutional overhaul that might be his biggest legacy mr blair established a scottish parliament and a welsh assembly elected mayors in major cities including london and a power sharing executive in northern ireland he partially overhauled the house of lords and britain now has a freedom of information act "he has transformed the constitution the state the framing of politics out of all recognition " says patrick dunleavy professor of political science and public policy at the lse "people are not necessarily good judges at what theyve done well or badly " or as mr blair said in a speech "there is a judgment to be made on my premiership and in the end that is for you the people to make " professional sports nbas draft is likely to worsen a talent imbalance by russell adams the national basketball association already reeling from record low television audiences for its playoff finals could take another big hit to its popularity in the coming weeks draft thats because the two best players available greg oden and kevin durant are likely to wind up on teams from the already dominant western conference as a result of a complicated lottery system that determines the draft order the upshot the eastern conference which was swept in the finals in four games just a week ago is likely to become even more irrelevant the growing talent gap between the two conferences could have important financial ramifications for the nba unlike most industries pro sports leagues thrive on competitive balance and are free to engage in some monopolistic practices to maximize it the national football league is the most popular and lucrative u s sport generating some &# billion a year in revenue about twice what the nba brings in partly because of a system that makes it hard for teams to be too good or too bad the worst teams automatically get the first crack at the best college players most of the team revenue is redistributed among franchises and teams payrolls are capped major league baseballs business suffered for years because only a handful of teams were truly competitive changes to the playoff format and the collective bargaining agreement have put many more teams in the playoff mix and fans have responded at the gate the league set a record for its own attendance last year a season in which of the teams were still within five games of a playoff spot with only a month left to play of course the nba also set a league attendance record this season and like the nba mlb has had declines in television audiences for recent world series still the lopsided state of play in the nba is hurting the league this year the western conference had every member of the all nba first team and arguably the leagues five best teams as a result by the time the san antonio spurs emerged from the west to take on the eastern conference champion cleveland cavaliers most fans outside of those two cities had tuned out abcs broadcast of the spurs four game sweep drew an average of of u s homes down from the the miami heat dallas mavericks finals drew last year the for san antonio and the detroit pistons in and the for detroit and the los angeles lakers in while the nba shares revenue among teams and caps player payrolls it lags behind other leagues efforts to create better matchups unlike the nfl national hockey league and mlb the nba doesnt for example shuffle the seeding after each round of the playoffs so that the two best teams remaining dont play each other too early another lingering concern among some teams the team with the worst record not only isnt guaranteed the top pick in the draft but it also has just a chance of landing it thats because of the lottery system that gives all nonplayoff teams a shot at the top pick some team executives are pushing for changes on those fronts stu jackson the leagues executive vice president of basketball operations says the league this summer plans to look into the possibility of reseeding teams after each playoff round but adds that other big changes in this vein arent likely any time soon "the balance within the league tends to be somewhat cyclical " he says world bank zoellick has work cut out for him by deborah solomon when he gets the formal nod monday to become president of the world bank robert zoellick will face challenges ranging from a staff revolt to defining the role of the poverty fighting institution in a global economy where more and more private money is flowing to developing countries but his immediate hurdle will be escaping the shadow of his besmirched predecessor paul wolfowitz who quit following accusations that he secured a pay and promotion package for his girlfriend one early test whom mr zoellick surrounds himself with a major criticism of mr wolfowitz was that he insulated himself with a small coterie of close aides and didnt seek out differing opinions alienating both staff and the banks executive directors who run the institution on behalf of member countries to avoid the pitfalls that befell mr wolfowitz who never overcame his image as an architect of president bushs iraq war mr zoellick is being advised to avoid hiring from the bush political establishment "mr wolfowitz built a little wall around himself in the presidency and put gatekeepers there " says colin bradford a senior fellow at the brookings institution for mr zoellick to succeed he "should want to hear a difference of views and he needs to appoint people from big countries like china " mr zoellick currently a vice chairman at wall street powerhouse goldman sachs is a former bush u s trade representative and deputy secretary of state but isnt one of the wolfowitz neocon crowd he has said hell make staff outreach a priority and work to fix flagging morale another big question mark how aggressively will mr zoellick pursue mr wolfowitzs crackdown on corrupt governments that agenda ran into resistance partly because some world bank insiders and other governments said it detracted from the banks primary goal of ending poverty and because he cut off funds to some governments without consensus from the institution mr zoellick who just returned from a two week world tour to africa europe and latin america before even formally getting the job has said he plans to focus heavily on the poorest countries in africa but with so much private money flowing into distressed economies there hell need to find a way to make sure the institution has an impact "the bank should certainly continue with its work in dealing with the poorest countries in africa but in those countries where other donors are operating the bank needs to carve out where is its specific niche where does it have value " says nancy birdsall president of the center for global development an antipoverty group in washington hell also be wading into a debate about whether the bank should focus solely on lending money in low income countries or to continue working in middle income markets such as china where access to capital is more readily available but many people still live in poverty some argue that since middle income countries have access to loans through commercial banks the world bank should instead devote its funds elsewhere others say that ignoring middle income countries will hurt the world bank by robbing it of those countries expertise in developing their markets and undercut those countries by cutting them off from the institution
