nuke news from north korea yesterdays announcement by u s envoy christopher hill that north korea will shut down its main nuclear reactor at yongbyon must be marked down as good news how long one is able with a straight face to call it good news remains to be seen mr hill acknowledged as much in saying this concession is "burdened by the realization of the fact that were going to have to spend a great deal of time a great deal of effort a lot of work achieving these " this must have been how edmund hillary felt at the base of mt everest though his job was easier mountains dont lie mr hills announcement is a small step toward getting the hermit kingdom to honor its february pledge to disclose all of its nuclear weapons programs and materials by days a deadline that passed two months ago presumably the north koreans balked because they hadnt been able to find any financial institution that would onpass to them the &# million unfrozen by the u s from a bank in macau indeed locking up north koreas overseas assets and shutting off access to the global banking system may have had a lot to do with this small forward step a lesson to remember when dealing with similar intransigents such as iran here however are the truly hard steps ahead on the road to full north korean denuclearization where is the plutonium facility that built the fuel for the nuclear bomb north korea exploded last october where are its plutonium stockpiles where is the enriched uranium program it said it had in and finally the summit where are the a bombs it has already made or where is irrefutable proof that it has never done so yesterdays announcement was just that an announcement mr hill was right not to oversell it
