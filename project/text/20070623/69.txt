ravenous hunger for mosquitoes up to a day he claimed though some scientists say that claim was exaggerated there is no doubt that mr wade engendered widespread human affection for the graceful wide mouthed insect eaters that flock north by the millions each spring from brazil that affection touched off battles in several states over which city could proclaim itself the purple martin capital a designation mr wade said rightfully belonged to his home town of griggsville ill compared by his daughter susan barr to "the p t barnum of the bird world " mr wade would do almost anything to publicize the benefits of the plucky birds he wore purple shirts and ties he invented a new drink the purple martini he purchased an antique locomotive painted it purple and transported it to griggsville to serve as an attraction at his museum of bird curios he lobbied unsuccessfully the illinois legislature to name the purple martin the state bird in place of the cardinal in griggsville

traditional enemy of the martin traps that allowed squatting house sparrows to be evicted and owl guards to ward off the swooping nocturnal hunters from attacking martins in messrs wade and musselman installed of the bird houses along griggsvilles main drag rechristened purple martin boulevard although designed for birds the units had to be sold to humans and it was as a marketer of avian abodes that mr wade truly excelled he patented several designs and produced models ranging from the basic unit model priced at &# to the luxurious unit four story "castle" at &# many people in griggsville affirm the little birds abilities especially after the western illinois fair which annually brings pestilential swarms in its wake "when we started getting martins we quit having flies and mosquitoes " j r skinner the fairs secretary told the st louis post dispatch in mr wade repeated the mosquitoes a day figure so often that the last four digits of his home phone number were changed to as a stunt in the s mr wade advertised in a texas newspaper for a half million mosquitoes "in good health" as food for the purple martins in an interview this week griggsville mayor kent goewey said the birds continue to help control pests from local hog farms charles r brown a university of tulsa biologist regarded as a purple martin authority discounts the mosquito claims "they dont eat mosquitoes " he says "theyre too small to bother with martin take larger prey such as dragon flies and butterflies " but mr brown credits mr wade for doing "a great deal for martins as a species" by providing housing "theyre wonderful almost semidomesticated birds i would wager that most people after they get to know them dont care that they dont eat mosquitoes " adds john tautin executive director of the purple martin conservation association "if you fly around all day with your mouth open you might ingest one" mosquito when asked about the mosquito eating claims in a interview with the wall street journal mr wade said he was speaking of the birds "capacity " based on its stomach size but a cheerful cartoon purple martin mascot sign stands in a field in griggsville to this day with the slogan " mosquitoes per day " griggsville residents also claimed the martins didnt soil their town with droppings "women hang their laundry under purple martin houses without fear " one resident told the los angeles times in yet in brazil where the birds spend the winter some cities hired extra workers to hose martin waste off park benches and to haul off bird droppings and molted feathers in dump trucks

restaurant for truckers along u s route in ohio bob evans built an empire based on sausage clad in a trademark white cowboy hat and string tie he was a kind of col sanders of the sausage world he founded the business but in later years became something of a figurehead he had no illusions about what he was selling in supermarket meat cases and at his chain of restaurants "we romance a nonromantic product " he told the wall street journal in "our customers close their eyes and they arent eating a pound of sausage any more theyre eating this romantic farm image " hogs never appeared in his advertising not that mr evans who died june in cleveland at age was dishonest about his roots he was raised on a farm and continued to raise quarter horses and blue ribbon charolais bulls on his acre farm outside of gallipolis in southern ohio soon after world war ii mr evans opened the diner in gallipolis catering mainly to truck drivers he began making his own sausage which soon turned into a profitable business of its own he used an old family recipe that included lean cuts of pork and a blend of seasonings that the company claims still to keep in a vault at first he sold the sausage in pound tubs he carried around in the back of his pickup the company grew slowly to states around ohio and all the product was delivered fresh to supermarkets in mr evans and five friends and relatives formed bob evans farms inc the companys first restaurant called "the sausage shop " opened on his farm in the chain has grown to bob evans branded outlets in states all owned by bob evans

refused to sign a standard agreement protecting trade secrets and preventing him from founding a competing company one company insider told the wall street journal at the time that bob evans wanted to get even with his cousin because he "resented the fact that he has never been chief executive of his own company " bob evans retired in but engaged in a running feud with dan evans who remained ceo through in a interview with the cleveland plain dealer bob evans complained his cousin dismantled much of the bob evans legacy including shutting down the original diner pulling the companys booth from the ohio state fair and changing the recipe for the sausage the company responded that the diner and the fair booth were unprofitable and that the original sausage recipe remained intact interviewed by the associated press in bob evans praised the companys new management "theyre doing a pretty good job " for the most part though bob evans seemed serene in his role as a spokesman for the brand a highlight of the annual stockholders meeting was a sausage fry at his farm which for many years was also home to the annual international chicken flying meet chickens were launched from farm style mailboxes as crowds numbering in the thousands cheered them on in a japanese blacktail bantam named kung flewk doubled the old record by flying into a head wind for feet inches the company
