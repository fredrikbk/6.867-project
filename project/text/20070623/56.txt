pacis augustae augustus caesars altar of peace is that it is here at all thats because for almost years it wasnt its presence signifies a triumph of ingenuity curiosity engineering diplomacy and sheer luck over the depredations of floods time and weather uncertainty ambiguity and plain ignorance attend almost every detail on it more recently attention has focused on the structure that contains the ara pacis seventy years ago mussolini decided to celebrate the bimillennium of augustuss birth the archaeologist giuseppe moretti and the architect ballio morpurgo oversaw the hasty construction of a pavilion for the temple on the via di ripetta between the overgrown sunken remains of the emperor augustus mausoleum and the tiber things change even in the eternal city dust heat humidity and exhaust fumes took their toll on the gemlike altar which needed renewed protection in richard meiers museum of the ara pacis opened the first piece of modern architecture in romes historic center since world war ii predictable derision and condescension greeted it in fact the shell travertine glass and meiers signature egg shell white exterior walls serves its function admirably come in and have a look inside the vestibule you see a model of the campus martius in b c when the altar was constructed east of where it now stands the lower level contains related temporary exhibits at the center of everything is an authentic masterpiece although the ara pacis calls into question the meaning of authenticity since reconstructive surgery and cosmetic additions supplement much of its decoration a little less than feet long and feet wide the altar stands feet high atop a new base on the outside are two decorative registers the larger lower one with acanthus scrolls and other vegetation the upper with human figures a thin meander of swastikas separates them the motif goes back at least as far as ancient troy to the romans it symbolized the vital energy of the sun symbolism pervades the altar even with respect to the human figures along its length some of their identities are debated a few are undisputed augustus the tallest although he is mostly disfigured and incomplete in his role as pontifex maximus chief priest and agrippa his son in law and right hand man the robert moses of ancient rome emit both roman gravitas and roman realism young gaius caesar the emperors nephew and adopted heir who died in a d at age is a sweet little boy tugging at agrippas toga farther down the line two year old germanicus garbed like a grown up makes you want to reach out and pinch his plump cheek augustus understood the power of architecture and the ara pacis a delicate miniature epitomizes the idea of architecture as power originally it stood near the present via del corso and looked west the mausoleum built in b c well before the emperors death in a d faced the original pantheon to the south with the campus martius in between across from the altar a sundial atop an egyptian obelisk marked the time and on augustus birthday sept the fall equinox the shadow of the pointer reached into the altars inner sanctum apollo god of the sun was augustus mythic patron the symbolic geography glorified the hard won augustan peace that followed a century of civil wars none of it neither the peace nor the commemorative monuments lasted long agrippas pantheon burned the obelisk collapsed and the ara pacis sank into mud and oblivion flash forward in cardinal giovanni ricci da montepulciano bought nine large sculpted blocks uncovered years earlier the excavation and rearrangement of the altar extended into the past two centuries parts were bought sold and lent finally under mussolini almost everything came back close to where it had started although some sections of the altar now are casts made from distant originals the temple is undergoing a yearlong cleaning one thrill of visiting it comes from watching the white suited restorers perform their maneuvers like dental hygienists they squirt they scrape they buff we can see the figures on the walls begin to glow again even without their grand original coloration for all of its glory the altar has a domestic even constricted scale its thought that the animals were slaughtered outside the altar the priests bearing the offerings from their four legged victims mounted exterior steps and then eight interior ones an inside wall depicts an unwilling trio of sheep cow and ox an indentation in the interior floor caught and drained the messy combination of blood water and wine flowing from the altar still monumentality pervades the altar and also meiers shell the casings exterior side faces the mausoleum and reproduces augustus"res gestae " his last will and testament formerly engraved on bronze plates at his tomb the original is long gone but bilingual copies were retrieved in asia minor in the th century in addition to its depiction of real figures its list of the emperors deeds and its cornucopia of vegetal and floral motifs celebrating the bounty of the augustan peace and the italian landscape the ara pacis has four panels two each on the outside of its front and rear entrances depicting myths of origins over the main entrance are masculine figures over the rear female ones two of the four are fragmentary but the other two tell all we need to know about roman glory in front aeneas sacrifices to the penates the household gods providing a family link to augustus in the rear mother earth or ceres or the pax romana sits gracefully holding two infants with beautiful female attendants on either side and opulently depicted animals and vegetation beneath her the state is the family writ large almost a century after keats asked his imaginary grecian urn "who are these coming to the sacrifice " we pose similar questions to the ara pacis the fact that we lack definitive answers in no way diminishes its excitement in many ways it enhances it mr spiegelmans latest book
