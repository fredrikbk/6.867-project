pursuits sports golf journal not your dads golf club the bridge has a modern maverick style and a whopping &# fee bridgehampton n y youd think that a golf club in the hamptons that costs &# to join would be first and foremost fancy fancy fancy valet parking for the bentley chandeliers in the loo and attendants on the practice range standing ready to mist your face with chilled evian but that is not the kind of golf club that robert rubin the brains behind the bridge had in mind mr rubin made his fortune trading commodities and currency for drexel burnham lambert and later for aig but he retired in his s to pursue varied interests like auto racing golf and working on a ph d in architectural history "this is an idiosyncratic high end golf club not a generic high end golf club " he says for instance the lockers dont have name plaques "who needs that kind of show offy touch " he asks and theres no formal dress code "we expect people to dress you know ok you cant run around naked but if your shirt isnt tucked in or your teenage son wants to wear his hat backwards or your guest shows up in cargo shorts who cares how is that bothering anybody " easily the most dramatic expression of the clubs idiosyncratic nature is the clubhouse which opened just this month and occupies the highest point of land on the eastern end of long island it has four angular glass and steel "blades" that swirl outward from a central hub and feels more like a postmodern museum perched in the hills above los angeles than it does anything traditionally associated with golf according to the architect roger ferris the blade like design picks up on both the "dynamic tempo" of a golf swing and on the impeller assembly of a turbo charged racing engine in any case the degree views of the rees jones designed golf course which has been open for several years and peconic bay beyond are spectacular "the world has enough shingle style mcmansion clubhouses " says mr rubin who effectively controls all but of the shares in the club the rest are held by his acquiescent business partner gary davis "what were creating here we think is a model for the st century golf club " the basis for that model is mr rubins interpretation of how people actually use golf clubs these days "the clubhouse at shinnecock hills perfectly reflected its time and place " mr rubin observes referring to the famed year old golf club only seven miles away and its classic stanford white structure messrs rubin and ferris consciously imitated the way the shinnecock clubhouse dominates its landscape and is grandly visible from many locations on the course but functionally mr rubin contends the old clubhouses are no longer relevant even though a lot of new clubhouses still reflexively ape them "most of the stuff in those places never gets used so we tried to keep our clubhouse very clean and simple we were after stylish informality " he says the bridge has no banquet hall only a smallish dining room bar and terrace and will not rent itself out for cocktail parties or similar functions "we dont want members coming off the th hole at or oclock in the evening and feel like theyre getting crowded out of their own clubhouse " another thing that mr rubin noticed is that modern golf club members like to sit around in their locker rooms after a round and schmooze so he decreed that the locker rooms should have the nicest views as a result the entire front walls of both the mens and womens versions are floor to ceiling glass feet tall in places and they open out directly onto the clubs wraparound stone terrace standing around in a towel is a great way to enjoy the view mr rubin acknowledges that some of the clubs features are "a little strange " the exercise room has only pilates equipment for instance he finds televisions in the locker room to be bothersome so he allows only the one at the bar and the art reflects his own peculiar interests including racing cars the acre site was originally a track which he took control of in the s and ran for years and mid th century french furniture but none of this has kept him from finding members even at &# a pop the earliest memberships went for a mere &# mostly they are self made men and a handful of women in finance hedge funds and real estate with a couple of doctors and lawyers thrown in he calls them his "scholarship guys " although they get no discount and a few in entertainment including hip hop mogul lyor cohen and artist richard prince "it can sound like a ridiculous amount of money but a lot of members justify the cost by thinking of the club as the extra room they dont have to add onto their house " mr rubin says in an area where houses routinely cost &# million and the really good ones near the ocean go for &# million or more this argument holds some logic especially since membership will cap at least for the time being at currently the count is he describes the club with its cool minimalist architecture and its astounding views as a place to appreciate the more meditative aspects of golf which too much traffic would spoil but if i were a member id have a hard time not meditating about that &# initiation fee which doesnt include tax by the way or the annual dues of around &# the tax about &# is particularly interesting to contemplate in most places it would get you the best golf club
