lifeline bear stearns bails out fund with big loan injection of &# billion caps days of drama subprime sector fears bear stearns cos s dramatic decision to lend as much as &# billion to one of its two troubled hedge funds staves off the risk of a fund collapse that could have damaged its position as a major wall street bond player and had the potential to ripple through a jittery subprime mortgage market the loan on friday came only after days of high stakes brinksmanship with some of wall streets biggest players all wanted to protect their stakes in the hedge funds but they worried as well that a liquidation of the funds which invested heavily in subprime mortgage assets risked igniting a broader panic in the mortgage bond market the events have kept wall street riveted for two weeks because a lot of firms are deeply invested in the subprime sector which caters to borrowers with weak credit and which has suffered in the housing downturn as delinquent loans have spiked bear may have prevented a wider meltdown and kept many of the subprime bonds from plunging in value in a fire sale its injection of money also will help bring order to the market and pay back loans made by other big wall street banks to the bear managed hedge fund called the high grade structured credit strategies fund though prospects for a sister fund that relied even more on debt the high grade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage fund remain in doubt the firm whose move helps preserve its reputation eventually might even make some money from the struggling investments together the two bear funds once commanded investments of more than &# billion in complex debt instruments mostly backed by subprime mortgages in addition to billions more in wagers that certain markets would fall stock and bond markets remained wobbly friday the dow jones industrial average on friday fell closing at even if bear is able to salvage one of its funds the crisis is a black eye for the brokerage house a rough around the edges firm run by year old james cayne one of wall streets most colorful characters he is known for smoking cigars in his office and being unbending often saying he doesnt want to travel to see other chief executives and politicians it may also end up being a financially costly gambit for the firm whose performance is already feeling the pinch of the subprime woes prior to yesterday bears financial exposure to the funds was largely limited to &# million invested by the firm and its executives yesterday bear described the move as a responsible one for the market "were trying to deal with this problem in as forthright a way as we possibly can " bears chief financial officer sam molinaro said in a midday conference call with analysts its share price fell more than for the week after dropping &# on friday to &# the clash provides a case study on the challenges that some big hedge funds face in navigating a world full of complicated financial instruments over the past decade or so financial markets have grown substantially and have spread globally leading to sophisticated and complex ways to place bets often with large amounts of leverage the past several years have been noteworthy because there hasnt been a major system shaking financial problem but with that has come a worry among regulators scholars central bankers and others that has led an ever increasing appetite for risk that is bound to end badly for someone so far none of the hiccups has had a system rattling effect no major institution has collapsed stock and bond markets have been buoyant but each new episode renews worries that it will be the one to have ripple effects "regulators are likely to force banks to review their lending standards more carefully" in light of the funds meltdown said richard bove of punk ziegel &amp co punk a boutique investment bank "the economics of the business have changed in a very negative fashion as bear makes its &# billion loan the american banking system is safe and sound because the regulators demand that failing loans be allowed to fail " others anticipate more limited fallout though "we continue to see this issue as more a reputation issue for bear versus one that could lead to significant loss of equity capital " banc of america securities analyst michael hecht said in a report the steady inflow of cash from yield hungry players such as hedge funds into subprime mortgages in recent years is one reason it became so easy for borrowers with spotty credit to get loans market conditions had already turned against such lending earlier this year and the threat of fire sale prices of subprime backed securities by the hedge fund or its creditors could have further tightened the taps on such credit making it even more difficult for borrowers to get loans firms that loaned money to the hedge funds to make additional investments some of wall streets other big players such as j p morgan chase &amp co merrill lynch &amp co goldman sachs group inc and barclays plc spent much of the week testing the markets appetite for the mortgaged backed assets in the fund which they held as collateral the results were mixed some assets were scooped up at or near asking prices but others received offers of cents on the dollar or less which left some of bears lenders holding hard to sell assets bears rescue attempt might not end the turmoil in the market the future of both funds remains in some doubt it isnt clear yet how other banks will respond to this latest financing offer banks are still seeking to sell off collateral from the more indebted fund meanwhile the credit line proposed by bear could enable the less leveraged fund to survive it isnt the first time bear known as one of the savviest bond players has had tense dealings with wall street firms in a crisis some industry veterans still resent the way bear and mr cayne acted during the wall street led bailout of long term capital management a large hedge fund that nearly collapsed in there were striking similarities to the current predicament in that situation too a large hedge fund was failing and it fell to wall street to consider propping it up or walking away in that case major financial institutions met at the new york federal reserve in september to determine their contributions to the ltcm bailout speaking first mr cayne jolted the gathering by announcing bear wouldnt participate according to witnesses arguing his firm already had taken on plenty of risk clearing trades for ltcm some rival executives were incensed even now bear relishes its contrarian role at private dinner wednesday night in washington to meet presidential candidate barack obama several of wall streets top executives were in attendance bear stearns co president warren spector drew some of the biggest laughs when he introduced himself as working for bear stearns "the current scourge of wall street " mr spector didnt return a call seeking comment the funds behind the current blowup are run by ralph cioffi a year bear veteran whose low key manner has made him popular with fellow investors and salespeople in the mortgage bond securities industry mr cioffi joined bear as a bond salesman and became its new york head of fixed income sales in a specialist in securities backed by other kinds of bonds and debt he helped build bears business of creating and trading these products he took on other top roles in the investment bank over the years in march he started the high grade structured credit strategies fund the two funds he managed as their names implied invested more than of their assets in securities that were supposed to be as safe as or almost as safe as a u s treasury bond according to documents reviewed by the wall street journal but these investments were much different from treasurys while treasurys are widely traded and have values that can be easily tracked the bear funds were concentrated in little traded derivative instruments known as collateralized debt obligations or cdos these investments package together pools of assets and pay investors interest based on the payments they receive from the assets the assets backing many of these cdos were subprime mortgages though subprime mortgages are highly risky wall street carves cdos into pieces so that some investors can take on more risk than others the bear hedge funds took on many less risky pieces they also borrowed heavily which helped to enhance their returns on those less risky pieces the strategy paid off for a long time so well that in august mr cioffis team created a similar fund that would rely significantly more on borrowing to fund its investments to boost returns at the time the high grade fund had returned more than in less than three years according to documents reviewed by the journal by january it had gone through months without a decline and boasted a cumulative return of many investors in the first fund shifted some of their money to the second fund last summer one of them was ted moss a year old real estate developer from cleveland tenn who invested about &# million in the high grade fund during "i often bragged about the fund because it didnt have a single down month in three years and that was just amazing to me " says mr moss when the second fund was launched mr moss withdrew his money from the first fund kept half of it and invested the other half in the enhanced leverage fund things started to go wrong for the bear funds early in the year in reports to investors the bear funds said they bought many cdos in late and january "with exposure to subprime collateral " anita raghavan greg ip and susanne craig contributed to this article
