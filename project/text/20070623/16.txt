caste away indias high tech revolution helps untouchables rise mr thotis job hunt hyderabad india venugopal thotis father grandfather and ancestors worked as field laborers in a tiny village in the state of andhra pradesh in southern india as dalits members of the "untouchable" caste at the bottom of indian society they were barred from temples used by upper caste hindus and from upper caste homes their name defined their low status a "thoti" in their village communicates news of a death by walking door to door mr thoti is in a different line of work and a much different station in life last fall he got a new job as a software developer in the hyderabad office of american infoserv inc a new jersey based technology and outsourcing company mr thotis success after a long slog has been modest by u s and even some indian standards he earns about &# a month and travels by bus around this clogged technology hotspot of about four million people but his monthly earnings are roughly double what his father made in a year and he has left the one room thatched hut with no electricity or running water that he grew up in for a basic three bedroom apartment that he shares with his wife and two young children "now we are a little comfortable " he says for thousands of years advancement in india has been restricted by its caste system which is enshrined in the countrys dominant hindu religion while brahmins the highest caste are said to stem from the mouth of purusha or universal man dalits were considered so impure they were left outside the structure altogether castes which often can be identified by a persons last name reach into every part of indian society but indias rapid economic expansion and its booming high tech sector are beginning to chip away at the historical system that reserved well paying jobs for upper castes and menial jobs for dalits with annual gross domestic product growth exceeding companies that have hired tens of thousands of workers in recent years are looking beyond their traditional sources of employees high tech firms both foreign and domestically based are at the forefront of that search as a result some dalits are rising into indias middle class technology giant infosys technologies ltd now recruits from colleges around india many of them in semi rural areas where lower caste people often live up from about urban colleges years ago says t v mohandas pai the companys director in charge of human resources "today a great number of the people whom we hire come from poorer backgrounds both economically and socially " he says "it is changing the ground rules in india " international companies are also having an impact "we dont give a damn about any of these differences in caste or religion " says ravi venkatesan chairman of microsoft corp s india unit "it has made talent the number one issue for all companies " the ranks of dalit entrepreneurs have also been growing as india morphed in the past years from a socialist modeled economy to a market driven one and a new generation of young earners began to spend freely take vacations and rack up shopping bills that has created opportunities for dalits to open hotels and restaurants as well as find jobs as plumbers electricians air conditioning repairmen and construction workers in after moving to hyderabad jayaker daniel erpula borrowed from an associate to purchase his first taxi the next year he bought another car and in a third today age he runs a fleet of about of his employees are dalits mr erpula who also owns a filling station an inn and a small water bottling plant recently held a party for guests at his new &# three bedroom home three of his employees who belong to a higher caste failed to show he says he later heard that one of them told a colleague "hes a dalit why should we go " but mr erpula says many of the higher caste neighbors in his prosperous neighborhood have welcomed him "they respect me because im financially sound " he says still success stories like those of mr erpula and mr thoti who struggled many years to get his job are rare estimates of the number of dalits with skilled jobs and steady salaries in indias new economy vary from tens of thousands to around according to employers workers experts and government officials thats out of a total dalit population estimated at about million or about of indias total population of billion many dalits especially in rural areas dont have a shot at a decent education a must for the fastest growing areas of indias economy like software development medicine and engineering those that are educated are typically taught in their native language leaving them ill prepared to compete with wealthier english schooled job applicants because a persons caste can often be determined by last name or fathers occupation hiring managers can stick to their own kind dismissing lower castes who frequently lack refined social skills or self confidence in job interviews "we find our interviewing staff is very biased toward people who look right particularly at the initial interview stage " says azim premji chairman of indian technology giant wipro ltd he adds that merit remains the number one criterion for hiring some even argue that the new economy is bolstering caste distinctions an august study of technology workers at multinationals or sizeable indian tech companies found that came "from upper castes and or economically better off communities " indias government has long employed an affirmative action program that reserves of all national government jobs to those from underprivileged classes now prime minister manmohan singh wants companies to voluntarily diversify their workplaces across the street from a small park with childrens swings mr

of dalits about miles away for performing his duties as a thoti mr thotis father earned about &# a day in addition to the pittance he earned working the fields "at the early stage of my life i strongly desired not to follow in my fathers footsteps " mr thoti says as a child mr thoti was a good student and was particularly interested in math and science graduating first in his high school class he was accepted to the equivalent of a junior college in the area mr thotis parents urged him to forget school and get a job instead mr thoti borrowed about &# to help pay the admission and application fees and for travel when he arrived mr thoti slept on a bus stop bench under a tamarind tree for two weeks odd jobs later allowed him and some friends to rent a room after two years in mr

working as a teachers assistant for a nongovernmental organization working on dalit issues financially supported by the ngo he completed his bachelors degree and entered a masters program in computing at a nearby university mr thoti who learned to read and write basic english in school but couldnt speak the language read grammar books at night and practiced speaking higher caste students called him and other dalits "gold medalist students" sarcastically referring to the fact that dalits usually lacking english language skills are less academically prepared but benefit from the schools affirmative action admission policies the taunts angered mr thoti but he said nothing one night when he wasnt feeling well mr thoti and a friend stood up to their tormentors they backed down but mr

landing jobs mr thoti applied as "t venugopal " venugopal his first name is a common brahmin name but his main problem he says was his lack of english the rejections continued "i was very upset " mr

director of the indian unit of datacard group an identity and payment card company based in minnetonka minn mr raos wife was involved in dalit issues and mr rao says hes sympathetic to the cause "i did see the desire in him to be successful " mr rao says verifone hired only from indias top colleges so mr rao found mr thoti a job writing software code for a small company that worked with verifone mr rao recalls that in interviews and in the first few months of his new job mr thoti spoke little "if he wasnt sure of the answers he wouldnt even talk about it and stay absolutely quiet " mr rao says he often said nothing in meetings with higher caste colleagues and didnt sit down when chatting with higher caste acquaintances "youd have a casual conversation with him and ask him to take a seat and he wouldnt i literally had to force him to sit down " says mr rao a year old brahmin he adds that mr thoti called him "sir" for the first months they knew each other even though mr rao told him not to like other dalits mr rao knows he says mr thoti "was always scared of making a fool of himself in table manners " in his village mr thoti ate with his hands and sitting on the floor in bangalore he had to get used to sitting at a table to eat and learn to use a spoon he exchanged the tightly folded towel he typically wore around his waist when in the village for trousers and shirts that are the uniform of high tech indian office workers in mr thoti moved to a new job in chennai on indias southeast coast at his new workplace he dodged many questions from colleagues until finally revealing he was a "scheduled caste" the term for those who benefit from affirmative action for government jobs after that he says "they were maintaining their distance not close like previously " once their caste is revealed other dalits say they too are sometimes shunned at work by higher caste colleagues "most of my friends in other industries dont reveal their caste " says raghu eshwar a dalit and senior software developer at mindtree consulting ltd a technology consulting company with headquarters in bangalore but mr eshwar says the money earned in tech gives dalits self confidence "the moment you have money people will give some value to you " he says "with the power i have i feel i dont have to hide" my identity with his &# a month salary mr thoti bought a new small concrete house with two rooms and an outside toilet for his parents but in after the technology bubble burst mr thoti lost his job he considered returning to his village to start a school but his wife jayamala convinced him to stay in high tech "what is there in the village there is no rain not much work how can we eat food " she told him the family moved to hyderabad and mr thoti took a job as a technician at a microfinance company where he worked for the next five years the company frequently didnt pay employees for two or three months "there was no rice the rent was due shopping fees paying bills very difficult " his wife says mr thoti posted his resume at online job sites including monster com last fall he got an interview as a software developer for american infoserv he was interviewed by
