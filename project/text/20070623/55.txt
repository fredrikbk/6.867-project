pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations whats not to like hillary clinton doesnt have to prove shes a man she has to prove shes a woman she doesnt have to prove to people that shes tough enough or aggressive enough to be commander in chief she doesnt have to show she could and would wage a war she has to prove she has normal human warmth a normal amount of give of good nature that she is not at bottom grimly combative and rather dark this is the woman credited with starting and naming the war room her staff has nicknamed her "the warrior " get in her way and shed squish you like a bug this has been her reputation for years and it is her big problem people want a president to be strong but not hard a longtime supporter of mrs clintons spoke with candor some months back of her friends predicament "were back where we were in likability nothing has changed " back then when the clintons were newly famous their consultants were alarmed to find the american people did not believe hillary was a mother they thought she was a person with breasts in a suit she had a briefcase and a latte and was late for the meeting but no way did she have a child so the clintons began to include their daughter chelsea then in campaign appearances which helped where is chelsea now shes trying to parallel park the sopranos video the clintons made and released this week was smart and well done it was witty and it was quite literally daring it addressed yet again the likability problem but from a new angle mrs clintons most effective means of communication is not the debate stage the sit down interview or the podium where her speeches are both tinny and hectoring her most effective area is in short campaign videos you have seen them mrs clinton seated on a couch with soft lighting she is dressed in a soft pastel sweater or jacket with a mellow strand of pearls and flowers in the background the videos are always artfully edited she can do many takes and thats why they look so good in the short soprano film mrs clinton was beautifully made up and quietly dressed in slacks and sweater like a handsome suburban lady waiting for her man at a booth in a diner he looked great too of all modern presidents bill clinton was most made for the camera and he can really act he actually looked disappointed at being served carrots and not onion rings the film jokingly acknowledges what the clintons well know that a certain portion of the voting population sees them as well as gangsterish as dark and dishonest to a degree more extreme than is usual even in political figures by putting these perceptions so colorfully on the table they make fun of them and they invite their foes to go too far at just the right moment a year before the presidential race really begins this is a good time for the clinton campaign to face the charge that theyre tony and carmella in a year such comments will be old hat "a rehash " or as one of her campaign aides said when asked for reaction on the recent hillary biographies it was the best staff line of the year "is it possible for you to quote me yawning " so the sopranos spoof wasnt bringing up that which must not be said it was saying it and getting rid of it a piquant aspect the bad guy in the video who eyeballs mrs clinton really "is" a mobster the actor who played johnny sack in "the sopranos " the clintons enemies are the real gangsters as an added benefit the spoof probably got some people actually paying attention if only for a second to the fact that mrs clinton has chosen a campaign theme song to hear it you must go to her site why would hillary pick a song distinguished only by its schmaltzy averageness because she thinks its the kind of music a likable feminine middle class woman would like because her consultants researched the exact number and nature of fans who go to celine dions show in vegas each years and determined they are the exact middle of america because it focus grouped well all of the above as for her attempts to appeal to centrists two items deserve note one is that mrs clinton has taken on the stump to referring to herself as "born in the middle of america in the middle of the century " this is interesting because its word for word what george h w bush said in when he introduced his choice of dan quayle she has also taken to referring to herself as famous but unknown which is exactly what was said of vice president bush the same year mrs clinton seems to have been studying which was the last time anyone won the presidency in a landslide but there is another side of the clinton campaign and i found some of it this week it is a new web site called hillaryis com it is rather mysterious it does not divulge who is running the site or who staffs it it is not interactive it has one informative voice and its target audience seems to be journalists and free lance oppo artists and it reads like the warriors id hillary "took on" a journalist this week and "beat him into submission " bloomberg has "stripped himself of allies" in "new yorks cutthroat politics " "expect stormy days ahead for bloomberg " who will wind up "lonely " republicans "will attempt to rip him to shreds " "a may surprise announcement will be met with mounds of research accumulated over the next months " in tone the site is very tokyo rose encouraging readers to send in "confidential tips " its primary target and obvious obsession is barack obama "senator barack obama d rezko is busy lately lying about president bill clinton" and "attacking entire communities " "we have written extensively on obama and his indicted slumlord friend antoin tony rezko we have repeatedly warned david axelrod michelle obama and barack obama that this story is not going away " the obama campaign is "still posing as innocents incapable of doing anything unsavory even as evidence mounts that unsavory is their favorite dish " "dirty obama smear" and "obamas dirty mud politics are two recent headlines this appears to be the subterranean part of hillarys campaign the part that quietly coexists with the warm chuckling lady playing the jukebox with her husband it coexists with the maya angelou part the listening tour part the filmed parts it is the war room part i suspect the site is a back door to that war room politics aint beanbag it is not generally an ennobling profession but if mrs clintons aides want to understand better her likability problem they should look at this site its dark in there
