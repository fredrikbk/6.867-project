pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink two nations one name tuesday night the caucus room of the cannon house office building was packed enough to give a fire marshal pause peru was throwing a capitol hill bash to woo politicians and their staffs as part of its campaign for a pending free trade pact whether because of interest in trade policy or just the promise of free food and drink the turnout proved to be more robust than anyone had anticipated perus ambassador felipe ortiz de zevallos stepped up to the microphone looking out at the crowd with a mix of satisfaction and concern he blurted "i hope we have enough pisco sours " a thirty something staffer standing in front of me lifted her drink in the air and let out a celebratory whoop that demonstrated that she at least had had enough pisco sours the national drink of peru has enjoyed something of a surge of late in trendy latin tinged bars in the u s even so its most important part the grape brandy called pisco can still be difficult to find in heartland liquor stores and when one does find pisco on the shelves it is just as likely to be from chile which boasts a pisco industry that dwarfs perus output chileans you see also claim the pisco sour as their national drink though they construct it rather differently from their neighbors in peru a sour is made with pisco lime juice sugar egg white and a few drops of angostura bitters in chile they use lemon juice instead of lime often omit the egg white and almost always abjure the bitters though some top the drink with a dash of whiskey for decades peruvian distillers have chafed at the very notion of chilean pisco in part the animosity goes back to the wars the countries fought in the s contests that didnt exactly go well for peru it probably doesnt help that the very name of the product is a sore spot it was at the peruvian port of pisco where a chilean army landed in and began its eventual march on lima but mostly they have griped that chiles pisco business has come at the expense of their own in a peruvian congressman named urbino julva charged that chiles version of the brandy was a usurpation of what ought to be a peruvian trademark come jaime alvarez calderon of the peruvian foreign ministry declared "only peru has the soil the climate and the tradition in making pisco that give our drink a special taste and which allow us to call it pisco " in recent years peru sought relief from the world trade organization and the world intellectual property organization chile is still making pisco tempers seem to have cooled of late when i asked a spokesman at the peruvian embassy about the chilean stuff he didnt denounce it but rather deadpanned a comic curiosity "they make pisco in chile " for their part chileans have chosen to be gracious in victory a pisco primer distributed by the chilean embassy praises perus export piscos as being "of consistently high quality " worthy of being sipped neat and "drier and more aromatic than most chilean piscos " ambassador mariano fernandez notes that because neither chile nor peru has succeeded in exporting pisco in significant quantities the long running spat over rights to the product is "an intellectual philosophical dispute" and not of particular commercial consequence he suggests that perus producers would sell more pisco abroad if they teamed up with their chilean counterparts "to promote export of our common spirit " but how to promote it there have been many failed efforts in the s chilean exporters proclaimed that pisco was "destined to displace whiskey in the united states " in the s the chileans cut a u s distribution deal with seagrams and expressed hope "that the pisco sour will take a bite out of the martini market " neither happened perhaps because for the pisco sour to prosper it needs to be aimed not at whiskey bibbers or martini devotees but rather at the large audience for margaritas the attitude of martini drinkers is represented by one of the most opinionated authors on drink david embury who was unkind to pisco in his book "the fine art of mixing drinks " expanding on his dislike of grappa and marc embury extended his unfavorable opinion to the andean cousin of those spirits "i am told that it is quite popular in peru " embury wrote of pisco "which is one reason i am satisfied to remain in the united states " not just unkind but unfair the peruvian pisco i was able to find at my local liquor store was a brand called macchu pisco and it is a surprisingly subtle spirit for a brandy that doesnt spend years in oak the chilean piscos i tried such as alto del carmen were less refined but still versatile enough to work in a variety of drinks sours are not the only way to drink pisco in chile there is a popular if somewhat declasse drink called a piscola made by mixing pisco with coke and in peru there is a highball called a chilcano i was introduced to that drink by dow jones newswires correspondent and pisco scholar drew benson who himself first learned of the chilcano when reading mario vargas llosas "conversation in the cathedral " early in the novel a newspaper reporter named norwin is found at a cafe "fondling a chilcano and having his shoes shined " the chilcano is made by mixing pisco key lime juice angostura bitters and ginger ale on the rocks in a tall glass garnished with an orange slice and a cherry norwin defends his drink as essential to his craft "theres no such thing as a teetotaling newspaperman " but the pisco sour is rightly the essential pisco drink albert giesecke an archaeologist who lived and worked in the perihelial peruvian andes for decades once told a reporter that pisco sours were "a great help in case you get mountain sickness " he was quick to add "also a great help if you dont have mountain sickness " email me at eric felten wsj com peruvian pisco sour  oz pisco  oz fresh lime juice  oz simple i e sugar syrup to taste  fresh egg white or tbsp
