politics &amp economics punishing china will it fly bills in congress on yuan could backfire as congress moves closer toward enacting legislation to punish china for its currency policy critics are taking a harder look at the effectiveness and legality of the proposed measures last week lawmakers introduced several bills to address beijings unwillingness to allow the yuan to appreciate faster proposing such potential penalties as antidumping tariffs and world trade organization action against china a bill co sponsored by senate finance chairman max baucus d mont and iowa sen charles grassley the panels top ranking republican specifically is viewed as having a good chance of passage though not until fall at the earliest already though skeptics are raising doubts that any of the bills would have their desired effects of getting beijing to revalue its currency more quickly and ultimately of significantly reducing the u s trade deficit with china which topped &# billion last year some note the challenges of deciding whether the chinese currency is in fact undervalued a precondition for potential intervention in some of the bills others are questioning the legality of categorizing currency as a trade issue that could be addressed through the wto in the end it boils down to "whether its wto consistent and whether the impact of taking action would undermine u s china relations to the detriment of u s companies " said myron brilliant a vice president at the u s chamber of commerce in washington the yuan has appreciated about since china abolished its peg to the dollar in july and began allowing it to trade within a certain band each day critics allege that chinese government interference in the market has kept the yuan at an artificially low level rendering chinese imports unfairly cheap relative to other countries goods chinese premier wen jiabao has said beijing wont make another administratively directed revaluation after doing so once already instead it will allow the yuan to move through daily shifts in the market but international patience is wearing thin with china which posted a global trade surplus of &# billion in frustration over its yuan policy and the white houses reluctance to take a tougher approach on the issue is running especially high in the democratic controlled congress critics of the latest bills argued that even if any were to succeed in getting china to boost the yuan such a move wouldnt necessarily bring about a significant reduction in the u s trade deficit with china "a revalued yuan will not force the chinese to buy american goods and services " said james zimmerman chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china he said washington should encourage china to improve market access for american goods and strengthen export assistance to u s firms chinese academics often point out that after the plaza accord engineered a appreciation of the yen against the dollar over two years the u s trade deficit with japan didnt go down substantially some wonder whether relaxed currency controls might actually cause a depreciation of the yuan "if capital flows were liberalized entirely i think you would see a lot of capital flight " said dan ikenson an associate director at the cato institute "that would drive the value of the yuan down " time is another issue erin ennis a vice president of the u s china business council a washington based lobbying group said the baucus grassley bill "is not even veto bait at the moment " she and others said that bill and other china legislation might have to be merged or significantly amended before they could secure the two thirds majority needed to override a possible presidential veto the bush administration has said it opposes what it calls protectionist legislation even if a china currency bill passed "by the time any of this stuff takes effect the chinese will have moved the yuan voluntarily " said gary hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the baucus grassley bill for example would require the government to consider imposing antidumping penalties six months after the treasury reports a currency as misaligned as a result of a countrys currency policy if the accused government doesnt redress the problem in the next six months the u s trade representatives office would take the case to the wto allowing time for dispute settlement and appeals before the wto issues a ruling it would be close to the end of before any final measures would be taken "therell be a lot of businesses out of business by weve lost over three million manufacturing jobs since " said bill hickey president of latham hickey steel corp a chicago based steel processor and distributor mr hickey favors other bills that propose harsher more immediate penalties by then the yuan may well have appreciated substantially on its own if current trends continue the currency will probably be up about in total by the end of this year if it continues to rise by a year the consensus figure that would put it up a cumulative by the end of even if the wto were to rule in favor of the u s the global trade body couldnt force china to revalue the yuan but only allow the u s to impose certain penalties on chinese goods if the u s were to act alone chinese companies could take their business elsewhere many chinese businesses have already begun to diversify from the u s market "under todays situation we must diversify the product structure and to walk with many legs " said zhan jingang general manager of textile exporter qingdao yijia efar import &amp export co in the northeastern port city of qingdao he said that only one fifth of the companys exports go to the u s now from more than a few years ago china would have other options as well it could cut off market access for u s goods or deny construction or production permits a trade war might ensue "you cant rule out a backlash " said scott miller director of global trade policy for procter &amp gamble co which counts china as its largest market outside the u s "that ought to be part of the calculus that lawmakers should consider " another major point of contention is whether anyone can accurately pinpoint how much beijing would need to let the yuan appreciate before it was fairly valued most of the anti china bills introduced so far would impose penalties until the currency was no longer deemed "misaligned " but dont specify what that level is last week the international monetary fund announced a rule change aimed at improving its monitoring of other countries currency policies it said it hopes to shame any nation publicly identified as a currency manipulator into changing its practices the imf didnt however adopt any new enforcement measures two recent imf working papers concluded that it is extremely difficult to estimate a currencys undervaluation with any real confidence currency estimates are long term calculations and dont necessarily indicate how much a currency might be undervalued at current rates said a report co author frank vargo vice president for international economic affairs at the national association of manufacturers a washington based lobbying group said the main worry for many u s companies would be chinas response to any u s action the companies "are more concerned about peace in the valley than they are about the currency revaluation they are worried that if there is legislation there is going to be a negative chinese response " he said sue feng in beijing contributed to this article
