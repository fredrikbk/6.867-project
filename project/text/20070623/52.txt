pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state saving the best for last when hosting a dinner with friends i am torn as to when to serve the "best" wine s of the evening the entree is usually the highlight of the meal and a moment at which i may want to serve a more noteworthy wine however by that time our guests and we may have consumed wines that have somewhat dulled our wine discriminating senses and what about special dessert wines neil dashiell indianapolis for wine lovers like us the issue of the best order for the wines really is an issue on the one hand we want to serve an impressive wine as soon as our guests arrive on the other we too usually reserve the star attraction for the main course of the meal and we do enjoy serving dessert wines if only to show our guests how good they can be so we usually serve an impressive but light wine when they arrive a dry light riesling is always a good bet but depending on whether were serving the wine with an appetizer a young fresh sauvignon blanc is good too dont forget about bubbly which is always hunger inducing and fun for dessert after a big meal and two or three wines we prefer to serve a light muscat wine there are many muscats out there but if you look for one with a fairly low alcohol content youll likely find a wine with a light honey like airiness thats perfect as a last taste of the night and remember you dont have to finish the bottles gauge your guests consumption you might want to pour lightly in the beginning or move more swiftly to the star of the night depending on how the wine is being enjoyed whatever you do dont fret about this so that it becomes a chore you want to enjoy your gatherings too taking the first sip my husband has never acquired a taste for wine he is willing to try but i dont want to scare him away on the first sip where do i start im sure it should be a white wine but which one susan collins geneva ill if you were willing to start with a red wed suggest beaujolais slightly chilled in terms of a white we chewed this around for quite a while our first thought was a riesling kabinett from germany because these are so lovely and friendly but were concerned that its hint of sweetness might be off putting to someone who has probably heard that sweet wines are bad and german names and labels can be scary wed fear that a good sauvignon blanc might seem too "sharp " chardonnay would be a good choice because everyone has heard of it and just about everyone likes it but most u s and australian chardonnays these days are too heavy and sweet so we finally decided on this try a chardonnay from chile or argentina the labels are as easy as the wines and theyre inexpensive so theres no pressure for our recent column about these wines drop us a note at wine wsj com also you might want to think about what you like and why wine enjoyment can be infectious one wine many tastes when wine writers speak of a wine "with tastes of vanilla pineapple mango and passion fruit " does one person find all that in one wine or is it the result of several peoples impressions we often hear a wine described by six or eight such words but feel lucky to find one or two good ones to describe a single wine paul and ursula cooney palo alto calif we have been drinking wine together for almost years and talk at length pretty much about every bottle so its natural for us to discuss the various flavors we sense to us this is part of the fun and its interesting the way various tastes show up and disappear as a wine opens and warms but wine is highly personal what one person senses is different from what another person senses it has so much to do with taste buds wine drinking experience and even personal background dottie grew up loving fruit john did not that affects what we sense and how much we like various wines one classic description of the aroma of good sauvignon blanc is "cats pee on a gooseberry bush" so much so that theres even a wine with the name but weve never had a cat or seen a gooseberry bush so we wouldnt say that when wine writers use various terms theyre simply trying to give an idea of what a particular wine tastes like so you can decide if youd like to try it dont feel any pressure to find descriptors and adjectives to describe wine unless like us you actually enjoy doing this "really good" is about as powerful a description as you need as you go down the road of wine you might find it fun to see if you can sense pencil shavings in cabernet franc for instance but theres certainly no reason to think you have to youre planning to drink it not draw with it after all
