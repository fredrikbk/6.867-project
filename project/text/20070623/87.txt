wrong time for buy write options strategy lags behind in a climbing market a popular approach to options trading may not serve investors well in a rising stock market the strategy known as "buy write" or "covered call selling " consists of purchasing a stock while simultaneously selling call options which give buyers the right to pay a certain price for the stock by a certain date the money gained by selling the options which can be thought of as a dividend will either pad losses in the underlying stock position or add to returns the relative simplicity of the approach has made it popular among newcomers to options trading and has also spawned several mutual funds in recent years fund researcher lipper inc counts open end and closed end funds that follow the approach such as blackrock enhanced equity yield and eaton vance enhanced equity income with at least &# billion in assets invested the chicago board options exchange estimates that about &# billion in assets are invested in products pegged to its standard &amp poors buywrite index but this years run up in stocks highlights the strategys key weakness that it underperforms in a rising market this happens because call sellers are giving someone else the right to buy their stock if it rises and that caps potential gains in the stock portion of the position the cboes buy write index has gained about in the past year the s&amp p itself is up nearly over the same period adherents of the approach say that those using it need to understand the trade offs it can still serve as one piece of a diversified strategy they argue and can still generate above average returns if investors direct it toward lagging stocks or sectors still if history is any guide a continued stock rally could bode poorly for the funds launched in recent years that are tied to the buy write approach the "downfall" of these funds says tom roseen senior research analyst at lipper comes when the stock market has big moves up or down "they are going to miss out on the big upside potential and on the downside they really dont protect all that well " he says while buy write funds have had periods of popularity in the s and s they tend to fall out of favor after stocks stage large gains says jay kloepfer director of capital markets and alternatives research for consultants callan associates inc "if we have two more years of an equity bull market well see the interest disappear " mr kloepfer says for investors deploying the buy write on individual stocks the underperformance is particularly acute when a stock is bought out at a sharp premium by private equity investors or another company "you have risk of underperforming in the event of a takeover and with stocks up at these elevated levels you have the risk of them dropping " says bud haslett director of option analytics at brokerage firm miller tabak &amp co "selling the option will compensate you for some of that risk but not all of it " proponents of the strategy acknowledge this risk "these arent strategies for the aggressive investor " says ronald egalka president of rampart investment management which advises fund managers on how to deploy the buy write rather investors should use the technique as a way to reduce risk and volatility in part of their portfolio he says and willingly accept the trade offs that come with that "you cut off some of the peaks of your performance diagram but you also cut off some of the troughs " mr egalka says what about the fact that covered call sellers miss out on profits to be made in buyouts "weve lived through these types of environments before and thats a risk that you deal with " he says
