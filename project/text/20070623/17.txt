center of a storm how cdos work mortgages are among the most widespread and simplest forms of financing so how is it that a bunch of home loans caused the crisis that has gripped wall street for more than a week because mortgages have morphed into something quite different on wall street and some say more dangerous a trend that has accelerated sharply in recent years the two bear stearns cos hedge funds at the heart of the crisis invested heavily in complex financial instruments known as collateralized debt obligations or cdos as a bet on the mortgage market the wall street firms wager under bear executive ralph cioffi went badly wrong after particularly risky home loan borrowers defaulted in record numbers as a result of lax lending standards and a slowing housing market but the funds problems quickly became more than an issue for just mortgage markets fears grew that other investors could suffer losses causing a ripple that would crimp lending and curtail the flow of borrowed money that has fueled rallies in a variety of financial markets on friday bear unveiled a &# billion bailout of the funds so what exactly are cdos the structures at the root of so much angst they are financial vehicles that bundle different kinds of debt ranging from corporate bonds to securities underpinned by mortgages to debt backed by money owed on credit cards and cut it into slices these slices are sold to investors in the form of bonds while the slices contain the same debt they differ in terms of which pay the most interest and which are least at risk of losing money slices that pay lesser amounts of interest are the last to get wiped out by losses if there are defaults in the debt pooled in the cdo slices that pay more feel pain more quickly in other words the cdo slice with the lowest yield is at the front of the line on payday but at the back of the line when pink slips are handed out this is the way that some high risk debts can be packaged to receive investment grade credit ratings thats a result of the cdo structure and the diversification gained by bundling different debts at the same time cdos use borrowed money to amplify returns although cdos have been around for about years their use soared in recent years investment banks in issued about &# billion in cdos compared with about &# billion in according to research by morgan stanley the popularity of cdos grew as low interest rates caused investors to embrace products that offered the promise of higher yields fans argue that cdos allow investors to buy into higher yielding securities while taking on the same risk as they would with safe lower yielding securities they also say that cdos are another tool that allow financial markets to further spread risk so it isnt concentrated in the hands of a few players but some investors think cdos are an example of financial engineering gone haywire cdos are "more sleight of hand" than a sound way to generate diversified returns said brad alford founder of alpha capital management an atlanta based investment advisory firm that caters to wealthy families "theyre a method for wall street to repackage securities as a way to make more money " indeed wall street has made millions of dollars in fees in recent years by creating cdos selling them servicing them and helping investors trade them the vehicles are generally used by institutional investors such as pension funds or hedge funds not individual investors cdos have generated debate because they are complex and pose a risk because they are several steps removed from the actual asset or debt that is being packaged consider a mortgage jane sixpack borrows &# from a bank to buy a house the bank then pools janes loan with thousands of other mortgages it then issues securities backed by this pool and sells those to investors jane keeps making her payments to the bank but her mortgage is now owned by investors an investment bank creates a cdo which is really just a company the cdo then buys some mortgage backed securities one of which holds janes loan the cdo then pools these with other mortgage backed securities and maybe some corporate bonds slicing them up based on investor preferences for yield versus risk the cdo manager sells portions of the package to other investors in some cases other cdos are the buyers there are even cdos comprised of cdos that have invested in cdos the bundling of different debts along with the fact that the cdos are a few steps removed from the debts they include give rise to another risk its tough to get an accurate price for cdos which dont trade in active markets when markets sour the lack of available prices can make it even more difficult to value a holding or to get out of it without taking a big haircut so investors often have to estimate the value of a cdo and have a lot of leeway in how they do it thats a worry for investors in hedge funds big buyers of cdos hedge fund managers make most of their money through performance fees this gives them added incentive to use price estimates that work in their favor even if they might not reflect the price at which they could actually trade the cdo or it could mean that the managers themselves dont know exactly what their holdings are worth because they are so far removed from the underlying investment in the case of janes loan that means the cdo buyer will have a tough time gauging whether shes a good risk or not and if she defaults it may take a while before that affects the value of the cdo even though market conditions overall might have already changed
