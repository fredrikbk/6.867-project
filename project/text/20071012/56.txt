moving the market grasso with a little help from his friends ex chief of the nyse battles to clear his name but some chums seek a settlement new york earlier this year former new york stock exchange chairman dick grasso borrowed a friends midtown manhattan office and for a moment it seemed like his heyday when he influenced the worlds stock trading and helped wall street recover from he fielded some phone calls and made plans for a charity dinner for decorated u s soldiers his friend former ubs painewebber chairman joseph grano jr ducked in mr grasso made sure mr grano could attend the dinner then hugged him good bye while he still has powerful friends this is as influential as mr grasso gets these days four years after accusations about a &# million pay package forced him from his dream job at the nyse since then mr grasso has fought a legal battle to clear his name amid accusations that his pay was inflated and improperly obtained increasingly he has relied on a tight knit group of friends who maintain that he was wrongfully accused he continues to try to prevail against new york attorney general andrew cuomo whose pending case could require mr grasso to return much of his pay to the exchange while the friends remain loyal to the onetime power broker they are divided on what he should do some feel mr grasso should put the pay flap behind him and have even tried to broker a deal with the attorney general john grunow and andrew sabin who have homes near mr grassos in sagaponack n y say they proposed a settlement with mr cuomos office that would involve mr grasso and the nyse giving millions of dollars to help world trade center emergency workers deal with ailments so far the idea has stalled as the two businessmen try to set up a meeting with mr cuomos office at the other end of the spectrum is home depot inc co founder ken langone who was chairman of the nyse committee that awarded mr grasso much of the money now in dispute mr langone has argued that mr grasso shouldnt settle because it would be tantamount to admitting he wasnt worth the money he and mr grasso both have said they did nothing wrong in coming weeks an appellate court ruling is expected to decide whether to uphold or overturn a trial court judges october ruling that mr grasso broke his fiduciary duty by failing to disclose his pay more fully the ruling could cost the year old mr grasso &# million or more if it stands up some of mr grassos friends say it is time to move on a recent legal victory for mr grasso in which a new york appellate court ruled that the attorney general doesnt have the authority to bring key parts of the case gives mr grasso momentum they say mr cuomo succeeded now gov eliot spitzer who brought the case originally and some of mr grassos friends are hoping mr cuomo will prove more likely to settle it mr grasso can now occasionally be found at mr granos office or mapping legal strategy with his lawyers at williams &amp connolly hardly a full time job he also lifts weights three times a week for minutes a stretch cooks for family and friends and visits upscale manhattan restaurants like il mulino and san pietro to connect with old trading floor contacts he splits his time between homes on long island and florida and is involved in a handful of nonprofit boards and charitable activities such as the nassau county crime stoppers an aspiring policeman before he started at the nyse as a clerk in mr grasso has also worked on homeland security issues with friends like mr grano once chairman of president bushs homeland security advisory council and former new york police commissioner bernard kerik for mr grasso the decision not to settle is personal he describes the day he was forced out of the exchange as the day he got "shot " according to people who have spoken with him after his pay package became a topic of national debate mr grasso heard that a professor teaching his daughter at bucknell university used mr grasso as an example of corporate greed "given the damaging and false charges that were leveled against me by the former attorney general i am committed to vindicating my name " mr grasso said in a statement sent by his lawyer "anyone with a family would understand that i can do no less " those who have known mr grasso for years support his campaign "no friends are encouraging him to settle " says tom farley a former federal bureau of investigation agent who grew up in queens n y with his friend "richie " "we encourage him to do whats right " mr grano who says mr grasso got his pay fairly called mr spitzer years ago about a settlement mr grano also offered mr grasso a full time job to be a partner at his firm centurion holdings but mr grasso turned it down because he didnt want to tarnish the firm with any associations with his case now mr grano and some others hope for a settlement that would route part of the disputed pay to one of mr grassos philanthropic causes which include cancer research world trade center site workers firefighters and police officers others counter that a settlement may not happen until the appellate court makes its ruling on the october judgment
