weekend journal review film movie miracle lars is a smart tender comedy ryan gosling shines in the oddball love tale blanchett reigns again when a movie turns out well the achievement may border on the miraculous such are the forces arrayed against filmmakers who want to work as unfettered artists but "lars and the real girl" crosses the border its nothing less than a miracle that the director craig gillespie and the writer nancy oliver have been able to make such an endearing intelligent and tender comedy from a premise that in other hands might sustain a five minute sketch on tv the premise is straightforward a likable but withdrawn young man named lars lindstrom played brilliantly by ryan gosling buys a life size sex doll on the internet and falls in love with it or rather with her since he endows his silicone beauty with a vivid personality her name is bianca shes a missionary from a brazilian danish family and she doesnt believe in pre marital sex so their relationship will be chaste at the outset were glad to go along with the gag and were not the only ones larss sister in law then his brother then the people of his midwestern town somewhere up north maybe in minnesota go along with it too albeit cautiously at first thats the wonder of this story which moves from the cheerfully ludicrous to the quietly momentous people go along with it and are changed by it as they realize that lars is not a hopeless nut job but a good soul in distress delightful as the business about bianca may be its only a catalyst for the communitys effort to help heal one of its own of all the unfashionable things in our crass day and age "lars and the real girl" is a movie about kindness it is also on its own modest terms an almost perfect movie with flawless performances ryan gosling has done extraordinary work before most notably in "the believer" and "half nelson" but the comic sensibility he unleashes here still comes as a surprise the leash is short and taut you cant even call what he does deadpan for that would suggest some hint of self comment his lars is simply rooted in every moment though that doesnt quite get at the actors art either theres nothing simple about larss fantasy life with bianca or his response to being touched by a therapist physically and emotionally in one of the best therapy sequences youve ever seen just as that life with bianca grows out of need as the therapist explains to his family with hardly a syllable of psychobabble mr goslings portrayal grows out of judgment free revelation he lets us in on the safe sweet pleasure lars takes from his ostensibly inanimate inamorata every other performance in the film is of a piece not a false note to be seen or heard paul schneider as larss older brother gus fulfills the promise he first showed in david gordon greens "all the real girls " will his next movie have a "real girl" title too while gus has managed barely to escape his familys dire destiny his emotional range remains constrained within that range though mr schneider rings witty changes on his characters obtuseness his skepticism gus is our surrogate in all of this goofiness his verbal contortions buried guilt and essential decency guss wife karin played with exquisite ardor by emily mortimer is much easier to decode pregnant and immensely pleased about it shes an earth mother to be karins first impulse is to open herself to the lives of others so she leads the charge after some brief hesitation to embrace bianca as a palpable creature of larss inner life kelli garners margo is a smaller role the ingenue who must compete with bianca for larss affection but ms garner fills it with an unaffected sweetness that recalls the early films of shelley duvall then theres the divine patricia clarkson droll dry and precise yet mysteriously intense as dagmar the towns physician who is also a psychologist an actors actor ms clarkson possesses among so many other gifts a peerless talent for listening which is perfect for dagmars sessions with lars one of the movies most delicious lines is also the most understated it comes after dagmar first meets bianca and listens to lars extolling her virtues "he appears " the psychologist says "to have a delusion " remarkably nancy olivers original script for "lars and the real girl" is her feature debut some writers spend whole careers learning to write as concisely and evocatively and hilariously as shes done the first time out though other films have turned on romance between a guy and a literal doll this one turns the notion into a classic comic parable with stirring scenes karin replying with furious hurt to larss accusation that people dont care about him gus answering larss question about how and when someone becomes a man a pastors heartfelt eulogy for a much loved member of the congregation ive held off on discussing the director craig gillespie only because the results of his work in this film are so impressive that they deserve to be appreciated fully in the context of his cast and crew but thats easier said than done when i was starting out as a young critic i would read other critics asserting with great authority that the direction in this film or that was good or bad and id wonder with great anxiety "how do they know since direction is intangible how can you tell what a director does let alone pass judgment on it " the answer of course is you can never tell exactly but the director always leaves his mark for better or worse in the movies tone and in an accumulation of details and choices in this film its for better at every turn the tone is consistently delicate one of the first details i noticed about the films physical production was the paint on the front of the garage where lars sleeps not insistently disreputable to make a point about his sad status in the world just peeling normally plausibly a nice choice if a small one grounded in reality but was it made by the director or by the production designer arv greywal no way to know still it was consonant with other nice choices small and large larss grounded laconic comment on biancas silence "shes shy everythings so new" adam kimmels clear sighted cinematography constantly showing without being showy tatiana s riegels deft editing which cuts quickly from rather than lingers on the whimsical spectacle of a child sitting on biancas lap in the doctors waiting room karins throwaway explanation of why dr dagmar is also a psychologist "she says you have to be this far north " a common denominator of these choices is trust in the material and in the audiences intelligence some may have been made by craig gillespie others by his collaborators including ms oliver but all of them were made within a stylistic climate that the director established and sustained the climate is funny breezy and warm elizabeth the golden age elizabeth the golden age" ends with cate blanchett as the virgin queen cradling a newborn babe in her arms dont worry it isnt hers digital effects can do wonders these days but the squalling baby looks real and his squalls truly seem to give way to a smile of beatific pleasure as he gets his first look at ms blanchetts face i know how the kid feels she can do no wrong and does none here though the movie around her a popcorn worthy sequel to the "elizabeth " often lapses into opacity or grandiosity in the first film the queen established the church of england and the question was whether geoffrey rushs walsingham her master of spies would get in bed with spain or france in this film directed as before by shekhar kapur the issue is war the spanish armada sets sail at ten minutes after the first hour and an impressive naval battle ensues before that though the queen spends lots of quality time with clive owens dashing silver tongued sir walter raleigh and the film qualifies as a bodice ripper or at least bodice loosener when raleigh finds blood quickening qualities in the person of the queens favorite lady in waiting bess throckmorton nice work by abbie cornish all of this is much more fun than englands history churning away in the background and alexandra byrnes costumes are to live for when you see cate blanchett in one fantastical gown after another you understand why elizabeths reign was golden
