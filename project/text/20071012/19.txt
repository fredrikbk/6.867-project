business magazines issues ad slump web new rival for many decades publishers of business magazines such as businessweek fortune and forbes thrived by following a simple formula target upscale executives and sell ad space to auto makers financial services firms and technology companies but in recent years that formula has come undone the dot com meltdown in sent technology advertising into a steep decline the slump in the auto industry has led to a cutback in car advertising and then theres the web which has weakened the magazines hold on their readers and advertisers complicating matters further the three incumbents face a new threat from a deep pocketed competitor conde nasts portfolio a glossy general interest business magazine that debuted in april mcgraw hill publications businessweek and time warner inc s fortune are responding to these crosswinds with redesigns businessweeks new version hits newsstands today and fortunes will debut in december with detroit in a slump and the subprime mortgage crisis taking a toll on the financial sector the situation may get worse total financial advertising pages fell in the first half of this year while technology dropped and autos fell according to the publishers information bureau hardest hit were businessweek and fortune each of which saw ad pages drop in the second quarter while forbes llcs forbes was down forbess competitors say its tally includes supplements and other pages that the rivals dont count adjusting for these factors they say the performance of the three is roughly equal forbes denies this and says the data prove that it is well ahead of the competition in terms of ad pages even without the special sections "they ought to spend more time making ad calls than slinging mud " says james s berrien president of the forbes magazine group businessweek forbes and fortune dont publish financial results but executives at all three acknowledge that their print ad revenue is falling as the magazines are mostly sold by subscription rather than on the newsstand their circulation doesnt tend to fluctuate as much and has remained stable while most advertising categories may recover the loss of ad revenue to the web is only likely to get worse the internet has undermined the business models of nearly all print media magazines which have a longer shelf life and offer fancier graphics than newspapers had been seen as less exposed to the web while that is certainly true for fashion magazines it isnt the case for newsier categories like business "business magazines are highly vulnerable because the web is so front and center for their readership " says peter kreisky an independent magazine consultant who has done consulting work for time inc and conde nast though it has been pilloried by critics for its journalism and design portfolio in stark contrast to its older rivals has delivered three issues thick with ads the magazine says its next two issues will be just as robust helping portfolio has been conde nasts strong relationships with luxury advertisers an area from which older business magazines have been largely absent in addition to portfolio conde nast owns titles such as vogue glamour and vanity fair an estimated of portfolios ad pages have come from the luxury and travel sectors its competitors say they are unimpressed noting that portfolios rate base the circulation it guarantees advertisers is less than half of the to copies each of the top three titles boasts they also suggest conde nast is offering advertisers space in portfolio on discount terms the incumbent titles wouldnt accept portfolio president david carey says the magazine isnt offering any "freebies" but some advertisers say privately that they are getting other incentives "its not a business magazine its a magazine about rich people " says andrew evan serwer fortunes managing editor "were the gold standard " still both fortune and businessweek are responding businessweek is narrowing its focus by emphasizing core business coverage and retreating from lifestyle areas the shift is reflected in the redesigned magazine which sports a cleaner look gone is the magazines "executive life" section which included lifestyle pieces on subjects such as new zealand spas and powder skiing in new mexico in a world of nonstop information and ever busier schedules businessweeks readers want a concise take on the weeks business news says businessweek president keith fox "readers want an intelligent filter " he says fortune is seen by some industry analysts as particularly vulnerable to portfolio forbes is best known for its conservative political bent and its focus on the wealthy while businessweek is regarded as a magazine targeted at managers on every rung of the corporate ladder fortune however seeks to attract a younger savvier audience than its competitors its heavy paper stock and focus on photography gives it the look and feel of a fashion magazine portfolio with its mix of commentary long form narrative articles and sleek photography is going after the same reader "it comes down to quality across all of our platforms we have the best brand and the highest quality audiences in the category " says vivek shah president of fortune money group time inc s stable of business magazines "i dont think you can match it " time inc has tried to bolster fortunes prospects by installing new management at the magazine and in the ad sales department which has also been restructured fortune plans a redesign of the magazine in december although some changes such as a white border around its cover have already been incorporated in addition it plans to redesign fortune com the magazine has also tried to broaden its appeal publishing its first "luxury issue" in august with designer ralph lauren on the cover and featuring stories about brooks brothers and designer marc jacobs the move was seen by some in advertising circles as an attempt to draw more fashion advertising but the issue was almost free of luxury ads "theyve been trying for a long time to diversify " portfolios mr carey says of his competitors "i can understand their frustration " fortune executives say the package wasnt an attempt to woo high end advertising or a response to portfolio for its part forbes says its strategy is to stick with its tried and true formula the magazine has benefited from a stable ad sales operation that is known as one of the most tenacious in the industry "weve been reading the same hymn for years " says the forbes magazine groups mr berrien all three established magazines have invested in their online operations in the hopes of recouping the revenue they have lost in print fortune which has bundled its web offering with corporate sibling cnnmoney has been profitable on the web last year cnnmoneys profit totaled about &# million according to a person familiar with the situation and is expected to rise by about this year forbes whose site draws a similarly sized audience is believed to earn roughly the same as cnnmoney by contrast portfolios web site has so far drawn too little traffic to show up in the rankings people close to conde nast say the publishers clear priority for portfolio is to make inroads on the print side and not online the challenges facing the business magazine category have raised questions about whether all four publications can survive "i dont think theres room for all of these titles " says mr kreisky the consultant
