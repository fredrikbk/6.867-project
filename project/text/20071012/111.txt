weekend journal sports baseball promotes from within teams with homegrown stars outperform rivals staffed by hired guns for much of the past decade the key to building a winning baseball team was to open the bank vault and sign a bunch of established stars teams pursuing this strategy included the new york yankees the chicago cubs and the boston red sox who won the world series with a team composed almost entirely of hired guns like keith foulke and manny ramirez but amid all the hand wringing about the corrosive effects of "checkbook baseball " a quiet revolution was under way this year the majority of the teams thriving in the postseason are doing it largely with the help of homegrown players nowhere is the phenomenon more pronounced than in colorado where by one measure the rockies owe a whopping of their wins to contributions from players the team drafted signed as amateurs or brought up through the minor league farm system only one league championship series team has topped that figure in years colorados overhaul began after when the disastrous signings of free agent pitchers mike hampton and denny neagle put the team in a &# million bind rather than trying to spend their way out of it and even though general manager dan odowd says he knew it would produce "some very difficult and painful seasons " the rockies refocused their attention on player development they tripled the budget for finding and signing latin american players beefed up their scouting department and developed a system of rating prospects based on their character as well as their baseball skills while the rockies failed to finish higher than fourth in their division for six seasons the team quietly began drafting and developing players like brad hawpe troy tulowitzki and outfielder matt holliday who led the team with home runs the rockies topped the national league in batting average this year and swept the philadelphia phillies to advance to the nl championship series executives say promoting your own players makes sense not only because they are familiar but because everyone in the organization knows how theyve been trained instructors in the phillies farm system for instance follow a manual that describes the "phillies way" of doing everything from warming up a pitchers arm to defending a bunt promoting from within is "a safer way to go " says the teams assistant general manager mike arbuckle when a homegrown player does well theres another benefit everyone from the scout who discovered him in high school to the trainer who nursed him through a hamstring injury feels a sense of accomplishment "this is an organizational achievement " says mark shapiro executive vice president and general manager of the cleveland indians who developed many of their top players internally this postseason teams that rely the most on homegrown stars have an excellent record according to win shares a statistic that uses an amalgam of a players hitting pitching and defensive statistics to determine his overall contribution to team victories the rockies indians and arizona diamondbacks ranked near the top among the eight postseason teams based on the contributions from players they developed internally while they moved on the cubs and yankees who ranked near the bottom of the list lost in the first round of all postseason teams the red sox had the smallest contribution from homegrown players but even they have improved thanks to emerging stars like dustin pedroia and kevin youkilis who ranked third and fourth on the team in hits homegrown players contributed wins this season more than four times the total from the team overall players who were developed internally by the four remaining league championship series teams contributed wins this season a increase from last years final four and more than the recent average for lcs teams all this reflects a sea change in baseball economics that began with major league baseballs labor deal the agreement imposed a luxury tax of up to on the big spending teams and required all franchises to share of their revenue it forced the spendthrift yankees to pay more than &# million in penalties in alone and placed more of a premium on young cheap players under baseball rules players in their first three years of major league service are entitled to a salary of &# after six years of service a player can declare free agency and test the market where salaries can soar as high as &# million and where rich teams have a decided advantage since free agency began in baseball in the s teams have made a habit of turning to the open market for talent especially when a championship seems possible before the florida marlins won the world series then owner wayne huizenga loaded the team with hired guns like bobby bonilla and moises alou but in many cases teams were burned by free agent moves that never panned out since signing a &# million deal with the yankees in slugger jason giambi has been a disappointment on the field and thanks to his involvement in a federal steroids investigation a major clubhouse distraction in colorado mr hamptons career was derailed by chronic ineffectiveness while mr neagle was arrested on charges of soliciting a prostitute and later released from the team after the labor agreement teams began stepping up investments in scouting and player development in the st louis cardinals hired jeff luhnow a former management consultant to overhaul the teams operations in this area since then the cardinals have added minor league teams in the dominican republic and venezuela allocated more money for amateur signing bonuses and tapped statisticians to help better identify which young players have big league ability for the indians the youth movement was a wrenching transition after winning a series of division titles and making it to the world series cleveland unloaded its best players and began trying to cultivate a fresh crop as the team sank in the standings attendance plummeted from million in to million in when the team lost games but as new talent began to emerge the team worked to hold onto it after just his first full season in the major leagues the indians signed catcher victor martinez to a five year contract this year homegrown players accounted for roughly of clevelands regular season wins and the fans have returned even before the diamondbacks won the world series critics believed it would take years for the team to overcome its reckless pursuit of free agents but by limiting spending and focusing on development the team returned to contention this season draftees like conor jackson justin upton and stephen drew scored more than half the teams runs this concept isnt new some teams that have long relied on homegrown players have been consistently competitive the minnesota twins made it to the american league championship series with a team nearly entirely composed of players who started in their farm system many low revenue teams like the pittsburgh pirates have had to develop most of their own players by default because they arent willing to spend money on top free agents losing has given teams like the rockies an advantage too the lower they finish in the standings the higher the picks they get in the annual amateur draft but if the indians get past boston and advance to the world series the achievement will have added meaning for c c sabathia the burly left handed all star pitcher whos scheduled to start tonights game mr sabathia was drafted by the indians out of high school and played for four of its minor league affiliates before making his debut in its a career path thats familiar to most of his teammates "a lot of us have been together a long time " says mr sabathia "it just feels good when you can look at guys like victor martinez and grady sizemore guys ive been playing with pretty much my whole career and be able to share this experience with them its a lot more satisfying "
