the daily fix the rockies keep rolling with a win over arizona online edition the colorado rockies lost to the florida marlins on sept by a score of they responded by winning in a row then on sept they lost to the arizona diamondbacks since then seven more wins without a loss three to finish the regular season including the "play in" game that gave them the national league wild card three to send the philadelphia phillies home and last nights win over the diamondbacks to open the national league championship series this one was easily summarized arizona ace brandon webb struggled with his sinker and was tagged for three runs in the third while colorados jeff francis and the colorado bullpen kept the d backs at bay "they win on their own little rocky mountain top " marvels jayson stark on espn com "they win alongside the cactus plants in the desert they win against left handers they win against right handers they win out west they win back east they won on the autumn solstice they undoubtedly would have won on columbus day if they had just been allowed to play and thursday night in the desert it was brandon webbs turn to get squashed by the colorado rockies runaway steamroller " in colorado the story is the dog that didnt bark rockies manager clint hurdle risked the wrath of the baseball gods by changing up his lineup subbing willy taveras for ryan spilborghs and shuffling kaz matsui and troy tulowitzki "this is the sort of counterintuitive move hurdle has been making throughout the rockies remarkable run " dave krieger writes in the rocky mountain news "early in the season when the club was struggling hurdle was frequently criticized for decisions that seemed too formulaic too by the book often calling on struggling relief pitchers in crucial situations simply because they were the designated reliever for that inning as the season went along the rocks manager seemed to grow more comfortable not only with his personnel but with his own ability to make moves without regard to the percentages or the book " the game was marred by an incident in the seventh inning down arizona had runners on first and second with nobody out when augie ojeda hit a grounder to colorado third baseman garrett atkins at second base arizonas justin upton reached up to take out mr matsui mr upton was rightly called out for interference resulting in a double play a doubly dumb play as it looked unlikely that mr matsui would be able to get much on his throw to first hey as met fans the fixers have seen this one before arizona fans responded by throwing objects on the field and the game was stopped for eight minutes since every gathering of more than people includes a few knuckleheads the fixers are more offended by the fact that the d backs faithful cant fill their own stadium in the postseason in the denver post mark kiszla does his part for denver phoenix cultural exchanges "as a baseball town this place is a joke the diamondbacks with four playoff appearances in the past decade deserve better than fans who still arent sure when to cheer unless they want to kill the umps maybe they dont much like baseball in arizona but they sure know how to throw garbage in the desert you stay classy phoenix " off to the junior circuit yes we had it backwards earlier for some unfathomable reason where the boston red sox and cleveland indians will commence hostilities tonight in game of the alcs in the boston globe bob ryan writes that the red sox will be a formidable foe "ask any manager on the day when pitchers and catchers report in february what would be his fondest wish for the season and he would undoubtedly say that he hopes to enter the playoffs with his team playing its best baseball that is precisely the situation terry francona finds himself in as he awaits the start of the american league championship series friday night against the indians " the problem with perfection theres nowhere to go but down "you dont need a phd in diamondology to know that if this type of offensive destruction is allowed to continue the red sox will be holding a parade in three weeks time but you all surely know that no one performs at this exalted level for very long there has to be a market correction coming however modest " in the new york sun tim marchman says the red sox can afford a modest correction "if you were given unlimited resources and told to design a baseball team from scratch it would probably look pretty much like the red sox they have youth and experience power and speed and theyre as suited to win behind a complete game shutout as behind a barrage of line drives and walks their best players dont just have clutch reputations but long histories of coming through with their best performances in the biggest spots " not that mr marchman scorns the indians the tribe finished with wins tied with boston for best in the bigs and mr marchman thinks the top of the teams rotations are a push "justly celebrated as bostons josh beckett and curt schilling are beckett was the majors only game winner this year and schilling is in a class with koufax gibson and rivera among the best october pitchers of the last years clevelands c c sabathia and fausto carmona would make a worthy top two finishers for the cy young award " in slate chris park thinks he sees the indians achilles heel "no one would be shocked if indians closer joe borowski he of the era costs the team the world series why does one of the best teams in baseball pin its ninth inning hopes on its third or fourth best reliever " if this series had taken place in it would have been thick with musings on tragedy the curse of the bambino vs the curse of rocky colavito now only the latter remains the indians won their last title in in the cleveland plain dealer terry pluto offers a crash course in cleveland misfortunes beginning with the rather entertaining shortcomings of a goofy squad before moving to mr colavito and a more historical perspective "boston was in the world series in in and in " mr pluto writes "in and they were in the playoffs during that same approximate time span when the red sox were in the postseason five times the indians never played a significant game in september they never did anything but run through different managers in years " furthermore he writes "at least the red sox never traded ted williams the indians once had a hitter like williams only he swung from the right side you will see him tonight in a boston uniform wearing no and a pair of baggy pants with room for a family of four in the seat " indians fans have been well represented among those putting up their hands to write odes to their favorite teams and soldiers from red sox nation have reported for duty but where are the rockies and diamondbacks backers cmon colorado and arizona faithful step up and thanks in the miami herald israel gutierrez checks in with stan van gundy "after more than a decade with the miami heat van gundy is beginning his first season as coach of the orlando magic " he writes "the new gig comes four years after he began his first nba head coaching experience with the heat and less than two years after he stepped down from that post under a shroud of suspicion that he was actually forced to do so but all that is past him now you can see as much in his face these days and if the past months have done anything for van gundy they have helped him recognize that hes in the right place again " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
