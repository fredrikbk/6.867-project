democrats propose measure to help subprime borrowers washington senior democrats in congress said they will move to allow fannie mae and freddie mac to temporarily increase their portfolios to help borrowers with subprime loans refinance into more affordable products sen charles schumer of new york and rep barney frank of massachusetts said they will introduce bills in their respective chambers perhaps as soon as next week that would allow the housing financiers to expand their loan portfolios by for six months such a move could force a confrontation with the bush administration which has resisted efforts to allow the government sponsored enterprises or gses to grow despite problems in credit markets "decisions impacting safety and soundness should be left to the independent regulator unbound from the political process " treasury department spokeswoman jennifer zuccarelli said "any other approach to these safety and soundness issues only highlights the need for a stronger gse regulator we look forward to working with the senate as we did with the house to achieve this necessary objective " the proposal is a targeted and scaled back version of a bill that sen schumer introduced last month rep frank initially said he wouldnt support a temporary "piecemeal" bill in this area but after discussions with sen schumer he shifted his position last week the revised bill would require that the mortgage financiers devote the vast majority of new investments to helping borrowers with subprime loans refinance
