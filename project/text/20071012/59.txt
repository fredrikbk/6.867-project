mccains medicine riding low in the polls it seems has allowed john mccain to take some policy risks at tuesdays republican primary debate he talked about the need to junk the tax code to make it fairer and flatter then mr mccain followed up with a health care reform announced in iowa yesterday perhaps recapturing the aura of political creativity that animated his presidential bid in the senators views are panoramic and hes looking at a health care landscape grounded in free market principles his major proposal would change the tax treatment of insurance to rehearse todays tax code allows businesses to deduct the costs of providing health insurance to their employees but it doesnt allow the same for individuals that creates third party payer problems for the insured and makes coverage less affordable for everyone else mr mccain would offer a refundable tax credit of &# for individuals and &# for families wed prefer a standard deduction which is cleaner as tax policy and causes fewer distortions but some argue that a credit will more quickly aid lower income families in any case the finer grains are at this point less important than the larger reform mr mccain is climbing onboard with republican opponents rudy giuliani and mitt romney who have also identified tax bias as the overriding concern one major difference among these front runners concerns insurance regulation and here mr mccain comes out on top part of the reason coverage costs differ so sharply among states is because some have chosen to impose multiple rules and mandates mr mccain would allow people to purchase policies across state lines which is currently prohibited that would let people choose the coverage levels that best serve their needs and would make insurance far more affordable for people in mandate heavy states like new york and massachusetts mr giuliani says hell allow for this eventually with some caveats and mr romney goes out of his way to trash it mr mccain takes a false regulatory lunge when he says he wants prescription drug re importation which could harm u s pharmaceutical innovation however hes on firmer ground when he emphasizes medical malpractice reform coordinated preventive care and price transparency all of which will help control health care costs these are also the natural complements of tilting the health care system toward a more market based model the senator emphasizes that reform will require "fundamental change nothing short of a complete reform of the culture of our health system and the way we pay for it " he seems to mean it too hes also proposing a major change to medicare thus becoming the only candidate republican or democrat to confront americas runaway entitlement spending medicare spending grew by last year mr mccain would do away with medicares creaking fee for service model and the government would pay providers based on outcomes while many of the details need to be worked out partially this would act to focus doctors and hospitals on coordinated care for seniors and partially to manage government expenditures it would also get the government out of the business of setting reimbursement rates for thousands of individual procedures call it supply side medicine while the proposal would leave the beneficiary structure intact we suspect that mr mccain is setting up an even bolder reform changing the payment architecture could be used as a lever to move medicare toward a defined contribution health care model where the government would pay a certain amount per individual and private insurance would compete to insure patients this would be a major step toward free market spending discipline mr mccain has largely predicated his candidacy on national security but his entrance into the health care fray solidifies the intellectual progress conservatives have made on the issue this isnt when republicans had little to say the "universal" health care ambitions of hillary clinton and her fellow democrats rest on incremental steps that expand the role of government add more mandates and taxes and eventually create "medicare for all " the stage seems to be set for a rousing and much needed debate next year over the role of government in health care see related letter "letters to the editor outcome based payment for health care has risks" wsj oct
