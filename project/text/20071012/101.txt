union orders the concept of charter schools is popular enough that even most liberals wont attack them openly yet the national political assault continues behind the scenes most recently in ohio where unions have now been caught giving orders to attorney general marc dann who has duly saluted last week the columbus dispatch published emails showing that mr dann and the ohio education association are in cahoots to close down certain charter schools in the state mr dann was elected last november in a democratic sweep that included governor ted strickland and was helped by big labor as a token of his appreciation mr strickland earlier this year proposed placing a moratorium on new charter schools and restrictions on private school vouchers only to be rebuffed by the legislature now its mr danns turn to send a thank you in march the teachers union sued the state alleging that low performing charters should be closed because officials had failed to monitor them properly the ohio supreme court had ruled against the union in a similar case last year yet mr dann offered to settle the case and the union dropped the suit after the ags office agreed to go after charter schools on its own the union even advised a legal strategy for mr dann which was to use the charitable trust status of the schools to argue that they were failing in their mission to educate kids "i know this is a long shot but by any chance are community schools registered as charitable trusts " said a union lawyer in an email to the ags office "if not are they exempt from registration by regulation " "not that im aware of to either " came the reply from mr danns office its no secret that politicians and teachers unions often collaborate to deny school choice to poor and minority students but rarely are their tactics laid this bare the emails show that mr dann and the union also conspired to decide which charters to sue carefully selecting schools that were too poor to fight back on their own so far the ag has targeted just three charter schools in dayton which happens to be the district of jon husted the republican speaker of the house and the legislatures most vocal proponent of school choice but mr dann told the dispatch that "certainly there are or more that scream out for this kind of attention " failing charter schools which are independently run public schools that function outside of the normal education bureaucracy should and do close thats one advantage they have over lousy traditional public schools that stay open indefinitely without ever being held accountable in dayton alone of public school students attend schools that have been graded "d" or "f" by the state no wonder dayton currently has more students per capita in charters than any city other than new orleans in december ohios legislature put in place stronger quality controls requiring chronically underperforming charters to shutter if they receive a failing grade from the state for three consecutive years mr dann is thus trying to pre empt a legislative process already in place and his decision to use the charitable trust status of these schools sets a dangerous precedent if hes successful any nonprofit that the ags office considers a safe political target from hospitals to the united way could be similarly vulnerable whats really animating mr dann and the teachers union is a desire to tarnish the reputation of charters and limit parental choice congratulations to the dispatch for exposing their power play
