business day sign up for the e mail here al gore this morning won the nobel peace prize along with the u n sponsored assembly of scientists whose work this year produced the most official documentation and warnings about man made global warming the norwegian nobel committee said it chose to honor the former american vice president and the intergovernmental panel on climate change because the committee "is seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the worlds future climate and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind " the committee cited the ipccs scientific reports and contributions to an "ever broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming " and mr gores strengthening of "the struggle against climate change" through his film work and political activism together it said they have laid "the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change " mr gore who won the popular vote of the u s presidential election in but nonetheless lost to president bush isnt without controversy among some americans and while even the bush administration which once disputed the reality of global warming has backed the ipcc the nobel committees choice might cause some people to "go into conniptions" this morning as the wall street journal suggests carter wood for example wrote on the national association of manufacturers blog that "gores claim to intellectual prestige and peace props rests on an inconvenient truth his book and alleged documentary on global warming so we note again that the movie is bunk based on conscious distortions of the truth " as it happens the prize comes just a day after a british judge issued a ruling on whether the film is suitable for showing to u k schoolchildren high court judge michael burton called "an inconvenient truth" a "powerful" case that global warming is caused by humans and said teachers could screen it for their students but he said they must alert the students to nine places in the film where mr gore erred including an over alarmist implication about rising sea levels as the washington post reports while the nobel committee made no mention of bush administration skepticism on climate change the message of this years choice seems the latest to be aimed at least in part at the white house mr gore is the second prominent u s democrat to win the award during the bush administration following jimmy carter the laureate international atomic energy agency chief mohamed elbaradei who opposed the invasion of iraq was named at a time when the war had become the biggest point of contention between the u s and the world and the winners american jody williams and her international campaign to ban landmines were chosen at a time when the clinton administration was opposing parts of an international treaty to ban the weapons like mr elbaradei mr gore opposed the iraq invasion before it took place and that along with his leading role on climate change has pushed him to the forefront of speculative democratic candidates for though he isnt running whether todays award changes his mind or even helps a potential gore candidacy international backing is a mixed blessing in american politics it is likely at least to bolster his street cred within the party and add weight to any endorsement he makes virgin goes after northern rock sir richard bransons virgin group today confirmed it is in talks that could lead to the acquisition of northern rock the large
