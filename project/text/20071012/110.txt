weekend journal review theater improper strangers the ritz roundabout theatre company studio w th st new york &# &# closes dec happy days a new musical paper mill playhouse brookside dr millburn n j &# &# closes oct new york terrence mcnally misses the good old days when gay men went to bathhouses to have sex with strangers this nostalgia he claims is sufficiently general that the time is now ripe for the roundabout theatre companys revival of "the ritz " mr mcnallys farce about hijinks in a steambath "this was a play written in a spirit of joy " the playwright told a reporter for the bergen record a new jersey paper the other day "the s were a time of revolution and liberation not just gays but everyone was having a good time " with the aids epidemic seemingly under control in america he thinks that playgoers of all sexual persuasions will find "the ritz" funny once again seeing as how mr mcnally and i have different notions of what constitutes a good time i may not be the ideal person to review "the ritz " on the other hand i love farce but "the ritz" is a big sloppy mess a series of inconsistently amusing sketches loosely strung on a paper thin pretext gaetano kevin chamberlin marries into a family of brooklyn thugs his brother in law carmine lenny venito decides to whack him on general principles to avoid becoming a whackee he jumps in a cab and asks the driver to take him to a place where nobody would dream of looking for him the driver drops him at the front door of a gay steambath which gaetano innocently assumes is an ordinary turkish bath and were off to the races needless to say all this is the stuff of a high speed mistaken identity farce and in the hands of a more disciplined farceur it might well have yielded up loads of laughs the trouble is that mr mcnally has failed to nail the pieces together with the scrupulous precision that farce demands meaning that the second act of "the ritz" fails to build up or pay off with the explosive comic force of such great modern farces as joe ortons "what the butler saw" or michael frayns "noises off " yes its funny but not funny enough it says everything about "the ritz" that the best thing in it is the floor show performed by googie gomez rosie perez a nightclub singer of infinite incompetence who appears nightly at the steambath where the play is set thats the catch mr mcnally gets no credit for this part of "the ritz " since the script says only that googie is "very bad but very funny whatever number googie sings you can be sure that it is the wrong one for her so is the arrangement her costume the choreography the lighting the works " and while ms perez and joe mantello who directed "the ritz " have managed between them to cook up an act so excruciatingly awful that it comes close to stopping the show theres no room in a farce for self contained comic episodes that dont advance the plot as a result every laugh ms perez gets in her big scene slows the action down still further except for some of the actors ms perez and ashlie atkinson in particular the only thing i really liked about "the ritz" was scott pasks set a farce lovers nightmare consisting mainly of red doors most of them eminently slammable would that the roundabout were using it for a fresher play millburn n j speaking of misplaced nostalgia garry marshall and paul williams have come up with a musical version of "happy days " one of the most successful sitcoms of the s perhaps the proper word for this wan production however is meta nostalgic since its a show about a show a sentimental look back at a sentimental look back at america in the s thats an awful lot of sentiment for one musical especially one that doesnt contain a single memorable song all mr williams has to offer is carbon paper pastiche just as all mr marshall has to offer is a plot bland enough to have been pinched from an episode of the sitcom he created in back in the days when most network tv series were as controversial as turkey on white with mayo "happy days" ended its prime time run years ago and i cant help but wonder how many present day playgoers are more than vaguely aware of its characters whatever the answer i suspect it was imprudent for mr marshall to have written a musical that presupposes both familiarity with and affection for the original show on which it is based if you dont already know for instance that the fonz played onstage by joey sorge is an omnipotently cool dude admired by one and all you may have trouble grasping why every character in the show reflexively looks to him to save arnolds drive in the local hangout from being engulfed by the encroaching forces of greed nor are you likely to care since a the plot generated by this premise is wince makingly artificial and b mr marshall cant decide whether to make fun of its patness or play it straight if you think im getting all huffy about a nice piece of fluff please think again i like fluff when its well made i liked for example the musical version of "the wedding singer " whose creators rang a fresh set of changes on adam sandlers movie perhaps not coincidentally felicia finley who played the slutty girlfriend in "the wedding singer " gives a similarly brassy and equally appealing performance as pinky tuscadero the fonzs once and future squeeze "happy days a new musical" picks up a little bit of much needed speed whenever ms finley sashays on stage otherwise it stays stuck in neutral mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at
