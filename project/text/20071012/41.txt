hillarycare the preview president bill clinton famously declared that the era of big government is over after the ill considered scheme to remake american health care his wife helped to cook up in helped republicans retake congress in now hillary clinton is back touting an "american health choices plan " like the earlier fiasco sen clintons current scheme would explode government spending the plans initial price tag is &# billion expand bureaucratic regulation and threaten the health and financial security of millions of americans for sure sen clinton wont make the mistake of releasing pages of details as was done in the s yet even in outline form it is clear that under the plan the government will tell insurance companies how to design their plans and who they must accept as customers businesses will be told that they have to spend money on a benefit that they and their employees may or may not value individuals will be told that they have to spend their money on health insurance the price of which will explode past its already too high level the american health choices plan based on mandates including community rating and guaranteed issue for insurance companies more regulation and increased taxes is not a recipe for cost control but for disaster for proof you need look no further than massachusetts last year then republican gov mitt romney and a democratic legislature enacted a health care plan with very similar elements to the one proposed by sen clinton everyone has to purchase insurance the government regulates the product design companies cannot deny a policy to anyone guaranteed issue or charge rates based on health or lifestyle except for smokers businesses must offer insurance to employees or pay a fine low income residents receive completely free or highly subsidized plans while mr romney has moved on bay state residents are still feeling the aftershocks of the people who have enrolled in the new plans more than have signed up for the free option free to the enrollee if not to taxpayers the plans for which people must pay close to full freight have been about as popular as wool sweaters in august as of sept only people had signed up for these new plans despite the july mandate thats a mere of the estimated eligible uninsured population experts predicted that upwards of of enrollees in the plans with subsidized premiums would be under and fewer than older than in fact were older than depending on the plan this is not surprising since older people are more likely to be heavy users of health insurance the flood of these enrollees is called adverse selection this causes costs to spiral upward and coverage to dwindle this problem was supposed to be addressed by the universal mandate but when the bureaucrats actually began implementing the plan they discovered health insurance is expensive because health care is expensive since they couldnt repeal this reality they repealed the universal mandate exempting of the uninsured from the mandate who was exempted people earning between roughly &# and &# who couldnt afford coverage the lower income earners were not expected under the law to have to spend more than of their earnings on premiums at the high end the cutoff is but insurance turned out to be too expensive for these individuals and the government was out of money for direct subsidies sen clinton claims that her plan would not require a new bureaucracy that is hard to square with the fact that it offers a new government health plan as one option more to the point consider the massachusetts health connector an entity that was supposed to be merely a clearinghouse of private plans but in reality sets the standards for what health plans do and do not pass the state mandate muster necessarily this function would have to be performed by government at the state or national level if ms clintons plan is adopted in massachusetts more than people have been told that their existing health plans arent good enough to pass muster they had until july of this year to buy up or face fines commencing next year costs have turned out to be higher than expected in massachusetts and they promise to keep climbing in a bond filing government officials told wall street that health spending under its plan would increase total state spending by &# million this was before the administration of gov deval patrick in the face of a collapsing coalition pushed &# million more into the plan on a household level citizens have found that their government expects them to spend as much as of their household income on health insurance and then face deductibles and copays these high expenses will erode public support for the program officials active in designing and implementing the plan are fretting publicly about the need to control costs and how failure to do so will cause the scheme to collapse the lesson here is plain for ms clintons plan it already projects an increase in spending of &# billion and unlike the state cannot hide cost increases by shifting some of them to the federal taxpayer the number one problem in american health care is the bouts of uninsurance that many people experience throughout their working life the problem is not caused by too little government the problem is not even in the main caused by poor health the culprit is costly premiums half of uninsured adults are under age mostly healthy and simply dont want to spend the money on a product that they wont use imposing the layers of regulation sought by sen clinton simply increases the cost of insurance making it even less attractive to the uninsured mandating that people and businesses purchase it simply taxes them the answer is not more taxes more costly premiums and more government regulation the solution is tax code changes that create a level playing field between health spending by individuals and groups and between insurance and out of pocket spending we also need to ensure the freedom of people to purchase insurance under the laws of any state president clinton didnt understand this in when he put his wife in charge of remaking the u s health system his party paid a deep price at the ballot box hillary clinton still doesnt get it in this may just keep her from the oval office ms pipes is president and ceo of the pacific research institute and author of "miracle cure how to solve americas health care crisis and why canada isnt the answer " she is a health adviser to the giuliani campaign
