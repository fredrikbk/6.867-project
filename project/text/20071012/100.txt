turkey must own up to armenian genocide its interesting that the wall street journal bastion of free enterprise and u s ideals seems to have a blind spot when it comes to turkey "politics and genocide " review &amp outlook oct after years of work by the armenian community a resolution is co sponsored by members of congress the resolution basically does nothing more than to have the u s government acknowledge the genocide of the armenians by ottoman turkey this is considered an "inappropriate signal to our turkish friends" the same turkish friends who refused to allow the u s military to operate out of our bases in turkey during the iraq invasion and is threatening incursions into kurdish iraq to make sure kurds in turkey know their place i guess our national interests and security dont matter when turkey has internal issues the armenian genocide is an historic fact that turkey refuses to acknowledge a declaration by our government standing against a past injustice should hardly be enough to destroy a relationship that is certainly beneficial to turkey in fact it just may be the act thats needed to prod a country that is trying to join the eu into acknowledging its past misdeeds and moving toward a future based on democracy and personal rights garo kholamian barrington ill i cant quite understand why so many congressmen are against the armenian genocide resolution working its way through the house for fear that it would offend turkey i was taught a long time ago to do the right thing and speak the truth if this offends ones "friends " then they probably arent friends anyway its one of the first lessons most people learn in life and congress should follow it david sayian chevy chase md no one has a problem accepting the jewish holocaust of world war ii as fact when someone like irans president ahmadinejad denies the holocaust there is severe backlash what is different with the armenian case germany made peace with what some germans did more than years ago turkey still has not made peace with its forbears actions years ago how can the u s try to be a beacon of hope and fairness in the world if it will not recognize what any respected historian will state as fact that the actions against the armenians in world war i was an undeniable act of genocide chris manoukian kingston ontario there never is a good time to pass resolutions condemning genocide and apologists for turkey can always claim that times are particularly delicate for bringing up such inconvenient matters condemning the genocide is an american matter as many of the survivors of the genocide emigrated to america not to armenia as an american of armenian descent who served in istanbul with the u s foreign service i can attest firsthand that the turks have neither apologized for nor come to terms with this brutal embarrassing and defining moment in their history your recap of the genocide is too kind to the turkish government not only did the turkish government directly cause a huge number of armenians deaths it benefited from the slaughter by seizing armenians private property the house of my massacred great parents for example is now a government building my family has not received any restitution even though the turkish government has been using the building for almost years until the turkish government makes an apology and provides restitution for the genocide americans should not be hesitant to scold the turks about atoning for their brutal past no matter how sensitive the time l a eldemir san francisco
