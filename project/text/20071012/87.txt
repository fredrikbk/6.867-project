tangling with the taliban paktika province afghanistan gen john craddock sits in dwight eisenhowers old chair at the head of nato forces a tank commander the west virginia native spent years in germany faced off against the russians the other day half a world away from the fulda gap he found himself at the improvised hilltop base of a u s nd airborne platoon peering across a different sort of front line beyond these wooded hills and ravines are the pakistani sanctuaries for the taliban and al qaeda whove in recent months crossed mostly at night in growing numbers the u s doubled the number of combat troops in eastern afghanistan and the nd airborne part of the strong nato mission here opened three new border posts the boosted presence partly accounts for the intense fighting "were more offensive not just waiting to be hit " an american lieutenant colonel on his second tour tells gen craddock but this is a frustrating game of hide and seek where the enemy is hard to spot is that goat herder also an al qaeda lookout and the insurgency leadership a jumble of names and allegiances southeast of kabul seasoned arab uzbek and chechen foreigners command afghans referring to them sometimes as "sheep " according to command sgt maj richard weik further north men loyal to jalaluddin haqqani a powerful jihadist who joined up with the taliban are in the lead brazenly kidnapping and harassing villagers and manning roadblocks not far from kabul gen craddock separates the taliban estimated between and strong into "day fighters " who take up arms for money and "a hard core extremist leadership that will never change " what fuels the rising violence in afghanistan may be as much indigence and tribal feuding as al qaeda ideology hamid karzais government pushes economic development and reaches out to so called taliban moderates with little to show for it and the supply of fighters foreign and afghan wont dry up as long as western pakistan provides the kind of safe haven that america pledged to destroy after minutes after gen craddock lifts off from the border post in his blackhawk a rocket set on a timer hit harmlessly in the hill below whoever planted it he tells me later "didnt stick around" when gis rushed over to investigate the day before in a bare and sandbagged reception hall gen craddock sat with ezatullah the district governor of sangin which saw some of the worst fighting in southern afghanistan helmand province boasts the highest concentration of taliban who claim to have the run of half of it "the center of taliban activity is in musa qala " ezatullah tells his visitor referring to a city north of sangin under taliban control "thats where they make ieds improvised explosive devices " which along with suicide bombings and other terrorist tactics were recently imported whether directly isnt clear from iraq he wants nato forces to act gen craddock listens politely and makes no promises the politics are sensitive ezatullah who goes by a single name is a local strongman with a "checkered past " in the words of a british briefer installed by kabul after u k troops at a cost of men took sangin the british resist pressure sometimes from america to move against musa qala why take it if you cant keep it asked maj gen jacko page the commander of nato forces in the south he tells me that musa qala "isnt a safe haven " but a target "there isnt a silver bullet to end this campaign " says maj gen page "we cant be seen as an occupation force its not about controlling ground its not about killing people the primary agent is the government itself " afghan "ownership" is a nice idea and good p r reality is another story gov ezatullah struggles alone to run his district the foreigners recently hired him a clerk his first employee police lack regular salaries from kabul so live off bribes as a result nato troops who claim to play only a supporting role are forced to step in and provide basic services the six british patrol bases near sangin are "the equivalent of having a police station in your town " says one british officer the troops clear irrigation ditches and get local bazaars up and running "if we cant offer more than the enemy weve lost from the start " says helen gates the civilian deputy head of the "provincial reconstruction team" responsible for sangin musa qala like sangin a district center is on the other side of enemy lines how it got there is sobering nato last year struck a deal with town elders british troops whod taken the town would leave as long as the locals kept the taliban out british gen david richards who commanded nato forces in afghanistan then says the british flag was a "magnet" for the taliban and wanted to show that afghans were ready to take over the absence of a flag was a bigger magnet in february four months after the deal was struck and the british decamped the taliban took musa qala back gen craddock tells me the "ideal is that nato clears the afghans hold" territory but in the south the taliban are proving resilient in spite of losing thousands of fighters and getting routed in any conventional battle with british american or canadian forces theyre in cahoots with drug lords who give them money weapons say diplomats and military officials now also come from iran the talibans erstwhile enemies gen craddock argues natos decision to move forcefully into the south has been a success "there has been a resurgence of the taliban " he explains "to the extent that it was there before and nato soldiers walked into places where no nato forces have been we stirred up a hornets nest " a few days after we leave sangin the taliban kidnap a year old boy walking home from work copying keys at the town market they call him "a spy " beat and hang him stuffing five one dollar bills found in his pocket into his mouth i first met gen craddock in when he led the u s st infantry division into southern kosovo in the wake of natos bombing campaign against serbia as in bosnia the kosovo mission was criticized as a distraction for troops trained to fight the next big war later he was donald rumsfelds military adviser during the iraq war and went on to lead the u s southern command which oversees guantanamo and colombian drug interdiction efforts as supreme allied commander for europe gen craddock is again preoccupied with asymmetric threats when he rose up the ranks he says "i didnt expect to spend so much time thinking about drug lords culture religion " as it turned out the experience that gen craddock got in kosovo was very useful post these post conflict colonial missions take time the outside world is trying to construct not reconstruct a more or less functioning state yet time is a scarce resource given the attention spans and patience of people back home still gen craddock pleads for more time "to get the afghan police army bureaucracy to stand up and get the job done themselves " "i dont think that were losing " he says "question is are we winning fast enough " mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
