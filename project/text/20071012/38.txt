ms eikenberry hasnt bought anything on the auction web site since she snagged a pair of miu miu boots in she has often returned to ebay since then but overwhelmed by cluttered pages filled with countless choices she hasnt bothered to bid "its too much work at the end of the day " says the portland resident besides she says she is nervous that she could end up with a counterfeit item for her she says "theyre not a trusted retailer " ebay now a year old e commerce company is in the midst of changing its site to lure back consumers particularly past customers like ms eikenberry who havent shopped there regularly with more than million registered users the san jose calif company is running into a problem that many mature consumer goods makers have contended with before how to get its already large customer base to buy again and more frequently to achieve that goal ebay has been focusing more on the needs of the buyers on its site in addition to those of sellers who pay fees to trade it has tried to make its design simpler and its search results more precise adding criteria like size and color so that buyers dont have to scroll through so many items when they shop to root out scams and low quality merchandise it has added more detailed ratings for sellers it restricts the selling privileges of lower rated sellers or cuts them off entirely ebay says of sellers are responsible for of the negative buying experiences on the site when ebay began making the changes last year it was still growing but its growth was slowing in the second quarter of revenue growth rates in its u s auction and marketplace business had declined to from the previous year the number of active users people who had bid bought or listed an item for sale in the last year had risen to million a increase over the previous year but the rate of growth had slowed from the previous years increase of the changes have rankled some merchants who say they have lost business as a result after kevin harmon a dvd and videogame seller on ebay began selling used merchandise along with his regular inventory of new products last year he received some bad ratings for damaged or defective dvds and videogames he says ebay put him on its "watch list " notifying him that his sales would be restricted if he didnt get his feedback ratings up in days it took the matthews n c merchant five months to get off the watch list he improved his ratings by inspecting and repairing defective discs doubling his customer service employees to four and giving full refunds to anyone who complained of a defective product while he is still on ebay he also launched his own web site and started selling on sites like amazon "there have been good high quality sellers who have been caught up" in ebays system of penalizing low rated vendors says tom mersch an ebay consumer electronics seller and a director of an ebay sellers trade group called professional ebay sellers alliance these sellers he says "are certainly not part of creating a negative buying experience on ebay " john donahoe president of ebays auction and marketplace business and the driving force behind ebays recent changes says ebay is evolving to keep pace with a more mature e commerce environment while sellers will be given the same opportunities he says "were going to emphasize and reward our best sellers the ones who arent will deal with the consequences or receive less exposure " in mid mr donahoe who is viewed as a contender to succeed to ebay chief executive meg whitman reviewed the auction business and decided it "hadnt kept up" with the times he says late last year he restructured his engineering product and marketing teams into groups focused on the customers and sellers experience to fight fraud ebay put restrictions on sellers who wanted to sell items such as luxury handbags which are vulnerable to counterfeiting these sellers now have to be verified with paypal ebays payment service and are limited in the volume of items they can sell ebay began displaying more detailed seller ratings in march with evaluations from buyers on factors like shipping time and how closely the products matched their descriptions in may it introduced new technology to make search results more accurate that same month ebay unveiled "bid assistant" and "ebay to go " two features that allow users to monitor bids on multiple items and to display and link to ebay content from a personal web site or blog two months ago ebay redesigned its home page to be less cluttered cutting down on the amount of text images and scrolling headlines the company says it doesnt expect the changes to affect its financial results right away in the second quarter of revenue for the sites u s and international auction business rose to &# billion up from a year ago gross merchandise volume the total value of all goods sold on the site rose overall and two points for the u s but the growth of active users which hit million in the second quarter continues to slow it rose in the second quarter down from in the year before listings declined from the previous year ebay reports its third quarter results wednesday the departure and diminished participation of some merchants on ebay could result in a short term drop in the companys revenue since ebay receives a fee every time an item is listed for sale and each time a sales transaction closes but some merchants applaud the changes jarrod krug who sells designer shoes on ebay has implemented the new "ebay to go" feature among others to sell his merchandise already he says
