by collectors historians and even tv producers to weigh in on controversies her current preoccupation finding lost or unidentified photos of people who lived during the revolutionary war ms taylor who charges &# an hour has learned to spot details that reveal not only a photos period but the story behind it a broom at the feet of a couple in a mid th century portrait for instance often marks it as a wedding picture a photograph of a baby in a carriage from the s might not be a birth announcement but a death card in that period of high infant mortality dead infants were commonly photographed in carriages a th century woman with unusually short hair may have had scarlet fever because it was common to shave a victims head the most satisfying cases ms taylor says are those that reunite people with lost pieces of their past when her year old mother moved into a nursing home cassie horner a year old free lance writer in plymouth vt inherited more than photographs most of which were unidentified in february ms horner and a cousin hired ms taylor to analyze the images especially a tintype of two women and a baby ms taylor dated the photo within two years of its creation just by flipping it over she recognized a civil war tax stamp that was used from aug to aug with that time period the cousins determined one woman was their great grandmother myalina gage the eldest of children with her younger sister malinda the baby was likely one of myalinas children who died for years brad leonard of missoula mont puzzled over the contents of an album he believed had belonged to

snowy days by studying old family photos from her mothers closet after earning a history degree in she joined the rhode island historical society where she worked as an assistant photo curator and genealogical researcher to augment her &# salary she took up a paper route in the mornings she worked on genealogy poring over family records and church rosters afternoons were devoted to studying nuances of old photos like tintypes theyre made of iron so magnets will stick to them and daguerreotypes they have reflective surfaces like mirrors when the photos are well preserved she says "the people look like theyre so real they could step out of the frame " there are currently about half a dozen family historians who specialize in dating images by clothing photographic style or props some are using scientific methods to date photos rather than focusing on details like clothing colleen fitzpatrick an optical scientist and genealogist who also studies handwriting tries to answer questions about photographs by measuring shadows which might hint at what time of day they were taken or by measuring the dimensions of photos to determine what kind of camera was used kathleen hinckley executive director of the association of professional genealogists says ms taylor has risen to the top of the field by bridging the disciplines of genealogy art history costume history and cultural anthropology the first popular photographs daguerreotypes appeared in france and england in the s these small reflective metal images typically have protective cases and can last hundreds of years the medium proved immensely popular by the s studios made ambrotypes images captured on glass with a mixture of ether and gun cotton tintypes photos made by coating iron plates with light sensitive chemicals and card photographs prints mounted on cardboard when candid photography arrived in with the invention of the kodak snapshot family collections swelled with shots of christenings birthdays and everyday scenes problematically few people thought to label them today old photographs sit in attics or unlabeled boxes at antiques fairs and thrift shops or drift unclaimed on ebay some web sites hawk unidentified portraits branding them "instant ancestors " while others specialize in reuniting orphaned photos with their families one site deadfred com has a database with more than abandoned photos dating back as far as more than have been claimed one client of ms taylors a new york artist asked her to determine whether one of the four men in an photo was jesse james using a technique shed found in a book by a former cia analyst ms taylor studied the shape of the mans right ear and compared it to photos known to be of james a bump on the mans helix combined with a receding hairline and narrow jaw identified him as the infamous outlaw on a typical morning ms taylor is at her desk by scanning photos uploaded to her web site or submitted by email she often prints or so and tacks them on her bulletin board to mull over sometimes they stare back at her for months one troublesome photograph of a woman in a dress whose style was difficult to date stayed on her board for a year before ms taylor hit upon the answer the woman who was likely poor had resewn the dress several times ms taylor is a compulsive collector of obscure reference books one of her prize finds was an geographical dictionary called the lippincott gazetteer of the world and has floor to ceiling bookcases filled with guides to gravestone markers buttons shoes victorian costumes encyclopedias of united states army uniforms quilt pattern catalogs encyclopedias of paper products fabric swatches stamp books a manual on the symbolism of fraternal organizations and a guide to photo fakery written by a former official at the cias national photographic interpretation center shes constantly scavenging for old photographs and has amassed an entire closet full of antique photos from flea markets antique fairs and online auction sites among them is a cardboard box of th century family portraits that she bought two years ago at an antiques fair in brimfield mass each photograph is labeled according to the persons relationship to a mystery woman named louise "i havent gotten to it yet " says ms taylor whos tall and slim with icy blue eyes "i still have to find louise " when an answer cant be found in one of her books or in images shes already identified and dated she hunts down other experts to learn about horticulture medical photography or th century weapons sometimes her conclusions topple well established family lore marjorie osterhout a free lance writer in seattle was fairly certain shed found a photo of a relative whod served in the civil war see image on weekend journal cover the thin stern looking gentleman wears an ammunition belt and poses with a rifle and a black dog at his feet she learned she had a tintype a cheap durable photograph civil war soldiers often mailed home to relatives in june she submitted the image to ms taylor to test the theory and an answer arrived three days later the photograph did fit the civil war period but the mans high crowned leather cap differed from the uniform caps soldiers wore his strange lace up shirt wasnt part of a military uniform or even a work shirt a military expert helped ms taylor determine that the gun which appears to be an model winchester repeating rifle was not military issue looking beyond the soldiers in her family ms osterhout found a match samuel downs of vineland n j a blacksmith who for reasons that remain unknown did not serve in the civil war despite being the right age mr downs might have been posing in his hunting gear "i didnt know we had a hunter in the family " ms osterhout says ms taylor gives about lectures a year has a column in family tree magazine and writes books including "uncovering your ancestry through family photographs" her latest quest may well be her most ambitious using census records ms taylor and a colleague david lambert are tracking down photos of revolutionary war veterans who lived to see the photography era in the late s so
