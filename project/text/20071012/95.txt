the prosecutor and the salesman if youd told voters that would see two supposedly liberal northeast republicans duking it out for the title of most conservative someone probably would have come to take your temperature and yet its a good year for supply siders when a former new york mayor and a former massachusetts governor are going mano a mano over who is the baddest tax cutter east of the mississippi mr giuliani calls mr romney the governor from "taxachusetts " mr romney who has bragged that hes the only candidate to sign the anti tax pledge says he thinks the former mayors claims to be the better fiscal conservative are "baloney " you know that hurts the fiscal issue has come front and center because the immediate prize is new hampshire where mr giuliani has shaved mr romneys summertime lead to a dead heat granite state voters have always been a tracking stock for economic conservatives and with a good group of conservative economic advisers mr romney is on the offensive running a series of radio ads and statements intended to build his brand as the natural heir to reaganesque economic policies whether the former massachusetts governor has the chops to win this particular fight is another question anti tax groups like the club for growth have been lukewarm on his record the cato institute gave him a "c" on its governors report card in a grade that report author steve slivinski says indicates a "placeholder governor" not doing any major harm but not doing much good either on the campaign trail hes talked a good game hes pledged a continuation of the bush tax cut policies making the tax cuts permanent eliminating the death tax and so on the bad he refused to endorse the same bush tax cuts in as governor and loudly opposed the flat tax the ugly he raised fees and closed "loopholes" in the business tax code effectively increasing the tax burden in massachusetts and his biggest accomplishment was a dubious one passing a state health care plan that strikes a lot of democrats as a good national model some of that may be a product of his environment hopefully a lot of it his campaign has made much of the fact that his accomplishments in the bay state came despite having to wrangle with an opposition legislature he held the line on new broad based taxes during the states budget crisis in not an easy feat and he gets credit for fighting to a standstill a bill that would have retroactively hiked capital gains taxes battling the massachusetts democratic legislature was undoubtedly tough but mr romney wasnt the first or the most successful in taking it on over fiscal issues that honor goes to his predecessor former gov paul cellucci mr cellucci couldnt get a tax cut through the legislature either so he found another way to do it he went to the voters putting a referendum on the ballot in and winning the income tax reductions that occurred during mr romneys own governorship began with the cellucci ballot measure did we mention that mr cellucci has endorsed rudy giuliani yeah thats a little awkward though mr cellucci has been at pains to say hes not trying to stick it to mitt he just thinks rudy did a better job than mitt did and is better qualified than mitt is no offense or anything what is mr giulianis claim to fame for pro growth fiscal conservatives he has made hay of the alleged fact that he cut taxes times while mayor of new york longtime city hall watchers say touting the number needlessly exaggerates a pretty classy record before his time in office no mayor of new york city had ever made tax cutting a priority yet he did it every year with pretty decent results having taken office with a &# billion deficit he executed a total turnaround of the citys economy leaving residents with the lowest tax burden they had seen in three decades new york citys growth rate well outpaced the national average even in a strong economy but the former mayor is not without his own dancing fiscal skeletons in hizzoner criticized then gov george patakis big income tax cut as potentially ruinous to the city echoing the contentions of his chief democratic rival mario cuomo whom he had endorsed against mr pataki jack kemp campaigning for gov pataki at the time was flummoxed rudy may share our conservative economic principles the supply side saint told a buffalo newspaper but then he turns around and supports "mr tax and spend liberal it hurts the party and confuses people " far from backing down the mayor shot back that he was a much better judge of the interests of the city he was elected to serve an equally unsightly scenario played out when he opposed getting rid of the citys income tax surcharge in the late s putting him to the left of democratic city council member peter vallone but mr giuliani did plenty of good too he fought for hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts for the city and didnt mince words doing it in october of facing the economic devastation of september reporters asked the departing mayor why he didnt go ahead and raise taxes to fill the budget shortfall because he answered that would be a "dumb stupid idiotic and moronic" idea the bottom line both men are pretty b+ we grade on a curve around here both have good but imperfect tax records and both have a serious albatross mr giuliani ended up on the wrong side of the line item veto fight by suing to prevent its use by president clinton the massachusetts governor gave national democrats a free preview of hillarycare but its also fair to note that mr giuliani while citing the constitution was protecting new york citys interest in federal pork mr romneys health care plan on the other hand seemed more like a ploy to raise his presidential profile in the national media if elected either man would find himself in familiar territory with both houses of congress likely controlled by democrats and possibly even by a wider margin than they currently are mr giuliani is a prosecutor mr romney is a salesman which would nancy pelosi prefer supply siders might answer that question for themselves and then choose the other one ms levy is a senior editorial writer at the journal based in washington see related
