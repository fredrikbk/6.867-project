weekend journal tastings a cool gift for wine lovers small refrigerators bring home wines everyday pleasures were already receiving holiday catalogs and because wine is suddenly hip they include all sorts of wine related presents that are silly useless and often expensive so before you make a big mistake on a wine related gift this season we want to share with you the perfect present a small wine cooler yeah we know that sounds about as exciting as getting a new skillet for mom but this is a present that really can change somebodys life and thanks to growing interest in wine and more competition in this little niche there are some fine wine refrigerators out there at very reasonable prices many people even people who enjoy wine dont keep a single bottle in the house theyve been so terrified by stories about the necessity of "perfect storage" that they buy one bottle at a time for dinner that night this means that too often people skip wine with dinner because they dont get around to picking up a bottle it also means their choices are often rushed sadly some people who do keep bottles around the house for dinner figure the kitchen is a perfect place for them so they leave them in little wine racks under bright lights or even on top of the refrigerator where everyone can see them as they slowly cook in the heat truth is if you are simply keeping a dozen bottles around for dinner over the next couple of weeks a wine cooler certainly isnt essential put the wine on its side maybe in the box in which it was packed in a dark undisturbed place with a fairly constant moderate temperature and it will be fine but a little wine cooler is so much better and you can indeed keep it in your kitchen so the wine becomes part of the whole mealtime ritual as it should the advantage of a to bottle wine cooler isnt that it provides great long term storage though it could no the great thing about this is that you or your lucky gift recipient can buy wine by the mixed case therefore usually receiving a to discount you will always have a bottle on hand that will be perfect for dinner tonight and the wine you choose will always be somewhere around serving temperature whenever you want it sure the whites might need a slight bath in ice water and the reds might need to warm up a bit in the glass but cellar temperature is a good starting point for serving both reds and whites so when you call the wine will be ready for several years we have used a danby bottle wine cooler that we keep under a counter in our kitchen we have two other much larger cellars but we use this for wines we expect to drink soon either for tastings or for not so special weekday dinners it has been reliable makes no noise that we can hear and is nice to have in the kitchen we didnt put much thought into buying this model because there werent many choices when we got it has that changed we decided to find out we looked for wine coolers that held at least bottles and cost less than &# we quickly found six in various sizes and with various features big retailers including kmart wal mart and target offer them in almost every case we saw the same cooler at several places with competitive prices three good places to begin a search for a small cooler are wineenthusiast com winecoolers com and beveragefactory com youll get a good idea whats out there and about how much they cost then shop around we tested our six refrigerators for several weeks one thing we noticed right away was that two had compressors while four were thermoelectric we wondered what the difference might be so we called john ouseph an engineer at ge consumer &amp industrial in louisville ky who is an expert in refrigeration and systems manager for ges side by side refrigerators he explained that compressors are more efficient than thermoelectric which is why theyre used in larger refrigerators but thermoelectric units are solid state with no moving parts which should mean less vibration he suggested we test this by putting glasses of water on top and indeed the units with compressors had just a touch more vibration but not enough to bother us he pointed out that units with compressors are heavier and disposal of them is more of an issue because you need to dispose of the refrigerant when buying a small wine cooler should any of this matter to you as a consumer "no to very little " he said "both will cool a small size wine cooler when you get to bigger sizes then the thermoelectrics are not as efficient then it becomes an issue and youd prefer to use a compressor " having tested all of the coolers the truth is wed be happy with any of them though we did have favorites they are listed in order of preference in the attached index there are some notes about them in general that you might want to keep in mind first after spending &# or more on the cooler its worth investing &# in a little thermometer to go inside of it most of these simply have dials on the back to set the temperature to something like "minimum" or "maximum" and it takes some trial and error to figure out where you might want the dial even those with a more sophisticated dial were generally off by a few degrees tastes differ on the "optimal" cellar temperature we prefer degrees but others like their cellars a little warmer or cooler second these generally work best with traditional bordeaux or burgundy bottles than with larger bottles such as champagne or some rhone wines look at them carefully with that in mind maybe take a bottle with you if youre going to have a look the most important thing to keep in mind is that these should always be full the whole point here is to have an ever changing inventory of wine in there to enjoy on a moments notice with a lovely mixed case of everyday drinkables sitting right there in the kitchen just about begging you to pop them open it seems likely that the wines really will be drunk every day which will make meals more fun and life a little better what is the first mixed case wed stuff into the cooler well write about that next week melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones wine cooler index here are six small wine coolers that hold at least bottles and cost less than &# several of these are available at additional retailers but listed below are the places we got them and how much they cost when we bought them online shipping and taxes are extra with our assistant melanie grayce west we tested each of these for several weeks and although each had pros and cons we liked all of them generally they are listed in order of our favorites dimensions in inches are based on our own measurements and in some cases differ slightly from those given by the manufacturer one note except for the magic chef we wish the glass doors on all of these were more darkly tinted because we bought these three months ago for testing prices and availability may have changed wine enthusiast bottle silent wine refrigerator &# at wine enthusiast wineenthusiast com dimensions h w d cooling system thermoelectric best overall fits bottles easily very quiet and a nice manageable size the only one of the six with a visible digital temperature control and while it isnt completely accurate ours ran about four degrees off at least its simple to adjust overall we liked this quite a bit because of the temperature control and clean design a kitchen design plus unit comes in all bronze or in a black unit with a stainless steel graphite or copper trimmed door avanti bottle thermoelectric wine cooler &# at target target com dimensions h w d cooling system thermoelectric very quiet a nice size unit and bottles fit snugly but you have to juggle slots for a good fit top right slot wont fit champagne or riesling temperatures ran about five degrees cooler than the user manual suggested but the temperature dial is more sophisticated than most others there is a silly light inside that you need to move bottles to switch on why bother this is a winner because its easy on the eyes fairly lightweight and has good capacity koolatron slim bottle wine cooler &# at winecoolers com winecoolers com dimensions h w d cooling system thermoelectric nice stand alone design tall narrow and ideal for under counter placement very quiet fan fits bottles but requires some finagling wide bottles need to be on top shelf primitive dial thermometer wasnt accurate at any setting the warmest temperature we could reach with the unit was just degrees the manual says it should reach degrees plus or minus five degrees we called koolatron customer support which advised us to send the unit back for a replacement if it worked properly this would be melanies favorite because she felt the design would work best in a smaller kitchen danby bottle wine cooler &# at wal mart walmart com dimensions h w d cooling system compressor great price reliable though not as attractive as some others and a bit bulky ours arrived with a slightly skewed door leveling the unit was a challenge and you might need some shims it doesnt really hold bottles unless you jam them in but fit comfortably this isnt very elegant but its hard to beat the price magic chef bottle deluxe wine cooler &# at home depot homedepot com dimensions h w d cooling system compressor heavy unit that seems clumsy like a modified dorm fridge snugly fits bottles temperature setting is unsophisticated best to simply use a thermometer compressor is quiet and there is only a little vibration nicely tinted door this is perfectly acceptable but no more haier bottle thermal electric wine cellar &# at kmart kmart com dimensions h w d cooling system thermoelectric very small unit best designed for countertops or credenzas or in our case desktops thermoelectric motor is nearly silent but the unit just didnt give us bang for the buck the turn dial thermostat is designed with a two option setting of "white wine" or "red wine " a customer service agent told us that the range could be anywhere from to degrees some of our wider bottles didnt fit that well and slipped out of the racks plus the unit didnt have the strongest door seal we were least impressed with this cooler
