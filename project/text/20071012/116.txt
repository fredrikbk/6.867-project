that time period according to lawrence yun chief economist for nar foreign businesses bought &# billion of u s real estate in up from a year earlier according to the u s bureau of economic analysis while those numbers refer mostly to commercial and industrial properties experts say they suggest increased interest in the residential market too jonathan miller research director for new york based radar logic a data and analytics firm estimates that purchases by international buyers now make up as much as of all manhattan apartment sales double their share two years ago the foreign infusion has helped keep new york sales strong even amid a shaky credit market and falling wall street earnings mr miller says in las vegas foreign money is helping to bail out areas that were overrun by short term investors during the real estate run up "thank god for the european buyers " say shanda sumpter an agent there with coldwell banker premier realty who now focuses exclusively on foreign investors "theyre coming in and theyre cleaning up what the speculatory investors did to our market " the increase in foreign buyers comes as the u s housing market continues to struggle existing home sales fell in august to a seasonally adjusted rate of million the lowest number in five years according to the nar a month supply of unsold homes is now on the market the association predicts sales will begin to recover in the second quarter of next year but many economists expect the downturn to last into or beyond real estate markets in much of europe meanwhile are booming leading some investors to fear a bubble the average price of a home in greater london for example was gbp about &# in august up over the previous year according to the land registry of england and wales "its sort of time to take some of the money off the table says conor headon a year old irish mobile phone executive who says he owns several properties in his home country "the question is what do you do with it " for mr headon the place to put his money is the u s where he says the weak dollar and slow housing market make it an attractive time to invest he and three friends are planning a real estate shopping trip to boston next month "i would think that well have come back having collectively bought about condos " mr headon says for other international buyers the weak dollar offers a chance to pick up something at a discount in miami a relatively modest three bedroom house with a pool is on the market for &# a comparable property near cannes in france also with three bedrooms also with a pool and with a similar size house and lot is listed for euros &# a more than premium calgary alberta resident verna shewchuk says she and her husband dennis had been considering buying a vacation home in a golf community in the u s for several years before making an offer on a &# million home in scottsdale ariz in june they closed on the property three months later when the canadian dollar was valued at about u s cents one of the best rates in years still it wasnt as good as a month later when the loonie passed the u s dollar in value it is now at us&# "if wed waited a month it would have been even better for us " ms shewchuk says christopher mayer a columbia university professor and director of the paul milstein center for real estate warns foreign investors to think twice about comparing u s prices to those in their home countries for example despite recent discounts residential properties in miami may still be overvalued even if they are far cheaper than equivalent homes in the south of france "one of the mistakes foreign buyers make is to put things in the context of their local market " mr mayer says "when you see foreign buyers in a market where locals are not buying thats a troubling sign " in fact some may be getting wary new york appraiser jeffrey jackson says that since august he has "sensed a bit of a change in attitude " with foreigners taking a closer look before they buy real estate agents are working hard to attract buyers like mr headon and ms shewchuk miami agent michael valdes says he recently visited moscow to woo prospective customers there and neal sroka the agent in charge of corcoran groups international division now travels to investor shows a year including ones in dubai and korea "im basically spending most of my time bringing the u s market to the foreign buyers rather than waiting for them to come here " mr sroka says developers are making similar efforts in chicago shelbourne development group hired the united kingdom real estate firm savills to handle international sales of its floor condo tower the chicago spire currently under construction lake nona a master planned community near orlando fla recently shifted of its advertising budget overseas five of the properties the company has sold since may have been to buyers in the u k and the developers behind trump soho a condo hotel going up in manhattan made a similar decision after the project drew early interest from foreign buyers julius schwarz executive vice president of bayrock group lead developer on the project says the company is allocating an additional of its marketing budget to overseas sales foreign buyers are particularly attractive because they tend to put more money down and are therefore less likely to walk away from deals garrett kenney a developer and real estate agent in florida who has many customers in england and his native ireland says most of his overseas buyers put down compared with the usual down payment by many americans and because they tend to be wealthy foreign buyers are also more likely to pay entirely in cash significant at a time when many deals are falling through because of the credit crunch in the nar survey of foreigners paid cash for their purchases compared with just of americans lissette calderon chief executive of florida developer neo says some pay a units full purchase price upfront even though only a preconstruction down payment is required the reason they want to lock in todays low exchange rates of course such thinking assumes that the dollar will eventually strengthen if it continues to fall foreigners who buy now could see their investments lose value thats not deterring real estate shoppers like uwe braun however after years of waiting for the overheated miami market to cool off and the exchange rate to improve mr braun an executive for a german wholesaler says he is finally ready to make an offer on a roughly &# million condo near the beach "i think the timing is right " he says
