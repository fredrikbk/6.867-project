until today i had never heard of mr yuk created in at the pittsburgh poison center at childrens hospital of pittsburgh mr yuk is really a just glorified scowling green circle sticking out his tongue he was designed as an alternative to the skull and bones long used as a warning on poison bottles unfortunately its resemblance to the flag known as the jolly roger attracted some kids because of its well known associations to the pirate life while he has been used for years to steer kids away from potential poisoning mr yuk according to the associated press is still a copyrighted property of the

to amend the city charter theres no lawsuit yet "its just that this guy is using mr yuk inappropriately and illegally hes broken copyright laws its clearly a violation " said edward krenzelok director of the pittsburgh poison center mr bakken a lawyer defended his right to mr yuk "it appeared to be in the public domain " he said "if this is genuinely harming the good work that they do i sincerely apologize " the associated press contributed to this report write to matt phillips at matt phillips wsj com
