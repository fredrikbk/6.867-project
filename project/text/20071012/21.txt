compromise bill sets up a less expensive schip we were dismayed by the mischaracterization of the childrens health insurance reauthorization act of in your sept editorial "schip for everyone " you did not accurately portray the work and diligence that went into crafting this truly bipartisan compromise which passed the senate twice with republican senators voting "aye " due to our participation the bill is significantly less expensive than the schip reserve fund in the democrats budget prohibits state waivers for covering adult men and non pregnant women and refocuses on low income children by cutting federal matching dollars to states covering those over of poverty in order to find and cover even half of the six million eligible but unenrolled kids the congressional budget office said we needed to spend more money than the president proposed assertions that the bill expands coverage to higher income children are baseless in fact the bill puts tremendous pressure on states to not cover higher incomes just like now the only way a state may cover higher income families is with administration approval which the bush administration has given repeatedly we want this practice to stop so our bill specifically targets schip coverage to low income children it says that if states cover higher income families over of poverty then the money they get from the federal government is cut and by they get no funding for such coverage if the state isnt covering most of its low income children this is not an entitlement program the legislation passed by the house would have turned schip into an uncapped entitlement but the compromise bill maintains the senate position for a capped block grant sen orrin g hatch r utah sen chuck grassley r iowa washington
