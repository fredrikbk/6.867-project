case ms applegate gets her chance as samantha who wakes up from a car accident coma with no memory of her past she learns that she has parents a beau and a best friend named andrea but the devil is in the details and as aspects of her prior life and personality are revealed to her samantha is horrified she hasnt spoken to her parents in two years her boyfriend doesnt like her and her best friend is not only a boozy airhead but her only friend the old samantha was an addict too partial proof of which includes a closet full of shoes and &# in credit card debt as for work it is a nest of vipers none more predatory than the pre accident sam "samantha who " is not screamingly funny but it isnt trying to be it doesnt hit us over the head with gags and blessedly doesnt rely on raunch in that sense its a bit old fashioned which in todays tv universe makes it seem light and fresh like the entrancing ms applegate herself lifetime no longer calls itself television for women but a lot of women watch it and apparently their appetites have changed although housewives in crisis can still be seen on lifetime so can the ghosts of dead people along with vampires and other spooky creatures the latter include some of the contestants on "americas psychic challenge" monday p m the show features people who profess to have psychic abilities some are professional mediums while others just dabble each week four compete in tests of their powers and the winners advance toward the championship round needless to say but i will anyway the majority of the contestants are women they include karyn described as a former stockbroker with a "corporate style" of reading people through spirits the "telekinetic" robin who says that she predicted the death of anna nicole smith then theres gay jeff who works as a "medical intuitive and empath " my personal favorite is jackie her bio on a lifetime press release describes her as a member of the voodoo spiritual temple of new orleans "known as the healer " in person however jackie identifies herself as "the white serpent " and that sounds more like it you dont want to mess with jackie at one point when the shows host is being less than friendly she circles him slowly while hissing an unsolicited reading "i would watch the cholesterol but i think you know about that right " just when you thought there was nothing more to be milked from the
