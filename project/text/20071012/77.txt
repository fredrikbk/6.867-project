politics &amp economics dissenters in canadas arctic government move to beef up military makes inuit wary resolute nunavut prime minister stephen harpers pledge this summer to spend more than seven billion canadian dollars us&# billion to defend the canadian arctic was met in the countrys south with broad support and some nationalistic fist pumping but among the sliver of canadians who live in this barren landscape of unbroken horizons and frozen winds his promise is stirring up more resentment than pride "the government isnt even meeting the basic needs of the communities " says mary simon president of the inuit tapiriit kanatami a national inuit organization in nunavut where mr harper intends to build a deep sea port and a military training base the suicide rate is times the national average and three out of four students dont graduate from high school an inuit organization last year filed suit against the federal government over its failure to live up to its promise to hire inuits for government jobs local delegates to the canadian parliament have criticized mr harpers arctic priorities but their numbers are so small it has made little difference broader economic and security issues are behind mr harpers push for a stronger military presence in the arctic the national snow and ice data center estimates that levels of arctic sea ice have fallen as much as in the past half century that may open the northwest passage for consistent seasonal commercial transportation the u s geological survey says the arctic could contain as much as of the worlds undiscovered oil reserves nations with territory in the arctic notably russia and the u s are jockeying for position and canada wants to establish its presence mr harper called for six to eight new ice cutters to patrol the northwest passage a new training base in resolute for canadian soldiers to learn how to fight and survive in the far north and a refurbished deep sea arctic port in nearby nanisivik the items will be included in next years federal budget "canada has a choice when it comes to defending our sovereignty over the arctic " mr harper said in a speech in july "we either use it or lose it and make no mistake this government intends to use it " in an august poll of canadians said they thought the government should invest heavily in claiming sovereignty over arctic territory although most canadians have never traveled above the arctic circle the notion of the "true north strong and free" that is celebrated in the countrys national anthem is central to canadian identity says michael byers a professor of international law at the university of british columbia but mr harpers speech played differently in nunavut where the inuit have spent thousands of years carving out an existence in a forbidding climate except for the occasional european whaler they have until recently been almost entirely isolated during world war ii and then the cold war canada and the u s feared an attack from the north they built a string of airstrips and radar stations across the arctic and encouraged inuit to settle nearby to help establish canadian sovereignty in a small group of inuit from northern quebec were urged to move to resolute government officials told them the climate was similar and there was plenty of wildlife said allie salluviniq who moved with his family here when he was years old and learned of the events from relatives "they lied to us " says mr salluviniq who is now married to the mayor of resolute "we were just human flagpoles for them " mr salluviniq made the same complaint to mr harper when the prime minister visited resolute this summer the harper government wouldnt comment on the matter mr salluviniq said people nearly starved to death the first winter they moved to resolute in other aboriginal communities children were taken away from their families and educated in residential schools that discouraged their culture and their native language a settlement of c&# billion dollars has been reached with the government in response to their mistreatment in the territory of nunavut which encompasses nearly one fifth of canada was carved out of the northwest territories in return for hunting and fishing rights and financial support the inuit agreed to give up claims of some land to the federal government but eight years later the federal government hasnt lived up to its end of the bargain says ms simon "there is still a lot of bitterness toward the government here " mayor susan salluviniq says "its passed down from generation to generation " about people live in the canadian arctic out of the million people in canada in nunavuts sweeping landscape there is just one highway running for only miles and a single deep water port in nanisivik which is to be upgraded by the military perhaps the biggest infrastructure deficit is that most of the airstrips that serve the territory are outdated limiting competition and keeping the cost of air travel as well as many basic items high says john hawkins a director of transportation and planning in the nunavut government recently in resolute the local co op was charging c&# for a can of pepsi cigarettes were c&# and a can of ravioli was c&# jim prentice who just completed an month stint as the minister of indian and northern affairs and is now minister of industry says the military investment will create jobs as will the burgeoning energy and mineral sector "our job right now is to make sure young people have the education to take part in the economic opportunities that will be coming" to the far north says mr prentice "i think we have struck the right balance "
