charting the agony of a brain as it struggles to be fair at the canaan childrens home in southern uganda the orphans had no idea that a woman inside a brain scanner miles away was playing mind games with their food the children were the focus of a brain experiment under way at the california institute of technology to explore the neural anatomy of indecision with the push of a button the woman in the caltech scanner could distribute meals at the orphanage more fairly but only by taking food off the table not by serving more portions while she pondered the ton fmri scanner at the universitys brain imaging center traced the synaptic patterns of equity remorse and reward in her brain in these riptides of neural currents the researchers sought clues to human variables missing from the mathematics of conventional economics the quirky experiment exemplifies the new field of neuroeconomics behavioral economist ming hsu and his caltech colleagues combined financial decision theories and medical brain imaging tools to analyze the brain as a living engine of economics one fine tuned by evolution through eons of foraging for scarce resources these scientists studied hard choices documenting how competing networks of neurons unconsciously shape the way we buy sell risk and trust during this test the scientists wanted to see how synapses valued fairness against the desire to avoid harming others the dilemma can arise when a limited resource is distributed unequally and the only way to help one person comes at anothers expense whether in profit sharing setting affirmative action policy or rationing health care in the summer of when they organized the test dr hsu and his colleagues could imagine no more agonizing choice within the constraints of medical ethics than to ask people to take food away from orphans in a war torn african country an online search led them to the web site for the canaan childrens home a one story green building with a clinic next door set amid the trees and chicken coops a half hours drive from jinja uganda as of april children were living there many of them orphaned by aids said frank p crane in richmond va chairman of the uganda missions action committee which monitors the homes finances it was the winsome faces of those children whose photographs had been posted on the web site to solicit charitable donations that caught dr hsus science eye here was the perfect experimental device for stirring the turmoil of indecision the researchers agreed the team next contacted tom roberts an attorney in richmond who created the web site he gave consent for the photos to be used because there would be no contact with the children and no actual consequences of the experiment to the orphanage "i said help yourself " mr roberts recalled dr hsu wanted the pictures to heighten the realism of the experiment in the scanner each volunteer could equalize how a fixed amount of donated meals was shared between orphans but only by taking away meals from those who had more than others and thereby reducing the total number of meals given to the orphanage the allocation of meals was sometimes fair sometimes not "we manipulated the allocations and how much could be taken away " dr hsu said to trigger the brain behavior the volunteers had to believe their decisions really would affect orphans being denied their seat at a groaning board of plenty where others feasted so the experimenters made them all study a page brochure with pictures of orphans in rounds of testing each subject had seconds to choose the lesser of two evils allow some children to keep more than their fair share of meals or take away their food to eliminate inequity it was a measure of the economics of morality dr hsu made the inequities more or less severe by changing the number of meals donated to different groups of children that provoked patterns of neural activation that revealed the brains distaste for injustice and its willingness if the disparity was wide enough in one case one child receiving five times more than another to punish the rich by putting them on short rations to redress the extremes people were willing to confiscate meals even when it hurt the orphanage as a whole dr hsu now at the university of illinois reported recently at a meeting of the society for neuroeconomics in nantasket mass as a test of economic theory against the benchmark of the brain the uganda experiment is one subtle brushstroke in an emerging self portrait of the mind generated by floods of new brain data indeed neuroeconomics itself is still so new that cultural anthropologists from the massachusetts institute of technology and new york university are documenting the folkways of this nascent network of scholars "the payout for this in economics may not come for years " said university of zurich economist ernst fehr "economics is a slow science " email me at sciencejournal wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to the science journal forum
