weekend journal taste fames fortune new york the hall of fame for great americans sits on a bluff in the bronx overlooking the harlem river a sweeping foot open air colonnade designed by stanford white on what is now the campus of bronx community college the hall enshrines great americans though the last bronze busts were added in when franklin delano roosevelt was voted in the hall of fames story tells much about america something about the changing fortunes of the bronx and a lot about fame america boasts at least halls of fame and the total count could easily be twice that most halls confine themselves to proclaiming the famous in a particular activity the national mining hall of fame &amp museum in leadville colo or the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown n y for example others catalog fame according to geography as in the south dakota hall of fame some like the georgia sports hall of fame and the alabama jazz hall of fame in birmingham ala do both sports and music halls have a built in fan base but the hall of fame for great americans filled with presidents authors and engineers has faded into obscurity the bronx hall was conceived in by henry mitchell maccracken chancellor of new york university and by white who had been commissioned to design a library for nyus bronx campus the lavish library reminiscent of the pantheon in rome not to mention columbia universitys low memorial library built around the same time by whites partner and rival charles mckim needed a retaining wall but rather than settle for a wall white decided to build a sweeping arc around the building and turn it into americas first hall of fame according to art zuckerman who serves as its curator the halls bylaws provided that elections would be held every five years starting in and that no one would be eligible who had not been dead for years the electors who in included john dos passos herbert hoover and reinhold niehbuhr were themselves luminaries jay oliva a former president of nyu says the hall was in part "a hype job" by mr maccracken to draw attention to nyus campus in what was then the countryside but it was also "an american idea " mr oliva says born from the gilded age notion that america was emerging as a great power and that its history should be carefully recorded and celebrated elections to the hall became "a huge deal " mr oliva says and the bronx building became famous itself the new york times dutifully reported its elections and even its nominations which came from the public senators and supreme court justices spoke at the unveilings soon the term "hall of fame" entered the lexicon when dorothys house lands on the wicked witch in "the wizard of oz" the munchkins serenade dorothy "from now on youll be history you will be a bust in the hall of fame " the munchkins werent singing about cooperstown where the baseball folks opened their hall in the same year the movie was released the bronx hall is a window on early th century ideas of greatness the class of for instance contains some obvious entrants like george washington eli whitney and ben franklin but there are a few less remembered figures like asa gray a botanist and william ellery channing a unitarian preacher the hall contains sections devoted to statesmen inventors and authors there is also a section for teachers but there are just two actors edwin booth and charlotte saunders cushman and three composers stephen foster john philip sousa and edward a macdowell now the hall despite its history and its glorious architecture sits unloved and scarcely visited in part this is because nyu sold the campus to the city and left the borough but a larger reason is that ideals of fame current in the early th century have slipped from favor the belief in transcendent glory is "a very roman idea " says leo braudy a professor at the university of southern california and author of "the frenzy of renown fame and its history " the people who made it into the hall shaped history like roman generals and emperors and were thought worthy of preservation in bronze today the "great man" theory of history is itself archaic and "fame can be google hits " as mr braudy says modern americans seem much less willing to proclaim greatness in an all encompassing sense its easier to do so in a specialized field mr braudy notes and many of todays halls of fame are devoted to niche talents such as stock car racing the rodeo or softball apart from the urge to build tourist attractions which certainly plays a part the volume of halls of fame today stems from our cultures urge for self congratulation the idea that everyone should get a prize for something mr braudy says selecting individuals for glory can be at least partly political and that also makes todays americans uncomfortable there is less consensus now than in mr maccrackens time for these sorts of choices even back in the day there was a lot of lobbying for stonewall jackson who made it and for jefferson davis who did not mr oliva the former nyu president says after when fdr and george washington carver were elected and when nyu decamped from the bronx the hall stopped admitting new members the money dried up mr zuckerman who heads an organization called friends of the hall of fame is trying to revive interest and begin elections anew but in our warholian age who would make the cut martin luther king and albert einstein would be shoo ins but would electors have to give a nod to sports adding babe ruth and joe louis could they not acknowledge pop culture adding elvis cole porter and louis armstrong if armstrong is in what about jimi hendrix or jim morrison and if you start admitting movie stars where do you stop if dorothy is in can judy garland be denied mr ackman
