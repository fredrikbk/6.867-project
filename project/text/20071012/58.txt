legal grounds plaintiffs suing u s tribes cant get their day in court hit with lawsuits indian owned casinos can claim immunity the collision jolted gary filer awake in the back seat a second impact brought his minivan crashing to a halt against a highway barrier mr filer lay partially on the road his legs trapped in the wreckage listening to the whine of his dog sadie "she worked her way out and crawled over and lay on my lap " he remembers the minivan driven by mr filers wife had been hit by a cadillac escalade traveling the wrong way down arizonas interstate the driver had been drinking heavily at a tribal casino six miles away the impact killed mr filers wife the lower portion of mr filers right leg was later amputated sadie was euthanized the wrecks legal consequences seemed clear douglas levitski the escalade driver had a blood alcohol level nearly three times the arizona limit when he slammed into the filers grand voyager just after midnight on july he was later charged with second degree murder the casino where he was drinking seemed a good target for a lawsuit like many states arizona has a law that makes liable establishments and employees that serve alcohol to visibly intoxicated customers who then cause accidents but when mr filer went to sue the casino in state court in tucson he quickly learned that the textbook on civil litigation doesnt apply on tribal land or to tribal entities under federal law tribes are considered sovereign nations and are immune from most lawsuits the desert diamond casino where the driver douglas levitski got drunk is on the san miguel reservation of the tohono oodham nation so even though the accident itself involved no tribal members and took place off the reservation mr filers state civil suit seeking &# million in damages from the tribal owned casino was rejected arizonas appeals court upheld the decision "this conclusion we hasten to add may be unsatisfactory to some and arguably divorced from the realities of the modern world " wrote judge john pelander in the opinion mr filer moved his claim to tribal court and is waiting for a hearing but he and his lawyer are nervous about the outcome even though their case appears to be strong more than a centurys worth of conflicting federal laws and judicial precedents have left the tribal legal system in tatters tribal authorities pursuing criminal cases face tough restrictions have little say in meting out sentences and have virtually no authority in prosecuting non indians who commit crimes on reservations in civil matters it is the tribes that are in control many tribes claim some form of sovereign immunity meaning they cant be sued in state federal or tribal court even when tribes waive these rights as those with significant commercial interests typically do litigants are funneled into the tribal justice system of the nations federally recognized tribes only have court systems if the case can even be heard tribes often sharply limit potential damages and tribes often have close links to businesses that might be sued especially casinos such connections would be considered a conflict of interest in a regular u s court "you try the case in front of a judge who is picked by the tribe " says stephen embry a connecticut attorney and past president of the workers injury and law advocacy group "what you normally would like to have is a judge who is not being paid by the guy youre suing " he says federal and state judges who hear cases against the government are also government employees but the conflicts tend to be less glaring than in the small tribal communities all these matters have grown more urgent and complicated as tribes have developed highly lucrative casino industries that draw thousands of non indians daily as patrons and employees from to the number of gaming facilities grew from to and revenues roughly tripled to more than &# billion currently there are about gaming facilities defenders of indian civil law say that the system is not much different than the approach taken by federal government and u s states which in many instances claim immunity from litigation and also cap damages awards sovereign immunity is "a perennial issue in indian country " says gabriel galanda a seattle attorney expert on indian law and a member of the round valley indian confederation in california but he says it is "inaccurate to say there is no due process to resolve claims" because many tribal court systems are sophisticated the immunity from lawsuits that native american tribes enjoy is connected to their status as sovereign governments a recognition that was upheld in an supreme court decision that called them "domestic dependent nations " over the years courts have recognized and upheld the principle even while questioning its wisdom the doctrine might have been necessary to protect "nascent" tribal authorities wrote supreme court justice anthony kennedy in a opinion but immunity has extended "beyond what is needed to safeguard tribal self governance " he added "tribal enterprises now include ski resorts gambling and sales of cigarettes to non indians in this economic context immunity can harm those who are unaware they are dealing with a tribe who do not know of tribal immunity or who have no choice in the matter " the court stopped short of ending the concept and left it to congress to make revisions which it hasnt done angela mccor tried to sue a tribe in claiming her foot was injured by a falling bar stool at the hard rock casino on the small seminole reservation in tampa fla says her attorney jack gordon a lower state court judge ruled in her favor but a state appellate court overturned that decision noting that the tribe had not given ms mccor permission to sue in state court "it is adjacent to the state fairgrounds and advertises itself as a hotel and casino on orient road in tampa florida but this casino is not legally in florida " wrote state appellate judge c j altenbernd in the ruling "the average tourist has no idea that her constitutional rights to access to the courts and to trial by jury do not apply to any claims that may arise while she visits the hotel and casino " mr gordon her attorney says he didnt consider going to tribal court which he says was effectively run by the same people who had fought the claim up until that point gary bitner a tribe spokesman said he could not talk about the specific case but added that the tribe is concerned that patrons feel at ease on the properties and know that they will be compensated if accidents occur "as a result of that they maintain an insurance policy for accidents that are legitimate that has compensated a number of people over the past few years " he said "cases that are not resolved are very rare now " in april nellie lawrence had just arrived at the barona tribe valley ranch resort in lakeside calif when someone running through the casino slammed into her knocking her to the floor her shoulder was shattered she stayed in the hospital days "i was terrified id end up in a nursing home " she says the tribes insurance company rejected her claim for &# million meaning she would have to try to win damages in court in signing a compact with the state to operate its casino the tribe waived its immunity from lawsuits but it didnt give permission to be sued in state courts when mrs lawrence tried to bring the matter to the tribes court however she learned the tribe didnt have one neither for civil nor criminal proceedings instead its bylaws allowed it to name a body to handle justice issues when mrs lawrence and her husband arrived for the hearing she faced a jury made up of five tribal council members who are among those who ultimately oversee the casino operation the presiding judge was the tribes defense attorney the same woman who has fought mrs lawrences appeals in state court the tribe didnt return calls seeking comment having lost in tribal court mrs lawrence turned back to state courts hoping to win reimbursement for her tens of thousands of dollars in medical expenses local district court ruled it had no jurisdiction and the state appeals court agreed ms kane has filed another appeal this time with the florida supreme court unless it rules in mrs lawrences favor the original tribal court opinion is "unappealable " says bonnie kane who is representing mrs lawrence "its an issue of our most basic rights " three years after losing his leg in the car wreck mr filer has regained much of his mobility thin and fit he plays golf and softball and he rides a mountain bike although "clearly i dont have the running speed i used to " his prosthetic leg can be painful which recently forced him to take it off for a month pictures stored on his cellphone represent a timeline of the recent past the first picture was taken april it is easter sunday and he is with his wife barbara linehan and their teenage daughters alexandra and lenahan it is the quartets last picture together the next is from more than a year later the young women are standing next to the roadside memorial they erected at the scene where their mother died "she was my soul mate " mr filer says the two met while working at an information data company in fort worth one evening early in their relationship a thief put a pistol in mr filers face and robbed the couple "she used to say i sure knew how to show a girl a good time " he says laughing they married and moved to san diego their final drive together was one theyd made dozens of times miles from san diego to texas to see ms linehans mother and other family and friends mr filer drove first when his wife took over mr filer says he kissed her told her he loved her and climbed into the back seat of the van sadie the familys year old labrador rhodesian ridgeback mix had claimed the middle row initially he slept with his head toward the drivers side after a gas stop he switched to the passenger side and drifted back to sleep then he was woken by the impact "i could feel the car still moving " he says "i remember hoping she hadnt fallen asleep " the van came to rest facing the wrong way its side sheared off medical personnel were there in minutes and cut mr filer from the wreckage no one answered when he asked about his wife in the ambulance he heard someone say "she didnt make it " he woke up a week later in the hospital where his brother told him what happened ms linehan was dead the escalade had narrowly missed two other cars before hitting the san diego couple although mr filer says his faith and grief counseling helped him "come out the other end of it " his wifes death devastated the family the next shock was when he tried to sue the casino the driver faced criminal charges and ultimately was sentenced to years for manslaughter and aggravated assault but mr filers attorney figured the casino was potentially liable for civil damages for allowing the driver to drink to beyond the point of intoxication and for having a valet bring him his car arizona has strict "dram shop" laws which are named for liquor stores in th century england and are on the books in about states mr filers attorney donald diamond says he didnt think twice about filing the suit in state court no one involved in the accident was a tribal member and the crash didnt take place on a reservation he says "the only tribal connection was the casino served the drunk driver a lot of alcohol " the court rejected his suit saying it had no jurisdiction the arizona court of appeals agreed and the state supreme court declined the case now mr filer is waiting for a court date he says he thinks about the small miracles if he hadnt switched the direction he was sleeping he likely would have been decapitated there was an emergency team nearby to rescue him and his younger daughter alexandra decided to stay behind and fly to the family reunion with her sister rather than travel with her parents in the van the tribe has a robust justice system a modern courthouse and a division that handles only civil cases it also has an appeals court tribal attorneys say they cant comment because the case is pending mr filers attorney mr diamond says he isnt sure what to expect at the tribal court level "we havent yet seen our day in court so i cant speak on first hand experience on how things will turn out all were looking for is a level playing field were not saying you cant get a level playing field there but what if you dont "
