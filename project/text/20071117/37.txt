farther afield africa overall is emerging as a hot destination for money amid a global commodities boom investment bankers from around the world are flocking to african commercial hubs such as lagos nigeria and johannesburg china in particular is pouring cash into the continent investing in oil fields mines and more recently the financial sector just last month industrial &amp commercial bank of china ltd said it would spend &# billion for a stake in south africas standard bank managers at imara holdings ltd a botswana based investment banking company were surprised when investors started asking this year about zimbabwe considering the seemingly better opportunities in the region including diamond rich botswana and agribusiness focused uganda dave eliot chief executive of subsidiary imara assets management in south africa said he once classified zimbabwe as an "emerging market " but has now downgraded it to "frontier" status since the country began falling apart in the past few years "its gone backwards " he says once known as rhodesia under white minority rule zimbabwe became a democracy in after a prolonged guerrilla war the veteran guerrilla leader mr mugabe was elected president and the new country became the darling of foreign investors eager to access zimbabwes natural resources within a decade mr mugabe had become corrupt and paranoid fixing elections crushing

platinum reserves in the world as a result natural resource investors who are used to operating amid political instability are looking closely at zimbabwe too south africa based impala platinum holdings ltd which owns two zimbabwean mining subsidiaries has announced plans to expand its operations in the country and anglo platinum ltd is planning to build a ton a month mine one of its larger projects despite the excitement zimbabwe is still one of the worlds riskiest bets lawmakers recently took steps to tighten foreign ownership rules requiring local ownership of foreign companies there

overrun the nations commercial farms owned mostly by white zimbabweans throwing food production into disarray part of the challenge of investing in zimbabwe is figuring out how much anything is actually worth given the plummeting zimbabwean dollar the reserve bank of zimbabwe fixes the exchange rate at zimbabwean dollars to the u s dollar the problem zimbabweans dont put much faith in that figure if they did theyd quickly lose all their money there is another presumably more accurate method of estimating what a zim dollar is worth dubbed the "old mutual implied rate " it offers a glimpse of the obstacles to doing business in zimbabwe it is based on the share price of old mutual a british investment company whose stock trades on three different markets london johannesburg and zimbabwes capital of harare because all old mutual shares are of equal value it is possible to extrapolate the market value of the zim dollar by comparing the price of old mutual shares on the different markets on friday the old mutual implied rate stood at zimbabwean dollars to the u s dollar not everyone can stomach that much risk navaid burney managing director of washington based private equity firm emerging capital partners which invests exclusively in africa says his fund hasnt made a move in zimbabwe yet "it doesnt have the feel of lagos " he says referring to the crumbling crime plagued nigerian commercial hub which is a bustling boomtown by comparison
