tax rates influence both yield and fairness stephen moore in his article "the supply side solution " nov points out how many of the newly democratic countries such as estonia and astonishingly many of the very old countries such as ireland germany and others are moving to flat and lower rate taxes the critics of the effects of lowering taxes cannot be honest or perhaps do not understand arithmetic in capitalist countries where the economic activity is created by the private sector there are two taxation points for which tax revenues are easy to compute at a tax rate of there are no taxes collected at tax rates of there will be taxes collected for only a very short time and then the amount will also fall to none the only question then is what happens between these two extremes while the exact shape of laffers curve might be questioned the general form seems unassailable perhaps the writers of the publications mentioned in mr moores article cannot grasp the obviousness of this or perhaps they are trying to accomplish something else namely redistributionism bruce greer hillsboro ore of course higher taxes dampen incentives and growth no one with any basic understanding of economics could deny that fact the question is whether tax cuts have the overwhelming curative effect on the economy that supply siders claim whether those tax cuts by themselves actually lead to an expansion in tax revenues and dont shortchange other national priorities and importantly whether those tax cuts are equitable to all segments of society mr moores spurious defense of supply side theory doesnt really address these crucial details in addition if as mr moore concedes tax cuts arent the only thing that matter in an economic expansion then its certainly possible that they often barely matter at all there is without a doubt more evidence supporting theories of global warming than there is supporting the outrageous claims of supply side proponents like mr moore frank z riely jr floyds knobs ind stephen moore makes the case for low marginal tax rates based on empirical results lowered taxes have increased revenues lower marginal rates have resulted in the top of the income pyramid paying an increased proportion of the overall tax income tax cuts have resulted in a surge of economic growth the accepted rationale for these results is that lower marginal tax rates increase incentives for investing saving and work while this is obvious i suggest that there is another negative mechanism at work which is even more important high marginal tax rates generate great incentives at the top of the income pyramid to find ways to avoid punitive taxes these incentives cause no end of mischief lawyers accountants and lobbyists are paid large fees to create loopholes so that the punitive taxes can be avoided businesses direct their investment and operations to minimize taxes wall street focuses on tax avoidance rather than responsible investment even middle class individuals make ill advised investments or expenditures to obtain tax benefits as demonstrated by the current mortgage crisis legislators and the intellectual elite have learned over the past years that the tax code is the perfect vehicle to encourage their preferred behaviors through "tax incentives " that is to leverage the power of the state they have learned that tax legislation is the easiest way to favor special interests and campaign contributors as a result we have a tax code of mind numbing complexity where it is easy to hide "goodies" for special interests since the tax code is subject to change each legislative session there is no long term certainty upon which to base economic decisions it is a wonder that the economy works at all high marginal tax rates a complex tax code and meddling legislature are a huge drag on the economy we need to remove the negative incentives by completely overhauling the tax code james a ferner battle ground wash
