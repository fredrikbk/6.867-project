regular raises and promotions much more than any of their parents earned and double the annual average salary in india at pantaloon they were brushing up against a lifestyle they hope to be fully part of some day equipped with new cellphones the three men took to speaking to one other in english a language they rarely used before they also absorbed the latest bollywood fashion trends buying knock off designer jeans from street markets rather than paying pantaloons prices of &# to &# a pair on weekends after work they would hang outside dance clubs anxious to see the clubbers outfits "i will spend money like them someday " said mr bhatade such basic sales jobs unremarkable and often derided in the west are providing careers confidence and a shot at entering the consumer class to millions of impoverished young men and women across india as their ranks swell these children of slum dwellers servants sweepers and others low on the socioeconomic totem pole are forming a new stratum of workers they are likely to play an important role in determining the future of the worlds second most populous nation until recently much of the new wealth in india went to college educated computer programmers consultants and call center workers while they have made the countrys technology industry a new pillar of global commerce the total number employed by the software industry is still only about two million less than of indias billion population at the other end of the spectrum india still has more than million people who live below the poverty line mostly farmers between the two are tens of millions of indians mostly city dwellers in their s and s who are taking their first steps into the salaried class by selling goods and services to the increasingly free spending upper crust they represent a kind of swing vote in how far india can spread the fruits of its rapid expansion annual economic growth has averaged more than for the past four years but much of the benefits have accrued to the old industrial families and the tech savvy few in the past less educated urbanites had few options beyond seeking a government job often through family connections or bribes they would go abroad or work for wealthy families who refer to them as "delivery boys " "tea boys" and "peons " in contrast to china where wealth spread as rural labor moved from farming to manufacturing indias growth is being led by a sharp rise in domestic consumption stronger spending power is opening up opportunities concentrated in service sectors like retailing banking and hospitality and telecommunications firm data are hard to come by but available statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest an explosion in service jobs the unemployment rate for male high school graduates in the cities for example fell from in to in according to government statistics over the next three years says the images group a research and consulting group in india the retail sector will create more than million new jobs in the country indias reliance industries ltd says it will hire close to people to staff its new chain of supermarkets pantaloon retail ltd indias largest retailer with annual sales of around &# billion hires more than people a month "people are not despondent anymore " says n s sastry former director of the national sample survey organization the government office that tracks employment trends "they see better employment opportunities better earning capacities and opportunities to improve their skills " in the brightly lit white walled pantaloon jeans department the seven foot high shelves are filled with denim from international brands like lee and pepe it could be any middling u s department store except for the hindi pop music videos playing on huge television screens and the photos of bollywood stars promoting the brands still it was a completely foreign environment when the three young men first arrived several years ago "they are absolutely raw when they come in " says mansur khan the year old who trained all the departments employees after working for pantaloon for seven years he teaches new recruits about confidence sales fashion and even hygiene "they come from an altogether different background " mr shaikh a lanky year old with wiry hair grew up in the slums nearby his father died when he was ten forcing his mother to work different jobs to raise her two sons after sending them off to school in the morning she made plastic buckets and cut thread for shirts in small neighborhood factories she didnt always make enough to feed her children the only open space for the boys to play was a nearby graveyard they stumbled over tombstones during games of cricket along with his mother and brother mr shaikh today shares a square foot home on a dark alley in a muslim ghetto it has a bed a tiny kitchen and a pile of suitcases for the moves his family makes almost every year after high school mr shaikh had put aside his interest in college to find a job "once you start looking for money you stop thinking about education " he worked for a while in a small doctors clinic handing out prescriptions the elevator operators job he recalls was the worst so four years ago when phoenix mills opened part of a massive urban development project he applied at pantaloon without even knowing what it was mr gundetis family is from the southern state of andhra pradesh but he grew up in mumbai where his father worked in a textile factory until his job was eliminated almost all of the &# severance he received went toward treating his wifes stomach cancer the family also sold its slum home to help pay for the treatment still mrs gundeti died last august the elder mr gundeti now sweeps floors at a nearby television studio he had great hopes for rakesh whom he named after the first indian in space rakesh sharma who was part of a soviet mission in but hes turned cautious about what he expects from life "every time we have a little hope something bad happens " the father said as he brushed aside ants on the floor of his small corrugated steel home rakesh years old and a big fan of american pro wrestling had a friend who worked at pantaloon so he applied too mr bhatade grew up in a small town about miles north of mumbai for the past years his father has manned a machine that makes brown paper bags the family lives in a square foot hut built against the wall of the factory when mr bhatade was a boy he planted marigolds and a pomegranate tree outside their door and adopted neighborhood street cats to make the modest abode feel like a home his parents insisted on a basic education "we didnt want them to suffer like we did " says his mother vanita bhatade years old his first job after high school was at a garment factory where he worked for more than a year mr bhatades father told him to look for work in mumbai so he moved in with his uncle in a city slum after a stint peddling credit cards door to door a friend tipped him off that pantaloon was hiring he went for an interview in may of and got the job immediately mr bhatade found the clientele to be a big challenge it was the first time any of the young men had talked to people much richer than themselves "when i came i was very shy " mr bhatade recalls "i would watch them from afar i couldnt even ask them what they were looking for " the young men were often yelled at or accused of falling down on the job as skeptical customers refused to believe their size was out of stock or got irate if the clothes they wanted didnt fit theyd shout "who is handling this section " mr bhatade recalls "who is the boss who is the store manager who is the department manager " mr bhatade would offer a simple "i am sorry " as the longest serving pantaloon employee of the three mr shaikh became the unofficial assistant manager of the department often staying late into the night to make sure his shelves and racks looked clean "i never used to fold my clothes at home " he said with a grin for jeans advice he turned to mr bhatade the departments resident expert on more than types of jeans and denim he can describe the difference between "monkey wash" and "tiger wash" to his english speaking customers in monkey wash the front of the pants is faded in tiger wash the fading is in horizontal stripes and for light relief to break up the day theyd pick on mr gundeti the department comic making fun of his "funny" southern indian accent when hed return late from a tea break or ask to go home early his colleagues insisted that he must have had a date the razzing often sent mr gundeti into a faux fit of anger making everyone laugh when not with customers the three men would chat constantly about sales targets cricket family and movies the managers discouraged them from bunching together on the floor so they tried to stay at least five feet from each other as they folded pair after pair of jeans one recent afternoon mr bhatade and mr shaikh debated how their section compared to others in the store formal mens wear has the highest sales every month so employees there have a greater shot at sales based bonuses but denim is better than working in the womens wear departments they agreed because female customers are much more demanding "they will try on each color in their size and still they are never happy " said mr shaikh laughing "is your girlfriend like that " he asked mr bhatade blushing mr bhatade walked away their outside interests and social lives increasingly tilted toward pantaloon and away from the slums "i try to teach my friends to end their vulgar language and behavior " said mr gundeti of his neighborhood friends "they dont change so i dont spend time with some of them anymore " instead the men watch movies together or with other acquaintances from pantaloon restaurant dinners are still beyond their reach but on birthdays they pitch in for a cake and take it to the beach to eat on a company team building outing they slid down water slides at a resort near mumbai it was the first time mr bhatade had been in a swimming pool "most of my free time i spend with my pantaloon friends " he said the store doubled as a place of worship for a few weeks in september a room near the denim department housed a statue of the elephant headed hindu god ganesha that was decorated with streamers and flowers and lit with a purple spotlight mr gundeti went daily to give offerings and sing religious songs mr bhatade and other pantaloon employees later carried the idol to the ocean and left it in the arabian sea the traditional end to the ganesha festival during ramadan the muslim holy month mr shaikh and his supervisor mr khan joined the stores other muslim employees on the roof of the store to break their fast at dusk rather than going to nearby mosques each night they kneeled among piles of boxes full of clothes to pray and passed dates and slices of watermelon as the sun set over the new mall being built next door while pantaloon isnt a quick route out of the slums the jobs and the pay offered something else the occasional luxury some financial reassurance and a large dose of self esteem mr shaikh used to wear irregular pieces from the factory where his mother worked shirts where the pockets didnt match for example his store job allowed him to purchase his first "branded" pair of jeans on sale for &# in september he bought a computer picking one that can also be used as a television so his mother can watch soap operas some regular customers started asking him for his fashion advice "people are going for the comfort fit not the boot cut " he said mr gundeti has supported his father with his pantaloon salary and taken advantage of its afternoon shifts to study computer programming in the mornings he just bought a laptop it cost more than a desk top but his home has no desk his family has noticed that he isnt as hot tempered as he used to be and that he is more "gentlemanly " his hindi is now peppered with english phrases like "you know " and "i mean " over the next six years he hopes to boost his salary significantly enough to buy an apartment for his father mr bhatade too has matured since he started working at the store according to his parents and sisters while he used to be shy and withdrawn he recently planned his sisters wedding a huge undertaking in even the poorest indian homes he says he is embarrassed by the clothes he used to wear and today tries to teach his friends and his sisters about mumbai style meanwhile he has become one of the most eligible bachelors in his community says his father who has turned down more than five offers of arranged marriage for his son already over the past month each team member has taken new steps up in the direction of the consumer class mr gundeti earned a promotion to cashier in pantaloons jeans department mr shaikh left his job to start his own small business recruiting people to work on construction projects across the middle east mr bhatade was promoted to "team leader " which means he will manage a group similar to his old gang in the denim department but on a different floor it is now his turn to teach the job to a new batch of hires from the slums
