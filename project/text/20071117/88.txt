weekend journal sports &amp recreation gearing up is yoga just posing as a good workout while practitioners say the ancient art is good cardiovascular exercise most fitness experts say thats a stretch how to find a balanced routine ask bikram choudhury founder of the bikram style of yoga if yoga alone is enough of a cardiovascular workout and he will laugh in your face "my classes are so hard you use your heart more than if you run a marathon " ask kenneth h cooper the physician credited with coining the term "aerobics" and founding the aerobics movement back in the s and he says that while some types of classes can provide good exercise yoga should be supplemented with at least minutes of sustained rhythmic cardiovascular training three times a week "dont make the mistake of only doing yoga " he warns so who is right almost every study on yoga and fitness agrees that the practice has a significant positive impact on muscular strength endurance and flexibility but most find doing only yoga without mixing in some traditional aerobic workouts doesnt exercise the heart enough thats a growing concern with more than million americans practicing yoga and tai chi now up from six million in according to the sporting goods manufacturers association cardiovascular exercise defined as a repetitive rhythmical exercise involving large muscle groups is widely viewed as increasing longevity by increasing the bodys demand for oxygen and making the heart and lungs work harder according to the american college of sports medicine it should involve pushing your heart rate to to of its maximum and keeping it there for to minutes at a time seeing a horror movie can elevate the heart rate so a faster rate isnt proof of cardio conditioning to see how efficiently the muscles are using oxygen it is necessary to use a test tube like mask over the mouth of the person exercising to find how much oxygen is consumed the term used to measure cardio respiratory fitness is vo or the maximum oxygen used by the body there havent been many published peer reviewed studies of the cardiovascular effects of yoga a duke university study in the journal of gerontology found that those who participated in four months of aerobic exercise training produced an overall improvement in peak vo in contrast those who did the same amount of yoga experienced no change in cardio respiratory fitness co author and duke psychologist james blumenthal says the yoga consisted mostly of stretching and stationary positions this was backed up by a study in the journal of strength and conditioning research in that looked at "hatha" yoga a term that includes a variety of yoga styles in this study it included "movements that are implemented in typical hatha yoga classes found in health clubs fitness centers and studios " according to one of the authors the results showed an expenditure of oxygen about twice as high as resting but almost half as high as walking "thats the same amount youd expend scratching yourself " says christopher dunbar director of the laboratory of applied physiology at brooklyn college of the city university of new york "you can be sweating and your heart can be beating fast but that still doesnt mean you are getting an effective cardiovascular workout " says cedric bryant chief science officer for the american council on exercise which funded a study that found no significant increase in cardiovascular health from yoga in contrast a study published in preventive cardiology in and conducted by researchers at the university of california at davis looked at college students who attended four sessions a week minutes of pranayama breathing exercises minutes of warm ups minutes of asanas or poses and minutes of meditation the students had an increase in "vomax" the amount of oxygen consumed at the persons highest level of activity of indicating a respectable level of aerobic activity the yoga practiced in the study was a combination of different types of hatha and the warm up exercises were mostly stretching which wouldnt affect the vomax says uc davis cardiovascular medicine professor ezra a amsterdam it isnt hard to find anecdotal evidence that yoga helps people lose weight and feel fit honolulu attorney jennifer lyons who typically does minutes of bikram yoga a day says her practice has given her a sufficient foundation to swim a mile or to run or bike several miles with relative ease over the past few months in her studio shes watched one woman go from more than pounds and unable to do much more than to stay in the hot room to moving down five dress sizes and being able to do about two thirds of the postures mr choudhury says modern medical science isnt developed enough to explain yogas benefits but he sees practical evidence every day lewis g maharam a sports medicine doctor and medical director of the new york road runners says measuring cardiovascular activity in yoga is tricky as it varies depending on the instructor the type of yoga and the individuals fitness level but dr maharam says no yoga provides the rhythmic aerobic exercise that is always beneficial one that keeps the heart rate in the right range for at least a continuous minutes there have long been funny yoga spinoffs like laughter yoga and sleep yoga now to address the yoga cardio dilemma theres a bevy of so called fusion yoga classes yoga spinning combines indoor cycling with hatha stretches yoga booty ballet marries yoga with dance and ariel yoga involves a trapeze purists say these offshoots arent really yoga they compromise the traditional disciplined technique of the poses compromising poses and pushing participants to go for the burn and the intensity can also increase the risk of injury over the past three years americans were treated in an emergency room or a doctors office for yoga related injuries according to the consumer product safety commission beth shaw founder of yoga fit in torrance calif teaches classes that combine aerobic exercises with yoga poses such as squats rowing chair pose and jumping forward with a ball between the legs she believes the workouts provide at least minutes of sustained cardiovascular activity however she still tells students to get an additional minutes running brisk walking at least three times a week "yoga should be a supplement " she says dr cooper recommends people do all three exercises cardiovascular musculoskeletal and relaxation stress reduction he suggests people in their s do aerobic musculoskeletal that moves to for people in their s for those in their s and for those and older muscles start to atrophy when you age unless you exercise to keep muscle mass that means at least minutes of continuous cardiovascular exercise three times a week and to minutes of musculoskeletal twice a week yoga he says falls into the musculoskeletal and relaxation categories do you think yoga is a good workout tell us at wsj com onlinetoday finding the right
