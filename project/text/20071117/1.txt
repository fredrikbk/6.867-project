a frank exchange of views on the farm bill the editorial of nov "the no farmer left behind act " goes beyond a lack of understanding of how this nations farm economy works the journal shows a purposeful disregard for rural families whose livelihoods depend on the five year farm bill now before congress in the space of this letter i hope to help your readers sort out the contortions of logic and distortions of fact on which your editorial lies first the farm bill weve written in the senate costs less than what was proposed by the white house you read that correctly the white house plan costs more and adds to the nations debt by contrast our plan costs less than the administrations and is completely paid for second the journal grossly misstates the commodity support we give our farmers commodity support will consume one quarter of of the federal budget under the bill now before congress that is hardly onerous when the goal is to have a safe affordable and abundant food supply grown here within our borders perhaps the journal would prefer we become dependent on foreign nations for our food just as we are with oil finally the journal glosses over the impact that high oil prices and other non farm input costs have on the cost of groceries consumer food prices have increased about since but the farmer share of retail food costs have risen by less that its a fact that many more acres are devoted to corn as our farmers try to break our nations dependence on foreign supplies of oil but it is also a fact that high oil prices about double what they were a year ago have a great impact on family grocery bills the journals shabby treatment of the farm bill unfortunately only reflects the elitist attitude of some in our nations media our nations rural families deserve better your readers deserve editorials based on fact logic and reality sen kent conrad d n d bismarck n d your editorial stated that food prices are rising faster than at anytime in years thanks in part to the outdated u s farm program but pound for pound sugar is among the most highly subsidized of all crops the subsidies work differently import quotas and minimum price guarantees rather than income support payments but they are subsidies all the same while the cost to consumers and taxpayers is soaring it threatens to go even higher if congress fails to reform the sugar program this year american consumers will continue to pay the price not only at tax time but whenever they buy a cup of coffee or any product made with sugar next year under our nafta obligations the u s will allow the importation of sugar mainly from mexico at much lower prices than those charged for american sugar the u s government will be forced to purchase huge quantities of imported sugar to prop up the price here in the u s this is expected to cost taxpayers an additional &# billion over the next years the sugar program offered by the house and senate in the new farm bill goes even further by showing complete disregard for consumers on u s sugar policy the most damaging provisions raise sugar prices even further divert any surplus sugar into ethanol and away from food use and place new restrictions on much needed imports of sugar but the unseen "sugar tax" on the american public has other effects as well between and american companies that use sugar in their products shed more than jobs unless congress does something to reform the sugar program this negative trend will only continue a price support program that leans so heavily on import controls cannot survive in an environment of lower trade barriers in addition to increased imports next year as a result of nafta future trade agreements are likely to create even greater sugar import obligations tom schatz president citizens against government waste washington see related letter "letters to the editor helping non farmers too" wsj nov
