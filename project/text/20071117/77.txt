weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink a taste of holiday honey for a holiday so focused on entertaining thanksgiving has been woefully lacking in drinks associated with the festivities christmas has a long history of seasonal quaffs but aside from wine to go with the dinner and beer to go with the football thanksgiving has traditionally been as dry as an overcooked bird yes there is a rather obscure old drink called a pilgrim cocktail but it doesnt have much to do with turkey day once upon a time massachusetts produced pilgrim brand rum and just as a drink of bacardi lime juice and grenadine was called a bacardi cocktail the same drink made with pilgrim rum instead of bacardi was called a pilgrim cocktail i think were long overdue for a holiday drink or two with which to celebrate thanksgiving but what i went looking for clues and inspiration in the pilgrims own cups there is an assumption that the colonists being by and large puritans had a puritanical aversion to alcohol not so the crowd that landed at plymouth looked at alcoholic beverages as a natural and normal accompaniment to a hard days labor and a healthful alternative to dubious water the colonists used whatever was at hand to fashion something potable around an anonymous pilgrim poet composed an ode to "new englands annoyances " among the complaints was an absence of barley "to make into malt " but not to worry "for we can make liquor to sweeten our lips of pumpkins and parsnips and walnut tree chips " that said the pilgrims disdained drunkenness especially if it had overtones of pagan abandon non puritan colonist thomas morton set up a libertine commune up the coast from plymouth and called it merrymount there was no shortage of "dancing and frisking" with native women there and so much drinking that puritan governor and scribe william bradford described the scene as "ye beastly practices of ye mad bacchanalians " in mortons crew raised a towering maypole and sang jolly songs written by morton "some tending to lasciviousnes" with lyrics such as "drinke and be merry merry merry boyes " myles standish was sent with a militia to chop the maypole down and put morton in the stocks mortons excesses notwithstanding the pilgrims were not averse to hard liquor though they seemed to save the ardent spirits for medicinal purposes and also for special occasions as when a tall fellow in a loincloth named samoset became the first native american to present himself at the plymouth colony having met a few european fishermen over the years samoset knew enough english to ask for some beer but this was a moment calling for more ambitious hospitality and so samoset was presented with "strong water " together with "biskit and butter and cheese &amp pudding and a piece of mallerd all which he liked well " colonist edward winslow recounted a few days later samoset returned to plymouth this time with squanto the two of them doing advance work for a chief named massasoit after the pilgrims and the natives exchanged a few hostages to ensure everyone behaved massasoit himself entered the little village he was met with great ceremony by the colonys governor john carver who poured a glass of brandy and drank a toast to the sachem the cup was handed to massasoit who having no experience with liquor tossed back the whole glassful a quantity of "strong water" that made him sweat all the rest of the parley at the first thanksgiving chances are some more of those strong waters were poured around and perhaps also some metheglin a spiced drink of fermented honey metheglin was a popular drink of the day both high and low queen elizabeth had been a fan of the stuff and royals were still drinking it half a century later samuel pepys wrote in his diary of visiting court one july day in and being served some iced metheglin left over from the kings table "which did please me mightily " we know the pilgrims liked the honey brew because they ordered a shipment of two hogsheads about gallons to be delivered by the friendship alas when the boat finally arrived "ther was but gallons of the hogsheads " recalled william bradford the same william bradford who had so disapproved of the merrymaking at merrymount in his "history of the plymouth plantation " bradford bitterly fingers the friendships crew writing that the metheglin had been "drunke up under the name of leakage and so lost " i challenged some first rate mixologists to come up with a thanksgiving day drink inspired by that empty cask of metheglin the parameters were fairly simple the drink should involve honey and at least a few of the spices that have been used in metheglin over the centuries oh and yes it should appeal to the modern palate perhaps the most ambitious entry came from greg lindgren an owner of the san francisco bar rye he proposed poaching quince in honey water and mulling spices and then using the warm fruity broth to flavor a glass of brandy very nice indeed if you succeed in finding fresh quince kim haasarud who runs an l a cocktail consultancy called liquid architecture came up with a terrific aperitif for those hours spent waiting for the turkey thermometer
