weekend journal food &amp drink thanksgiving cold turkey theres the better part of a pound bird still sitting in the fridge what now raymond sokolov on how the pros handle thanksgiving leftovers from mexican style mole to the hot brown i leave the story of squanto and the grateful settlers to sentimentalists and historians but the edible side of the holiday is a subject i feel competent to chew over especially the twin problems of how to cook this pectorally distorted creature the turkey and more importantly what to do with its leftover flesh the day after thanksgiving and the day after that and on into the next week this is a mini cuisine of soups and a la kings and above all sandwiches the supreme example of which i recently tasted at its birthplace the brown hotel in louisville ky anyone who has spent derby day in louisville has tasted a hot brown or at least been exposed to it at derby breakfasts that would include native son muhammad ali and visiting horse breeder h r h elizabeth ii it is a well known regional specialty mentioned in john t edges authoritative "southern belly" and jane and michael sterns "roadfood " before you try your hand at making a hot brown however you have to roast your gobbler and fail to consume the whole thing on thanksgiving our supermarket turkeys are the descendants of mexican birds exported to europe in the th century improved by breeding and then shipped back to north america where they are available year round frozen behemoths like the modern thanksgiving holiday itself the thanksgiving turkeys we buy in supermarkets are a modern invention and skeptics must make the best of them like all poultry these birds are inherently hard to roast because the breasts cook faster than the thighs and legs and dry out while the dark meat gets done in your better parisian bistro they solve the problem by serving poultry chicken or pheasant turkey is rarely seen in two courses white meat first as the dark meat finishes roasting that way theres no need for brining or protective aluminum foil tents or arduous tricks with special tools for flipping the bird in the oven to keep its edematous poitrine from desiccation to avoid such gyrations not to mention the banality of serving plain roast turkey many innovative restaurateurs around the country are attempting to attract thanksgiving diners with some twists on the feasts main course in far from puritanical las vegas thomas kellers beautiful recreation of a lyons bistro will lure diners from the lots with wild turkey and applesmoked bacon and a wild turkey hen egg vermilion in chicago promises an indian latino medley of grilled turkey breasts with mango and cumin as well as pumpkin tres leches the grille at the morrison house hotel in alexandria va is planning a turkey roulade a turkey leg confit and pumpkin bread pudding and for the displaced texan yuppie new yorks hill country is taking orders for whole pit smoked turkeys to go for most people however thanksgiving will remain a communal or family celebration perhaps the only day of the year when it pays to have two ovens one for the pumpkin pie and one for the turkey and oh that bird big as a fox terrier dumb as a post turkeys dont know enough to come in out of the rain and can in effect kill themselves from exposure if not forced to take shelter they put battery chickens to shame in size in hormone consumption and there is always too much of this very cheap source of animal protein resourceful cooks spring into action as soon as the festal board is cleared first they forage for themselves plucking precious oddments from the carcass the most shameless mockers of cardiological orthodoxy will snip away that grease distended posterior appendage called variously the popes nose the parsons nose or the sultans nose all three names are relics from an era less scrupulous about expressions of religious bias than ours the politically and anatomically correct term is pygostyle literally rump post for the structure of fused vertebra that anchors the turkeys magnificent tail feathers rectrices and also harbors the uropygial gland source of preen oil the yummy fat the bird uses to groom its plumage even better treasures for the knowing forager are the two "oysters " tender morsels of dark meat lurking in small depressions on either side of the back behind the thighs they are oyster shaped but the french name for them is better sot ly laisse or "a fool leaves them there " prosaically the friday after thanksgiving turkey can provide the basis of soup pot pie stir fries turkey mole and turkey tetrazzini a casserole of diced turkey and mushrooms dolloped over pasta and topped with almonds or parmesan cheese this is an american dish invented around in honor of opera diva luisa tetrazzini by according to one account ernest arbogast chef at san franciscos palace hotel new york also claims this dish but i will side with chef arbogast just because i like his name far and away the most popular turkey derivative is that perennial favorite of diners and school cafeterias the turkey sandwich either the turkey club or the hot version on kleenex bread and doused with gluey brown gravy at neillios gourmet kitchen in lexington mass and at nantucket nectars you can stuff yourself on turkey terrific a sort of thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich filled with sliced turkey cranberry sauce and stuffing on me it exerts a proustian force conjuring memories of both my aunts bertha filling my plate with all the thanksgiving leftovers at once nothing prevents you from whipping up the same ingenious compressed essence of thanksgiving in your own kitchen and you could even claim you invented it if clueless weekend guests ask what it is i myself am willing to believe that neillios occupies the space where this all american dish was first slapped together some time before but claims of precedence in such matters are hard to establish fortunately the origins of americas most celebrated turkey sandwich are unchallenged and probably unchallengeable i speak of the hot brown devised in in louisvilles grand brown hotel by chef fred k schmidt as a novelty replacement for ham and eggs at the midnight suppers that followed big dances at the hotel you can still experience this pinnacle of turkey haute cuisine at the brown hotel in its hallowed traditional form nominally a sandwich the hot brown is actually a casserole of sliced turkey breast toast and bacon covered with an egg thickened mornay sauce white sauce with parmesan see recipe i tried this myself at the brown it arrived steaming hot on a ceramic mini skillet and is not a true sandwich the toast notwithstanding to put it plainly you cant pick it up a knife and fork are indispensable the thing hasnt lasted years for nothing though the combination of familiar ingredients is more than the sum of its parts a happy salty mix that guarantees white meat of turkey with a moist mouth feel which may even be good for hangovers as claimed by its fanciers this is a tasty if old fashioned dish a bit like welsh rarebit or chipped beef on toast it also does fill one up after that lunch in the browns cheery street level dining room i moved slowly but completely satisfied up fourth street to the seelbach louisvilles other dowager hostelry where my plan was to try the glamorous oakrooms chic variation on the hot brown in it quail subs for turkey pancetta for bacon but id already eaten too much to do this concoction justice so that gives me a reason to return to louisville to continue my gastronomic research and to decide whether the pristine hot brown at the brown hotel brooks no rivals and thats not the only culinary reason to head back there my source for all things louisvillian is that voluble native daughter michele slung she is an authority on such oddments as modjeskas caramel dipped marshmallows first prepared in by the louisville confectioner anton busath to celebrate mme helena modjeska the famous polish actress then performing in town and benedictine a sandwich spread of grated cucumber grated onion cream cheese mayonnaise and green food coloring invented by a miss jennie benedict a louisville caterer of yore ms slung thinks i missed the very best louisville food the cold brown an obscure cousin to the hot one as she remembers it from many a lazy summer lunch of her kentucky girlhood the cold brown is an open faced sandwich composed of sliced turkey lettuce tomato hard boiled egg and thousand island dressing you could definitely try this at home im going to and if you dont well in my book youre just a turkey the hot brown  ounces butter flour to make a roux about tablespoons  to cups milk  beaten egg  tablespoons grated parmesan cheese  ounce whipped
