the buzz marketwatch weekend investor temple inland deal not as smart activist carl icahn is nobodys fool but there is a chance he may feel a little like one after temple inland inc taking his unsolicited advice breaks itself up the "transformation " as the restructuring is being called is expected to be completed by year end the plan hatched in february calls for the company to spin off to shareholders forestar real estate group which develops land and guaranty financial group inc which specializes in commercial construction and residential real estate lending it also will pay a special dividend from the recent sale of its timberlands business the whittled down temple inland will focus on corrugated boxes and building products the idea behind the breakup as is usually the case is that the pieces are supposed to be worth more than the whole for a time with temple inland that appeared to be so in a january regulatory filing that disclosed his stake of more than mr icahn said the "conglomerate" nature of the company "obfuscates the true value" of its underlying assets and implies "a value for the shares that is significantly higher than their current market price " the market agreed temple inlands stock jumped the day after the filing to about &# on its way to a high of about &# in july as investors embraced the upcoming changes since then as the real estate and related lending business have come under siege so has temple inlands stock which pretty much is back to where it was when mr icahn first disclosed his holdings and started his rabble rousing it closed friday at &# for temple inland whose remaining businesses rely on land and housing inflation residential construction or stable credit markets the credit crunch and the real estate wreck made for a perfect storm put another way it would appear the timing of the spin offs with the exception of the timberlands business couldnt be worse shares in spin offs often fall as investors in the original company take the money and run by selling the newly independent entities regardless of the fundamentals with mr icahns involvement however temple inland is believed to have drawn many hedge funds and other event driven investors looking for a quick icahn inspired postdeal pop in the stock that may be wishful thinking "this is not a short term trade " warns kishor agrawal an analyst at spin off advisors a chicago based research and investment firm he recommends temple inlands shares but adds that "youll see the investor base churned over by this stock those who dont want to hold real estate will sell it and those long term value investors will buy it at depressed prices " just how depressed is anybodys guess with temple inland currently trading at a premium to the s&amp p a bank index and peer st joe co the risks would appear to outweigh rewards lehman brothers analyst peter ruschmeier values the sum of the parts at anywhere from &# to &# but that assumes the world hasnt changed according to recent pre spin off filings for guaranty for example the bank gets of its retail banking deposits from the part of california that includes stockton the foreclosure capital of the country furthermore guaranty says that half its home loans are secured by real estate in california which in turn accounts for of all loans yet the lehman targets suggest that guaranty would trade at times to nearly three times book value when a rival like corus bancshares which also lends money to builders trades at a little more than half its book value as for temple inland a spokesman says "we continue to believe our transformation plan will maximize shareholder value in a very tax efficient manner and provide our shareholders ownership in three outstanding businesses along with a special cash dividend " mr icahn didnt respond to a query but in a recent interview with fortune magazine he was quoted as saying "the consensus thinking is generally wrong if you go with a trend the momentum always falls apart on you so i buy companies that are not glamorous and usually out of favor its even better if the whole industry is out of favor " hes got that and more with temple inland hopefully hes got the patience too herb greenberg marketwatch senior columnist doesnt own stocks except his employers nor sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of wall street journal publisher dow jones email hgreenberg marketwatch com
