achieving global accord on iran sanctions may be harder by marc champion a face off begins this coming week among the worlds major powers over whether to impose new economic sanctions to pressure iran

meets in vienna to debate the iaeas latest report on iranian co operation with inspections of its fuel program iran says its program is purely civilian the u s and its european allies believe it is for weapons the positions of the u n s big powers are already well staked out the u s britain and france want the u n security council to impose a third round of much tougher sanctions on iran china and russia are reluctant twice already when iran failed to meet suspension deadlines the security council has worked out a middle road of relatively low impact sanctions this time as an end of month deadline for iran to suspend enrichment approaches reaching agreement is likely to be harder one reason is that the security councils strategy has been questioned lately that strategy is to pressure iran to suspend its fuel program so it cant develop the know how to make fuel for nuclear warheads even as it negotiates guarantees of the fuel programs peaceful nature the iaeas chief mohammed

denied the talks china this past week scuttled a meeting on iran of senior diplomats from the major powers scheduled for monday in brussels citing a schedule conflict according to diplomats familiar with the matter "there has been dragging of feet by the chinese" on a new council resolution u s ambassador to the u n zalmay khalilzad told reporters in new york thursday warning beijing that if it blocked further u n sanctions it would be responsible for the failure of diplomacy to rein in irans nuclear program awash in oil revenue iran appears increasingly confident it can outlast the western pressure tehran didnt even reply to an offer from european union foreign policy representative javier solana who negotiates with iran on behalf of the eu and the security councils permanent members to hold talks this coming week ahead of the next suspension deadline
