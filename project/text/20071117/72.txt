weekend journal books in the heart of cardiac care the surgeons by charles r morris norton pages &# the medical magazines stark headline said it all "stab wound of the heart suture of the pericardium recovery patient alive three years afterward " it was and daniel hale williams an african american surgeon reported what would become the countrys earliest widely publicized case of successful heart surgery at a time when the importance of monitoring blood pressure was little understood and the use of antibiotics intravenous fluids and transfusions was decades away the year old williamss accomplishment opened a new vista in american medicine the formidableness of the operation was matched by the severity of the patients predicament a teenager had been stabbed in the left chest and taken to chicagos provident hospital the facility is historically important as the first hospital in the u s organized by african americans for hours williams kept the young man under close observation but with persistent bleeding an increasing heart rate and shortness of breath the injured youth seemed headed toward death the scalpel wielder was forced to take unprecedented action a inch incision was made the inch and a quarter laceration of the pericardium a tough fibrous membrane that envelopes the heart was located and the rent was repaired it sounds so elegantly simple but as any surgeon will testify the up and down movement of the beating heart along with a visual field obscured by free flowing blood made williamss feat an astounding technical triumph fifty one days later the patient was sent home there were no follow up visits and a final note in the case record provided the verdict "termination cured " several years later williams happened upon the teenager hard at work in the citys union stock yards all was well encouraged by his students and members of the chicagos african american community williams wrote about the experience thus heart surgery with its accompanying literature was born in the u s over the next years williamss accomplishment was followed by a remarkable series of scientific successes that allowed cardiac surgery to become a safe reality the first use of a heart lung machine in the earliest successful treatment of coronary artery disease in and the implantation of an artificial heart in american surgeons performed many of these landmark heart operations by the st century cardiac surgery in this nation had become a multi billion dollar business fueled by celebrity surgeons innovative operations and sophisticated heart centers that attracted patients from all over the world charles morris the author of "the tycoons" and "american catholic " among other books found his interest piqued when he came across financial data showing that americans now spend more money on heart disease treatment than they do on new cars in his words "i wanted to learn as much as i could about the heart industry " in "the surgeons " mr morris writes about the inner workings of new york citys extraordinary columbia presbyterian heart center given unique access to surgeons staff and patients he weaves a tale of sophisticated medical care and surgical wizardry the stories are insightful and filled with verve there is the electrifying late night "harvest run" to secure a donor heart the day to day frenzy of a heart surgeon in training and the poignant death of a child from a failed heart transplant "the entire kit of marvels mustered by cardiologists and surgeons in three states had not been up to the task of saving her " but these and other mesmerizing tales occur in the first half of the book the second half of "the surgeons " alas descends into a wearisome analysis of ethics money and greed and their effect on health care in america "it is a system that seems designed for the affluent educated patient with the most comprehensive insurance coverage " mr morris writes "but for the working stiff with minimum coverage it can be confusing difficult to access and possibly even dangerous " one of the culprits of course is "big pharmas corruptions " the worst of which mr morris says "has been the suborning of the clinical testing process " it is a provocative claim but then the author lapses into a soporific and unconvincing discussion of statistical analysis and "the promise of propensity scoring" to glean information from patient databases the promise it seems is that alternatives will be found to random clinical trails "many rcts perhaps even most are useless or worse partly thats because pharmaceutical companies have abused the trial process but its also because of the great difficulty and expense of running good trials " such a complicated subject deserves a fuller fairer and more expert treatment to read the closing chapters of "the surgeons" is to long for the scalpel stories is the book an insightful and captivating account of heart surgeons and their amazing craft the subtitle after all is "life and death in a top heart center" or a dreary socioeconomic study of health care policy "the surgeons" has complications and cries out for a content transplant dr rutkow a clinical professor of surgery at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey is the author of "bleeding blue and gray civil war surgery and the evolution of american medicine"
