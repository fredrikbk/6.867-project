encore a special report health matters in treating ovarian cancer a little known specialist can make a big difference in january peg danowski didnt feel right she had gained seven pounds over the holidays was exhausted and was having odd sensations "like little electric volts running up and down the tops of my legs " she says puzzled the washington d c mother of three went to damian alagia her longtime obstetrician and gynecologist tests showed a growth on her ovary perhaps a benign cyst and he scheduled laparoscopic surgery but when dr alagia inserted the scope he found her pelvic area covered with what looked like blisters he carefully withdrew some fluid and the scope when ms danowski awoke he told her to go see a gynecologic oncologist it was the right call ms danowski had advanced ovarian cancer and needed extensive surgery and chemotherapy today shes in remission and recently went on a trans atlantic cruise with her husband of years "it was like being on the titanic with a better outcome " she says this year more than women in the u s will die of ovarian disease and more than will be diagnosed more than half of the cancers will be found in women older than the risk increases with age most women will be diagnosed at an advanced stage when the disease is especially lethal but unlike ms danowski many wont get the aggressive treatment thats their best shot for beating the disease one problem experts say is that many women with ovarian cancer are treated by general gynecologists or surgeons rather than by gynecologic oncologists who are trained in advanced surgical techniques and other aspects of treatment while general gynecologists often provide excellent care for benign conditions studies show that women with ovarian cancer get more comprehensive care and live longer when treated by gyn oncs as theyre called conversely women do worse when treated by doctors who handle a low volume of ovarian cancer cases often true of general gynecologists even with a busy practice dr alagia director of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery at george washington university hospital sees only a few ovarian cancer cases a year but if it sounds simple enough women with ovarian cancer should see a gynecologic oncologist its not that simple in real life for one thing many women and their husbands dont know such a specialty exists "the importance of getting to a specialist isnt well known " says patricia goldman who helped found the ovarian cancer national alliance an advocacy group in addition ovarian cancer can be tricky to diagnose theres no reliable screening test the symptoms including bloating weight gain and abdominal pain can all be mistaken for digestive disorders when women do have a growth doctors dont do biopsies because puncturing a malignant tumor "could seed the abdominal cavity " says arthur bertchuck director of gynecologic oncology at duke university medical center so while most ovarian masses arent cancer sometimes theres no definitive way for doctors to know before surgery that makes it hard to send women with benign masses to gynecologists and those with malignant growths to gyn oncs to address that two groups the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists and the society of gynecologic oncologists developed joint guidelines on when a patient should be referred to a gyn onc for postmenopausal women the guidelines recommend such a referral when a pelvic mass is "suspicious " as indicated by at least one sign an elevated level on a blood test called ca fluid in the abdomen evidence of abdominal or other cancer or a family history of ovarian or breast cancer mitchell edelson an official with the college of ob gyns who is a gynecologic oncologist in abington pa says the group is trying to impress on gynecologists that all women with suspicious growths should be referred to gyn oncs the risk of ovarian cancer peaks for women in their late s other risk factors include a later menopause defined as after age and being a carrier of the brca or brca genetic mutations which are also linked to high rates of breast cancer overall the incidence of ovarian cancer has risen in recent years to one in women according to johns hopkins university when the disease is found before it spreads beyond the ovaries of patients survive at least five years if its caught after the disease has spread only survive five years the cancer is diagnosed at the early stage only of the time gynecologic oncologists who get three additional years of training in treating gynecological cancers are experts in cytoreduction the removal of cancerous masses which is directly linked to patients chance of survival stephen rubin chief of the division of gynecologic oncology at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania says he has seen patients where a general gynecologist has removed the ovarian mass but missed "the abdominal spread " gyn oncs also do "staging" the sampling of lymph nodes and tissue around other internal organs during surgery the results show the progression of the disease which is critical for deciding postsurgery chemotherapy or other treatment not having such staging is especially dangerous for women who are thought to have early stage cancer but might have a more advanced case because the cancer is lurking out of view at some hospitals gynecologists and gyn oncs work closely together at winthrop university hospital in mineola n y gynecologists who think patients might have cancer schedule surgeries when gyn oncs are on standby that way says eva chalas the hospitals chief of gynecologic oncology "if were needed we are there" to perform the more extensive surgery when ms danowski got sick she was only younger than many women with ovarian cancer she had a family history of breast cancer but didnt realize she might be at higher risk for ovarian cancer it wasnt until after her ovarian cancer operation that she underwent genetic testing and discovered she had the brca mutation when dr alagia while doing the laparoscopic surgery saw that ms danowski had cancer he didnt hesitate to refer her to someone with greater expertise "if it were my wife " he says "i would want her to be treated by an expert " she chose jeffrey lin a gynecologic oncologist who practiced with dr alagia at george washington but has since moved to sibley memorial hospital in washington in june dr lin removed ms danowskis ovaries uterus and fallopian tubes and did "staging" that according to the pathologist showed she had stage iiic ovarian cancer an advanced form dr lin says he removed every bit of cancer he could see ms danowski later underwent an aggressive regimen of chemotherapy today shes hopeful that she will beat the odds ms mcginley is
