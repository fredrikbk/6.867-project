insurance as well as protection against long term care expenses about insurers have started selling life insurance with long term care benefits and six companies are offering annuities with a long term care component according to insurance research firm limra international inc of windsor conn at first glance the products appear to be the insurance equivalent of having your cake and eating it too tom lockwood a year old construction company owner in vero beach fla recently bought a combination policy from new york life insurance co after paying his mothers assisted living facility bills for nine years mr lockwood was familiar with the high cost of long term care and had looked at a wide range of insurance options but when he spoke with his accountant about estate planning options mr lockwood found out he could invest his savings in a life insurance policy with a long term care rider rather than buying life insurance and long term care coverage separately "i was unaware that this product even existed " mr lockwood says "for someone looking for security and concerned about long term care its a great combination " that said the policies arent without their drawbacks products that combine life insurance or annuities with long term care coverage typically involve a single and very steep premium mr lockwood for example paid &# for his policy additionally such products can be numbingly complex buying a hybrid in some cases means combining an already complicated investment an annuity with an already complicated insurance policy a long term care contract to create a product that only an insurance actuary could love a life insurance policy combined with long term care coverage typically involves accelerated benefits meaning that if you need long term care a portion of the policys death benefit is paid out to cover expenses and the death benefit is reduced accordingly with an annuity you generally make a one time payment &# is the example most often used by insurers to buy a deferred fixed annuity with a long term care rider some products let you take regular monthly payments that increase by a certain percentage if you need long term care others function as a souped up savings account for long term care needs and dont allow you to tap the benefits until you specifically need them some annuities give you various options involving the time period for long term care payments the amount of coverage or the type and amount of inflation protection for example genworth financial inc s total living coverage annuity lets you choose long term care benefits worth either two or three times your initial premium benefits lasting either four or six years and inflation protection compounding either or a year insurers of course see the changes in the pension protection act as opening a door to new business "theres a whole reservoir of annuities out there set up for emergency purposes that could be moved into an annuity product with a long term care rider " says mark doherty second vice president for product manufacturing at insurer lincoln national corp of philadelphia mark warshawsky director of retirement research at consulting firm watson wyatt worldwide says hybrid products help bring together two different risk pools "the people who have below average life expectancies are getting long term care insurance they couldnt get otherwise " he says "and the hale and healthy are getting a reduced cost annuity " if youre interested in a policy that combines an annuity or life insurance with long term care protection here are some factors to consider do you really need life insurance or are you at a point in life where you would go without it if you werent enticed by one of these products maureen mohyde director of gerontology for hartford financial services group inc in simsbury conn says hybrid policies arent for everyone because the combination of life insurance and a long term care rider typically costs more than a stand alone long term care policy however if you are leaving a family business to one child and want an inheritance for others have a younger spouse or otherwise need "estate liquidity permanent life insurance may be the product that fits the bill " she says and in that case a long term care rider could be the cost effective choice hartfords rider costs about of what it would cost to buy a comparable long term care policy she says a year old man for example would pay &# a year for the life premium and &# for the long term care rider compared with &# for a stand alone long term care policy if you currently have life insurance that youd simply like to replace with long term care insurance consider this when the pension protection act provisions take effect in you could exchange the cash value of a life insurance policy or annuity contract for a tax qualified long term care policy and the exchange would be tax free currently you would owe income tax on the policys value prudential financial inc is trying to develop life insurance and annuity products that you could buy at a younger age say and then have the right to exchange all or part of the policy at age for long term care insurance says malcolm cheung prudentials vice president of long term care in roseland n j how much long term care insurance do you actually need and will a combination policy provide it consider where you would like to live in retirement the average cost of long term care in that location and the portion of that amount that you want to cover with insurance says phyllis shelton president of ltc consultants a hendersonville tenn consultancy on long term care insurance for online charts on the cost of care in various metropolitan areas go to longtermcare genworth com click on "what is the cost of long term care " or you can go to maturemarketinstitute com and click on "studies " next ms shelton suggests calculating a increase in costs each year until you turn so if youre and nursing home care costs &# a month where you live and you want your benefit to cover of the cost you would need &# a month today or about &# a month in years based on compound inflation using that number you can ask insurance agents how much money you would need to invest in the policies or annuities theyre selling to achieve that goal in years is inflation protection an option some combination life insurance policies and annuities offer inflation protection riders which help the value of your long term care benefits keep up with fast rising health care costs but few make clear the distinction between simple inflation protection which increases your benefit by a certain percentage of the original benefit level every year and compound inflation protection which increases your benefit by a certain percentage of your new benefit level each year "a lot of times consumers dont think about it and they arent being advised about it because its just a rider " says julie mcpeak executive director of the kentucky office of insurance in frankfort "people generally dont realize that inflation protection is important until its too late " something else to watch for sometimes inflation coverage applies only to a policy extension you purchase ms shelton says in that case she recommends withdrawing the policys or annuitys main benefit as quickly as possible so the additional benefits which have inflation protection kick in faster how would you fare in underwriting the screening for life insurance typically involves a complete physical exam looking for heart problems and other potential killers while long term care insurance screening is more likely to focus on the likelihood of dementia arthritis and other chronic conditions so depending on your health strengths you might qualify for a better rate for one or the other but not both in contrast the life care annuity products could be open to just about anyone not currently receiving long term care for example state life insurance co a unit of oneamerica financial partners inc of indianapolis has been selling a life care annuity even without the tax advantages for a decade as an alternative that doesnt require much underwriting says bruce moon state lifes vice president of marketing it provides access to the annuitys cash value for long term care expenses and has an optional rider providing lifetime coverage with the pension laws passage the company is updating the product to meet the requirements for policyholders to get tax free benefits are you handing over a lump sum or paying a yearly premium some people prefer to pay a large chunk one time to buy a combination life long term care policy this approach of course means you give up the time value of your money but benefits through life insurance riders you pay for each year could change or premiums could increase depending on the language of your policy can you get the benefits you want in each piece of a combined policy "youre giving up a lot of flexibility to pick the best life product and the best long term care product " says byron udell chief executive of accuquote an insurance sales web site based in wheeling ill "some carriers are great on long term care but just do a decent job on life " he advises "approach each risk that youre trying to buy or manage individually and force it to compete in its own arena " ms
