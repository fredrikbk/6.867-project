hot topic washington itches for a budget battle president bush delivered the first of several promised vetoes on spending bills this past week and the fight escalated when congressional democrats invited another veto by tying new iraq war funds to a troop withdrawal timetable both parties have been spoiling for a budget battle that lets them frame their priorities ahead of next years elections mr bush and his allies want to establish their credentials as fiscal conservatives while democrats have pushed measures to alleviate financial pressures on the middle class the white house opposed a spending increase when it vetoed a &# billion bill for domestic programs this past week and republicans sustained that veto by two votes thursday democrats say the veto reflects republicans misplaced priorities rather than fiscal discipline because it came the same day the president signed a &# billion defense spending bill that boosts pentagon funding before figuring in an additional &# billion requested for the wars in iraq and afghanistan heres a closer look how much additional spending have democrats proposed democrats have proposed &# billion of discretionary spending on top of the &# billion in mr bushs proposed budget about half of that additional spending was in the measure vetoed by the president who said the bill had been larded with earmarks including money for a prison museum and a sailing school the president has sought to cut funding for the labor health and education departments each year and lawmakers have rejected the cuts including &# billion the administration aims to trim this year mr bush has also threatened to veto a transportation and housing bill that includes &# billion of new spending much of it for bridge repairs spurred by the collapse of a minnesota interstate highway bridge this summer why has president bush threatened more vetoes many republicans believe their party lost its congressional majority last year because it failed to control spending during six years of republican rule when the president vetoed only one piece of legislation which involved federal stem cell research funding congressional earmarks or outlays inserted without debate that direct funds to specific projects soared to &# billion in the fiscal year from &# billion in and the governments &# billion surplus in swung to a &# billion deficit three years later with mr bushs approval ratings mired at around and with few remaining legacy issues to concern him the white house believes it can gain more by standing for principles less spending and lower taxes than by seeking compromise with democrats can the democrats override any vetoes republicans have stood firm so far but many have taken heat in their districts for twice voting against expanding a popular childrens health care program and mr bush two weeks ago saw congress successfully trump his veto of a water projects bill democrats charge that mr bushs recent calls for fiscal discipline are hypocritical because he did little to discourage profligate spending when republicans controlled capitol hill and because he has requested tens of billions of dollars in emergency war funding under democrats watch earmarks were reduced to about &# billion in the fiscal year their lowest level since mr bush took office how likely is a compromise democrats have suggested bundling the remaining spending bills while cutting their proposed spending increases in half to &# billion the government has already passed two interim spending bills and has until dec to finish the budget pass another interim measure or face a government shutdown something neither side appears willing to do since it could further drag down job approval numbers for both lawmakers and the president can democrats use spending bills to force withdrawal from iraq on friday the senate fell seven votes short of passing the house measure tying war funds to troop withdrawals which faced a likely bush veto in any event defense secretary robert gates warned that continued delays could force him to lay off employees and terminate contracts in the army and marine corps early next year nick timiraos points of view the majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility but so far its acting like a teenager with a new credit card " president bush "given his dismal record of maxing out americas credit card the president is in no position to lecture congress " speaker nancy pelosi facts the word "veto" doesnt appear in the u s constitution congresss approval rating has fallen to from in march and is now near the level of support for republicans when they lost their majority last year in budget disputes between president clinton and the republican led congress resulted in two government shutdowns totaling days the fiscal year budget wasnt enacted until april more than days late president reagan who vetoed spending bills turned to a famous clint eastwood line when faced with congressional stalemate in "i have only one thing to say to the tax increasers go ahead make my day " the national debt totals &# trillion this year americans will pay &# billion of interest on that debt or cents on every dollar of government revenue congress overrode a veto by president bush for the first time two weeks ago president lyndon johnson was the last president to have all his vetoes over five years sustained this years &# billion federal deficit is nearly the size of chiles gross domestic product or the equivalent of spending about &# every second &# million every hour or &# million every day of the year presidents have made vetoes and congress has overturned them on occasions a rate of presidents have vetoed appropriations bills and congress has overridden or about of those vetoes
