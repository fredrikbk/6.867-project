encore a special report in search of a purpose marc freedman thinks encore careers can help baby boomers and the country with retirement for many americans now expected to stretch out or years the question arises how best to fill that time perhaps the answer is an "encore career " thats the hope of marc freedman founder and chief executive officer of civic ventures a san francisco nonprofit focused on expanding the contributions of older americans in the past decade mr freedman has emerged as a leading voice in discussions nationwide about the changing face of retirement now in a book titled "encore finding work that matters in the second half of life " he explains why people in their s and beyond still need "productive relationships" joining with others in pursuit of a larger goal "study after study shows that individuals want to hope to and need to continue working at the age when previous generations retired " he says "and we need them to as well as labor and talent shortages crimp key sectors such as education health care nonprofits public employment and even the clergy " to learn more about following new paths in later life we recently spoke with mr freedman from his home in california here are excerpts from that discussion the wall street journal what is an "encore career" mr freedman i see an encore career as having five key characteristics first its a significant body of work one that could entail say or or even years of your life it takes place in the second half of life after the end of a midlife career ideally it involves some type of pay or benefits and at its core its about the search for new meaning and a deep desire to contribute to the greater good a prime example would be someone who after spending years as a money manager decides in his or her s to become a math teacher or to launch a second career with an environmental organization wsj how is that different from "working in retirement" mr freedman a retirement job is a way to make ends meet between the end of ones working life and the beginning of full retirement so its a bridge a transition more than a destination an encore career is a goal in and of itself for many people its the opportunity to do what theyve always wanted to do wsj and what would be a real life example mr freedman in my book i write about ed speedling he was the first person in his family to graduate from college he went on to get a ph d and had a midlife career in academic health care that he was very proud of but there was an ache in him that came out of an experience he had while still in college he was coming up from a subway station in new york and encountered a homeless woman he gave her a dollar but felt that he just hadnt done enough even though people told him to forget about it and focus on other things that experience kept coming back to him finally he decided that when he reached a point where his work in academic medicine had run its course he was going to return to that earlier calling so in his late s thanks to some contact he had with a priest in philadelphia he was able to land a position at a homeless shelter and he worked there for several years and developed some knowledge of how agencies work with the homeless in time he used that experience to move to another organization which was more innovative and was tackling the causes of homelessness and so there was a series of jobs that ultimately led to what he had hoped to do to address the problems of the homeless directly on the streets and also at the root together they add up to the encore career that hes had wsj does an encore career primarily involve volunteer work mr freedman not necessarily we know that longer working lives are going to be a necessity for millions of individuals and the question of how to make a virtue of that necessity how to find work thats not just another years at the grindstone but work that people can genuinely look forward to and be proud of isnt just a financial necessity but a fundamental aspiration so i think people are looking for work that not only pays the bills but also connects them to other people provides structure in their lives and enables them to use their experience in a way that is valuable wsj what do you say to the person who says "yes an encore career makes sense but i want to travel i want to spend time with my grandchildren " mr freedman i would like to think that people will "retire" or what weve come to think of as retiring for a year or two or maybe even a little longer with the knowledge that its not forever that its not an endless vacation people can use that time first of all to catch their breath and rest up they can take the trips theyve wanted to take and spend more time with family and grandchildren and they can begin thinking about a new phase of work one with greater flexibility than their first careers and that allows them to pursue those things that interest them so if people can craft a sabbatical and use that time in part to think about a new phase of work that offers greater balance in their lives all the better wsj how does one find an encore career what are some of the steps a person should take mr freedman again its important for those who have finished midlife careers if at all possible to take a breather to rest think and gather energy for the next phase of life and work during this time its useful to come up with a realistic and perhaps interim objective say becoming a substitute teacher or interning for an organization thats tackling global warming these experiences can help you discover what you would really like to do for your encore career its important to consider whether you want or need some kind of educational experience perhaps at your local community college to help bridge the gap from your midlife career to your encore career as in any job search it makes sense to talk to as many people as you can consider it a research project whos happiest whats working for them what can you learn from their mistakes two last things to remember this process is anything but linear people often find their perfect encore career by just pursuing what interests them or by just doing what they have to do the volunteer board member who steps into the job as interim executive director or the daughter who nurses her mother at the end of life and then decides that hospice work brings her peace and satisfaction and finally this process takes time be patient youre launching a phase of life that could be decades in duration wsj are there some fields in particular that lend themselves to encore careers mr freedman the most natural places to look are fields where labor shortages are already impinging and those areas are education health care and the nonprofit sector but theres another area which isnt as easily defined and thats social entrepreneurship theres a need for new solutions to serious problems in many spheres and thousands of older adults are already using their experience to come up with answers for these problems wsj who would be a good example of that mr freedman one of my favorite examples is gary maxworthy hes a guy who wanted to go into the peace corps when he was younger but couldnt afford it at that point so he moved into a career in the food business and ended up becoming one of the most successful food distributors in northern california his wife passed away when he was he re evaluated his life and decided to make a change eventually he gave up his six figure salary for a &# a year position through vista at the food bank in san francisco and in the context of working at the food bank he realized that food banks all across california were primarily distributing canned and prepared foods and he knew from his earlier experience that growers in the state were throwing out an enormous amount of food that was either blemished or not restaurant quality so he developed an initiative farm to family that this year will distribute million pounds of fresh produce to food banks in california he would have never been able to do that if he had been in the peace corps or vista at age he was able to use the business skills that he had developed first to see a potential solution and then implement it and do so on a significant scale wsj how realistic is it to think that many americans will find encore careers as they age mr freedman its already evident that a significant segment of baby boomers are thinking about and aspiring to work in areas like education health care and the nonprofit sector on the other side we know that employers in areas like education health care and the nonprofit sector have few alternatives other than looking to aging boomers to meet their talent shortfalls in the coming decades so i think its a realistic possibility that the desires of individuals and the labor needs of employers will lead millions of people to encore careers when we look back at the last century its clear that one of our biggest accomplishments was improving the lives of older adults we really gave people not only a foundation for better lives in terms of independence but we really gave people something to look forward to in later life now the challenge is giving older americans a purpose and a chance to contribute and that could be one of the great accomplishments of the st century
