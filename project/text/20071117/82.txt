weekend journal leisure &amp arts sopranos on the fast track to fame should we worry about the risks to these young photogenic divas for more than a decade it seemed as if operas popular image was inextricably linked to tenors tenors in groups of three "pop opera" tenors and tenors with matinee idol looks but even before the death in september of the worlds most famous tenor luciano pavarotti audiences and the media had begun turning their attention to sopranos in the past year a group of photogenic young sopranos with thrilling voices charisma and musical smarts to match has moved on the fast track to opera stardom it includes american danielle de niese years old whose album of handel arias is climbing billboards classical charts kate royal a british soprano who recently graced the cover of gramophone magazine measha brueggergosman a year old canadian with a new album of schoenberg satie and bolcom cabaret songs and american nicole cabell winner of the bbc cardiff singer of the world competition also the packaging and success of these young divas may bring new energy to opera but it also raises questions does focusing on youth for its own sake lead to more harm than good how many young sopranos are being pushed into heavier roles and a lifestyle of promoting cds and jetting around the world that they are not ready for opera history is littered with sopranos from anna moffo and maria callas to cheryl studer who later paid for early excesses ms cabell whose recent album "soprano" includes arias by puccini bellini and gershwin credits the interest in young sopranos to the "netrebko phenomenon " referring to the year old russian soprano anna netrebko whose silvery voice and flirty sex appeal have driven sales for her label deutsche grammophon "it revolutionized opera " said ms cabell "her sales were so high and shes so glamorous that record companies said wow we didnt realize that if you market a soprano in a certain way and if you have incredible talent and if you combine those two together you might have a great product " voice teachers say that it starts with the supply chain because sopranos voices mature faster than other voice types they can be trained faster and tapped by a record industry eager for good looking young talent "every year the level of talent gets better " said maitland peters chairman of the voice department at the manhattan school of music where sopranos auditioned for placement this year for slots compared with just mezzo sopranos "the training is better their drive is higher the competition is higher and so theyre scrambling to improve and they do the talent is huge and record companies are tapping into that theyre looking for vibrant young attractive people " opera companies find that young sopranos are more willing to take theatrical risks than their older colleagues the slender ms de niese received attention in when she animated the slinky dance moves in david mcvicars bollywood inspired production of handels "giulio cesare " which arrived at the chicago lyric opera earlier this month and runs through dec ms cabell recently appeared in the washington national operas updated production of "la boheme " where she was cast as a raunchy whip wielding musetta benton hess a voice professor at the eastman school of music who has coached ms cabell and renee fleming believes young sopranos meet directors growing interest in dramatic credibility "were a society thats enchanted by youth " he said and because many prominent verdi or puccini roles are supposed to be young women "its such a wonderful idea that you can actually have a young woman playing these characters " at the same time however mr hess believes that early success is risky not just because singers overstretch their instruments but because they often fail to surround themselves with colleagues who provide honest feedback "once you get to the top everybody tells you youre wonderful all the time " he said "this is my fear for these young women who are having all this big success youre always wonderful nobody will tell you youre having pitch problems nobody will tell you this note is ugly or your french isnt good " many of these sopranos maintain that they take steps to avoid premature burnout ms royal who has just released an album of arias on emi said she devotes four months out of her schedule each year to recitals a format that is less strenuous ms brueggergosman who has a large voice and personality to match said she earned a masters degree in german romantic art song partly as a way around the stresses of opera training ms cabell often cites the advice given to her by the legendary soprano joan sutherland after she won the bbc cardiff singer of the world competition "dont let people rush you " ms sutherland cautioned opera professionals point to the cyclical nature of vocal fashions a few years ago mezzo sopranos were the rage and before that it was tenors todays soprano boom echoes that of the s when names like beverly sills maria callas and renata tebaldi were vying for the publics attention but modern sopranos must compete not only with one another but also with the great recordings of the past "a question that must be dealt with is do you displace an elisabeth schwarzkopf or renata tebaldi for young sopranos who might be cute and have a nice personality " said robert aubrey davis program director of xm satellite radios vox channel he added "i tend to be somewhat skeptical of this marketing " nonetheless at least for casual opera consumers there is always a certain hunger for novelty among the best selling albums in the classical section of itunes recently was a pair of pavarotti collections a recording of arias by italian mezzo soprano cecilia bartoli and ms de nieses handel album ms de niese said she chose handel over a mixed repertoire "portrait" album to distinguish herself from the crowd "because so many people put out albums that have a little bit of everything " she said "it seemed much more intriguing doing something im very familiar with ive had success in and i feel very connected to she added that handel which tends to appeal to specialists shows she is serious about a long career "i dont plan on quitting singing in a few years " she said "i want to be around for a long time and its really easy for people to pigeonhole me and say that shes a young singer and shes got an album and a recording contract already im not planning on being a flash in the pan " mr wise is a writer living in new york and a producer at wnyc radio
