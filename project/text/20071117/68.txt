weekend journal books a naturalist in the colonies the travels of peter kalm by paula ivaska robbins purple mountain pages &# i like to see things just as they are and so to relate them " peter kalm wrote in september noting that he was "not fond of the marvellous " the botanist was in albany n y returning from a wilderness trek that took him up the mohawk river and along the shore of lake ontario to niagara falls he acknowledged the immensity of the falls but pooh poohed an earlier claim that four coaches could drive abreast on the ground beneath them kalm did go into great detail on what sort of animal carcasses could be found floating in the pool at the bottom he put it all in a letter to benjamin franklin who published it in the pennsylvania gazette "here you have sir " kalm wrote to franklin "a short but exact description of this famous niagara cataract you may depend on the truth of what i write " kalm was indeed a precise observer of nature who did a great deal to identify the flowers plants and trees of our continent if he is obscure the kalmia latifolia named for him is not in "travels in north america " kalm writes that these particular plants preserve "their fine green leaves throughout the winter so that when all other trees have lost their ornaments and stand quite naked these adorn the woods with their green foliage about the month of may they begin to flower in these parts and then their beauty rivals that of most of the known trees in nature " he is describing what we more commonly refer to as the mountain laurel kalms observations including his mountain laurel boosterism made their way into the official botanical world with the help of carolus linnaeus the polymath whose system for naming ranking and classifying othe natural world is still in wide use today like linnaeus kalm was swedish born though he lived much of his life in finland the two men had met at swedens university of uppsala thanks in part to kalm linnaeuss "species plantarum" included more than new world species it was linnaeus and the swedish royal academy that had sent kalm to america in in search of plants that might be useful in northern europes cold climate kalm always referred to linnaeus as "the master " in turn linnaeus understood that plant searching required a "young penniless bachelor" willing to sleep "on the hardest floor" or take "the longest road" in search of a plant or moss kalm was the ideal candidate and proved worthy of linnaeuss trust certainly kalm is too little known today "travels in north america" published in swedish in three volumes between and and in english in has been out of print in the u s for many years its first hand information on the daily life of indians and colonial whites rivals its botanical finds so we must be grateful to paula ivaska robbins for the first general interest biography of kalm in english "the travels of peter kalm" does more than recapitulate kalms famous book it recounts both the naturalists youth and his life as a professor in turku finland after his stay in america ms robbins neatly describes the intellectual milieu of the time when everyone who wrote on science seemed to know everyone else it was a time of astonishing scientific breakthroughs as she notes and also lingering ignorance linnaeus was attacked for discussing the sexuality of plants one offended scholar was sure that such "loathsome harlotry as several males to one female would not have been permitted in the vegetable kingdom by the creator " as it happens ms robbins grew up speaking finnish as well as english making her well suited to kalm research just as important she feels an enthusiasm for the vegetable kingdom that comes through on every page we learn from her and not from kalm himself who died before he could recount his trip in full that in western new york state kalm stayed with sir william johnson a man who lived in a fortified manor house with his mohawk wife entertained hundred of iroquois at a time and presided over his german tenant farmers and indian allies like a feudal chieftain it was johnson who gave advice to kalm about the naturalists two trips to canada provided guides through the forest and arranged the party of indians who paddled kalm across lake ontario to the french outpost at fort niagara in america kalm complained that the "sole care" of its english and dutch inhabitants was "to scrape a fortune together " while the french in canada paid more attention to his scientific efforts but once back home he longed to return to america griping that the long finnish winter was like "living in a dark sack " only a few of the kinds of seeds that kalm brought back to northern europe thrived in their new environment sweet potatoes and wild rice were failures watermelon did slightly better with greater success kalm and his university students built an indian style birch bark canoe the swedish king adolf fredrik paddled around in it during a visit to finland in happily mr ferguson is a writer in highlands n c
