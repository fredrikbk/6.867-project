bond funds are victims of timing thinking worst was over top performers now lag behind after successfully dodging the bond market storm earlier this year several big mutual funds thought the worst was over it was a bad call and now theyre feeling the pain the result some funds with great long term track records including funds from capital research &amp managements american funds and legg mason inc s western asset management group have taken significant hits in just the past month or so some that have long been top performers are now posting below average returns and lagging behind the broad bond market by anywhere from one to nearly five percentage points a huge gap for bond funds some of these funds used a "bull market strategy" of buying on a dip says jeffrey gundlach manager of one bond fund that has largely avoided the recent damage that strategy "doesnt work in a bear market " he says mr gundlachs tcw total return bond fund which focuses on mortgage backed securities continues to shy away from investments tied to lower quality mortgage securities thats help lead to a gain so far this year beating of the competition similarly pacific investment managements pimco total return fund managed by bill gross has steered clear of investments like these and has maintained its track record the funds doing the buying took small positions in battered bonds backed by subprime mortgages or in debt issued by beaten down mortgage lenders such countrywide financial corp in general mutual funds have steered clear of the risky mortgage backed securities market which has inflicted tens of billions of dollars of losses on wall street giants including merrill lynch &amp co bear stearns cos and citigroup inc indeed bond fund managers in general take credit for being better than these giant wall street firms at spotting the early warning signals a year or two ago of housing market trouble they say it was clear to them for instance that lenders were making it too easy for borrowers to get mortgages by offering no down payment loans to buyers with poor credit there were warning signs in other parts of the bond market too suggesting that the prices on riskier securities were vulnerable to big declines says tad rivelle a portfolio manager on the metropolitan west total return bond fund "we recognized that the corporate bond market the high yield market as well as the subprime market" were all making borrowing too easy perhaps the most vocal warning was issued by mr gross of pimco a unit of allianz se in mr gross began worrying about the impact that a collapse in the housing market would have in and repositioned his portfolio toward lower risk investments it turned out that he was early in his prediction and as a result his funds performance fell far behind through the first half of this year now however his total return fund is beating of rival funds so far this year with a gain percentage points ahead of the benchmark lehman brothers aggregate index "when the tide goes out you get to see whos swimming naked " mr gross says "pimco has had its bathing suit on for a long time " mr gross says expecting a housing downturn and a deterioration in mortgages and derivatives related to that in late summer the bond markets were roiled by the credit crunch and prices fell sharply for mortgage backed securities as well as bonds issued by mortgage lenders and high yielding corporate debt it was around that time when some bond fund managers felt the declines were starting to look overdone american funds &# billion bond fund of america which is ranked among the top of its morningstar inc category for the past five years was among them for example five year debt from countrywide had fallen significantly in price so that its yield went from about percentage point above comparable maturity treasurys to as high as points above treasurys it was much the same story for debt issued by residential capital llc or rescap a unit of gmac financial service bond fund of america also added some rescap holdings making similar moves was western asset management the countrys biggest bond manager the firms core bond fund had already been lagging behind in part owing to the firms typical strategy of holding more corporate and market backed bonds and less of lower yielding treasurys which were rallying western added subprime debt as well as bonds from countrywide and rescap for a while it looked smart countrywides bonds rallied so that the yield hovered around two percentage points above treasurys and there was a slight rebound in subprime prices then in late october the mortgage market imploded a second time the abx index tracking triple a mortgages the highest rated kind collapsed from around to the high s countrywide fell back to about five percentage points over treasurys where it remains "we thought we had a pretty conservative position " says james hirschmann chief executive of western compounding the woes related to the mortgage market western also suffered as corporate bonds were hit to a similar degree the two markets dont generally move in lockstep in the recent downturn they did says mr hirschmann meanwhile bond fund of america is lagging behind of its rival funds and is returning percentage points less than the lehman aggregate index in some managers who stayed clear of subprime such as mr rivelle as well as those at blackrock inc are now dipping their toes in the water gregory zuckerman contributed to this article
