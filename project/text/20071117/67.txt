two cheers for bob zoellick in september we warned new president robert zoellick that unless he cleaned out the guardians of the world banks status quo they would "be after him next " were semi pleased to report partial progress on tuesday mr zoellick announced the departure of paatii ofosu amaah a bank senior vice president and its corporate secretary readers will recall that it was mr ofosu amaah who according to our sources sought to prevent former president paul wolfowitz and his girlfriend from so much as testifying in their own defense or making their case in public during the kangaroo court proceedings that forced mr wolfowitz out earlier this year also being eased aside is managing director graeme wheeler another leading conspirator in the wolfowitz coup mr wheeler later made himself notorious for his efforts to undermine the work of the banks own anticorruption unit int in october mr zoellick appointed a third managing director to the bank and effectively relieved mr wheeler of most of his significant operational responsibilities which had included oversight of some of the banks most corrupt projects in south asia mr zoellick is also taking some much delayed action against a shockingly corrupt world bank project in the philippines in the bank began financing something called the national roads improvement and management program which was designed as a three phase nine year project involving bank loans of up to &# million as usual this was designed with various anticorruption bells and whistles also as usual none of them worked once the project got started and every internal incentive was for shoving money out the door in int began looking into the project despite the bank bureaucracys assessment that all was going well by october int had discovered instances of collusive bidding involving companies working as a cartel in early two members of that cartel were murdered while on their way to meet int investigators forcing int to pull its staff from the country bank bureaucrats led by james adams the vice president for east asia nonetheless decided to go forward with the projects second phase here readers might recall mr adamss star turn as the man who tried to give the cambodian government a corruption pass after int revealed systematic abuses of world bank projects in that country a pattern a bank source tells us that bank bureaucrats tried to prevent the disclosure of the int investigation to the banks own board of directors in order to win approval for the philippine projects expansion happily mr zoellick has now done the right thing formally postponing the second phase while int begins debarment proceedings against the firms involved in the first lets hope mr zoellick and the banks board draw the obvious conclusion and end all loans for the rest of the project which were expected to run to nearly &# million more troubling is mr zoellicks handling of the banks business in iran in july a bipartisan u s congressional group wrote mr zoellick urging him to cancel some &# million in undisbursed loans to the islamic republic yet the bank has refused to do so claiming recent u n security council sanctions have no bearing on its projects thats true narrowly speaking then again its telling that the bank has recently been forced to find new ways to transact business in iran after iranian banks were sanctioned by the u s for sponsoring terrorism or financing nuclear programs leaving aside the larger political issues at play there is also the question of whether the banks projects in iran are actually helping their intended recipients mr zoellick might want to peruse an internal march midterm review of the banks reconstruction work in bam the city devastated in a december earthquake the review notes that "the operational results achieved so far appear somewhat less than encouraging" and that "there is sufficient evidence to reach the conclusion that implementation is becoming somewhat worrisome justifying immediate and decisive measures " this language is all the more striking given the banks habit of putting the best possible gloss on its own work given how much of the iranian economy is controlled by the islamic revolutionary guards corps and given how difficult it is to monitor the flow of funds in the country from which int is effectively barred mr zoellick has every excuse he needs to kill the loans without heaven forbid appearing to do the bush administrations bidding no doubt this would earn him some additional enemies within the banks bureaucracy then again when it comes to the world bank any president who doesnt make enemies isnt doing his job
