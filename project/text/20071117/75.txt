weekend journal entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies animation isnt just kid stuff ratatouille and beowulf help show how the craft has become a vital force this weeks column is animated by the conjunction of two signal events the arrival of pixars glorious "ratatouille" on dvd and the bursting forth of robert zemeckiss bemuscled "beowulf" on big plus the biggest meaning imax screens the films are products of different animation technologies and look as different as mutant peas in separate pods the one exuberantly artificial the other suggesting during much of its length live action that has somehow taken on a fantasy life of its own but the signal sent by both of these productions is unmistakable a process once confined to a relatively small realm has become a vital force in the evolution of the movie industry a few decades ago movies fell into one of two categories they were either live action for general audiences or they were cartoons which meant antic shorts or disney features made mainly for kids those categories overlapped only when live actors were used in conjunction with cartoon characters as in gene kellys dance with jerry mouse in "anchors aweigh " or with stop motion models as in the original "king kong " or such ray harryhausen classics as "jason and the argonauts " in our computer age though animation is everywhere as fx enhancements of live action films and in a proliferation of full length features much of it is mediocre at best while some of it is mediocre and hugely profitable jerry seinfelds "bee movie" is already a hit but the best of todays animated films offer adults as well as kids a range and depth of experience thats seldom matched by live action much of which is downright lifeless that best means not only features like the cream of pixars crop which includes almost the whole of pixars crop or such gleeful entertainments as the first "shrek " no one who has seen sylvain chomets "the triplets of belleville " or hayao miyazakis dreamlike masterpiece "spirited away " is likely to forget them the same goes for "paprika " a japanese anime extravaganza recently released on dvd the defining characteristic of the anime style is so called limited animation that looks like graphic novels come to life but the genre can accommodate on occasions like this one seemingly limitless imagination "paprikas" tumbling succession of bizarre images may well be the most eloquent visualization of the dream state in film history indeed animation which lends itself so readily to surrealism may play to our subconscious in ways that live action cant some adults simply dont like animated films no matter how complex or enchanting they continue to see them as the exclusive province of kids or maybe they process them through unknown synaptic filters that block enchantment i seem to be prejudiced in the opposite direction the first movie i saw as a child in the pre tv days when seeing a movie meant going to a theater was a primitive betty boop cartoon the thrilling dance of wriggly black lines on the white screen must have patterned my tender cortex indelibly and left me vulnerable for the rest of my life to the delights of movie fantasy not to mention the pleasures of linguini in squid ink love it or resist it this is a time of accelerating change and increasing impact for the animation arts to revisit brad birds "ratatouille" on dvd is to be re astonished by the beautiful density of detail that summons up the imaginary world of remy the rat while he journeys from provincial france to the pinnacle of culinary prowess as the chef of his own parisian restaurant if "the incredibles" was animations announcement that it could do anything that needed to be done in any film genre sophisticated comedy social comment thrill rides adventures beyond the physical prowess of james bond then "ratatouille" is the confirmation of that announcement in spades and spices with a soupcon of appreciation for perceptive critics thrown in for good measure the esthetic stew of "beowulf" is somewhat lumpier the tortured monster grendel like poor wretched gollum in "the lord of the rings " stands as a spectacular achievement that could only have been processed if not born in the silicon bowels of supercomputers at the same time the movies motion capture technology is as noted in fridays review a process in progress often stunning though occasionally mundane but what hurtling progress it is when you compare what this film has achieved with the state of the art only a few years ago then add the startling improvements in d you get a sense of what bold new worlds the movie business will be exploring and of why james cameron a filmmaker with the clout to use any format that strikes his fancy has already opted for both motion capture and d in his forthcoming feature "avatar " on that one my prejudice kicks in with a vengeance i can hardly wait morgensterns picks animated tales when you consider that someone surfing the web on a smartphone is using more computing power than the apollo astronauts did in landing on the moon its no wonder that computer animation is such an amazing success story even today though it isnt the only story in animated films tron the granddaddy of computer animated features is years old but still worth a look not only to see how far weve come but to discover what groundbreaking work in computer graphics went into this sci fi thriller which was directed by steven lisberger one thoughtful critic on the internet movie database says "tron" was a flop because the concepts it dealt with cyberworld vs real world werent yet in the public consciousness thats true though the films stark look also militated against it jeff bridges voiced the computer programmer flynn who gets sucked into a computer chicken run common clay can be the stuff of dreams this delightful feature length comedy by nick park and peter lord is a shining and squawking and flapping example of clay animation the same process that the co founders of aardman animations used to create their wonderful wallace &amp gromit shorts "chicken run" is an escape drama set on a chicken farm in yorkshire in the s mel gibson is the voice behind rocky the freedom loving rooster who with ginger the chicken organizes the prison break that saves them and their fellow fowls from becoming chicken pies corpse bride stop motion puppetry is tim burtons medium here this movie which comes and goes in a mere minutes was co directed by mike johnson and centers on a pinch faced groom named victor voiced by johnny depp who is torn between victoria the flesh and blood beauty to whom hes betrothed and corpse bride the blue faced maggot ridden creature who still manages to be winsome almost lovable "i know that i am dead " she says ruefully "yet it seems that i still have some tears to shed " in tribute to the stop motion master ray harryhausen victor is seen playing a harryhausen piano
