cross country newburghs newcomers newburgh n y can new immigrants save an old city its a question a lot of mid level cities ask themselves as they look to follow the path blazed by new york and chicago which revitalized themselves in recent decades and here miles north of new york city on the west bank of the hudson we may have an answer newburghs arc is similar to other towns in upstate new york it was once a majestic city with thriving commercial and manufacturing centers and boasting beautiful federal style greek revival and victorian homes it has one of the largest historic districts in the northeast and breathtaking views of the hudson river but failed development efforts destructive welfare policies and shifts in the economy left the city a shell of its former self in new york state took stock of newburgh and labeled it one of the states most "stressed" cities a conclusion come to after finding a large number of vacant buildings and single parent households and that a staggering of adults in the city dont have a high school diploma and are not in the workforce one neighborhood nicknamed "crackhead university " was the subject of a documentary by that name distributed by russell simmonss hip hop channel the film interviewed crack addicts some doing drugs in front of buildings designed by famous architects such as calvert vaux this is the carnage wrought by events starting in the early s it was during that decade that the citys train station a vital link to new york city was closed thousands of welfare recipients were also dumped in the city from westchester county which is directly across the hudson river among other places in time magazine dubbed newburgh "welfare city " by the s simmering racial tensions boiled over into race riots and violent crime was spiraling out of control slum lords came to rule the city and factory jobs disappeared the city seemed powerless even as these forces tore it apart in the s city manager joseph mitchell gained national fame by attempting to force welfare recipients to pick up their welfare checks at the police station that and other efforts to curb public assistance failed in part because they were viewed to be motivated by racial animus meanwhile "urban renewal" projects had disastrous results federal and state funds were used to demolish hundreds of buildings many along the river front as part of an ambitions reconstruction project but when it came to building anew the money dried up and newburgh was left with the wreckage of failed policies now the city seems to be turning around in the s it began redeveloping its waterfront and it had the good fortune to see a former air force base transformed into stewart international airport a rudy giuliani type policing approach of aggressively going after criminals has driven violent crime down since city manager jean ann mcgrane and mayor nick valentine are looking to build on these shifts in fortune by pushing property owners to either sell vacant buildings or fix them up ms mcgrane has a simple way to do this "we find out who owns the boarded up building whos responsible for its repair and we institute aggressive code compliance to encourage owners to fix it up or sell it " she said mayor valentine is just as blunt "this may be borderline harassing but these arent good people we need them to fix their buildings " their efforts are paying off the number of derelict buildings has fallen to from in january and the city is also selling buildings it acquired through tax foreclosures today it owns down from about a few years ago "we did this year and will do next year " says ms mcgrane "you cant get rid of them all at once because we need to do it the right way with the right developer " a strong indication that the city is on the right path is that its now a magnet for new immigrants one of whom is barbara ballarini shes from rome italy and in march brought a little cafe culture to newburgh by opening caffe macchiato on liberty street near a house once used as a headquarters by george washington most of the newcomers however are either hispanics who speak little english or more affluent migrants from new york city "new yorkers dont have the fear factor " mayor valentine said "they see that an area might be troubled but that newburgh is moving in the right direction so they invest here" by buying &# homes needing repair the mayor knows the effect immigrants can have on a city because hes the grandson of italian immigrants he owns a tailor shop in a formerly italian neighborhood on broadway a wide street that serves as a spine for the city his neighborhood is now filling with latins "they remind me of my family who came to newburgh because others from their section of italy had come " he told me "theyre looking for locations for storefronts to open businesses usually grass roots enterprises like hairdressing auto repair landscaping food shops restaurants theyre very religious my old church sacred heart just had their first spanish mass people came " the city is also now working with new urbanist developer leyland alliance to redevelop acres cleared in the s but never rebuilt it will include housing and shops and encourage pedestrians to enjoy the city hundreds of people turned out to comment on leylands proposal most in support racial and class tensions remain however as i speak to leyland architect giovanni palladino while standing on a knoll high above the hudson river a car pulls up and a woman inside says "go back where you came from " she didnt mean it this way of course but in a sense thats exactly what newburgh is trying to do ms vitullo martin is a senior fellow at the manhattan institute
