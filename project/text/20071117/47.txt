paulson comes to defense of the dollar treasury secretary henry paulson fine tuning his rhetoric on the falling u s dollar said friday that the currency ultimately will reflect strong u s economic fundamentals the remarks dont suggest a change in policy but likely will be viewed by markets as a more vocal defense of a strong dollar policy while continuing to repeat his mantra that a "strong dollar is in the nations interest" mr paulson offered a slight shift in language by linking the value of the currency to the "long term strength" of the u s economy "we have very much a strong dollar policy thats in our nations interests " mr paulson said in a radio interview in south africa where he is traveling to attend a meeting of finance ministers from the so called group of the group includes the worlds seven leading economic countries the u s britain germany france japan canada and italy as well as emerging economies such as india brazil russia china and saudi arabia "our economy like any other has its ups and downs and its long term strength will be reflected in our currency markets " peter kenen an adjunct senior fellow at the council on foreign relations called the treasury secretarys new tone "a significant change in rhetoric because it at least hints that what mr paulson is looking to is an end to the depreciation and perhaps a turnaround of the dollar and that he doesnt regard the present value of the dollar as being strong or satisfactory " the dollar has hit record lows against other major currencies in recent weeks including the euro and the british pound and it is weakening against the japanese yen while a weaker u s dollar helps the u s economy by making u s exports more attractive overseas it is a concern to financial markets which worry it could spark inflation and make the federal reserve less likely to cut interest rates robert sinche head of currency strategy at bank of america said wall street has been waiting for the bush administration to make a stronger case for the dollar but that the comments are "a week too late " "theres a bit of a view in the financial markets that the u s if not encouraging a weaker dollar was certainly engaged in benign neglect with respect to the dollars decline " mr sinche said he said the possible impact of the stronger rhetoric is uncertain because concerns about the dollar have already spilled into other asset markets stronger rhetoric is one of the few tools at washingtons disposal while previous administrations intervened to prop up the dollar by buying the currency the bush administration hasnt shown any inclination to follow suit preferring instead to let currency values be set by the market mr paulsons new rhetoric comes on the heels of similar language used by both president bush and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke who recently suggested that a strong economy will translate into a strong dollar
