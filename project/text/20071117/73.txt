weekend journal books magician joker star the lets get small comic revisits the days before he got big born standing up by steve martin scribner pages &# a legacy of the decade ive spent dabbling on the fringes of standup comedy is the email i sometimes receive but never respond to that sounds like this recent message "we will be a having a comics with cars showcase at stand up ny there are scores of professional comics in and around new york city who are constantly looking for an opening act to drive them to a gig all comics appearing on the show will be required to bring at least people " deconstructing this email yields a crash course in the dire economics that accompany an addiction to performing on a bare stage with only a mike and a stool for company the email reveals a new show business hyphenate to go along with model actress chauffeur comic and in this context that seemingly innocuous verb "bring" actually means "you will dragoon seven of your dwindling band of friends into paying the cover charge or you dont perform " life at the bottom of the comedy food chain was not much different in the summer of when a year old amateur magician and moonlighting actor named steve martin showed up for an audition at a san francisco club called coffee and confusion growing up in orange county in the s mr martin was a southern california theme park urchin one who had honed his prestidigitation skills by demonstrating tricks at merlins magic shop in disneyland and had mastered stagecraft by performing in melodramas at knotts berry farm on the coffee and confusion stage that long ago monday night this clean cut banjo strumming kid had an epiphany he could do comedy well by pretending to do comedy badly his opening line "hello im steve martin and ill be out here in a minute " gave a hint of the absurdist flavor of the act but the show stopper was something the comic ballyhooed as "the napkin trick " he unfolded an ordinary napkin displayed it in all its paper product glory to the sparse crowd and then stuck his wet tongue right through it as he recalls in "born standing up " a memoir of his life as a comic "i bowed deeply as though what i had done was unique in the history of show business " a few days later he added a prop to enliven the inevitable dead moments onstage an arrow through the head getup that become his comic trademark "born standing up" is a slight but ingratiating account of a not always rollicking road trip that took mr martin from auditioning at coffee and confusion to playing nightly in basketball arenas before screaming fans in the late s as mr martin now an actor screenwriter novelist playwright says "i was seeking comic originality and fame fell on me as a byproduct " before he slunk away from standup at the height of his "im a wild and crazy guy " white suited renown in he would morosely retreat after a show into his hotel room displaying the symptoms of a "depression caused by exhaustion isolation and creative ennui " what probably saved him from a lenny bruce john belushi fate were his roots as a "good baptist raised boy" and his peculiar for the era aversion to drugs they literally triggered panic attacks from his opening observation that "doing comedy alone onstage is the egos last stand " mr martin is consistently intuitive about the craft of single handedly making strangers laugh in a dark room while they fulfill their two drink minimums the cultural upheavals of the s and s made punch line dependent comics like bob hope seem as dated as war bond drives and dorothy lamour jokes explaining his theory of what might be called anti comedy mr martin writes "what if there were no punch lines what if there were no indicators what if i created tension and never released it what would the audience do with all that tension " early in his career mr martin brooded about his inability to stretch minutes of good material into a minute act if he did not get laughs there is an analogous problem with "born standing up " which even at pages seems padded we learn far too much about a childhood that featured "silent family dinners" and about the authors emotionally distant parents especially his father a would be actor turned real estate agent who was so embittered that he wrote a negative review for a realtor newsletter about his sons breakthrough appearance on "saturday night live " whatever mr martins lasting pain he later forged a partial reconciliation with his father who died in there is nothing avant garde about the revelation that often clowns are laughing on the outside but crying on the inside still there are lovely moments in the book such as the authors affectionate re creation of his mid s romance with "a sylph like" photographer named mitzi trumbo the daughter of once blacklisted screenwriter dalton trumbo it is hard not to smile when picturing the comic just a few years removed from merlins magic shop sitting in rapt wonder at trumbo family dinners where the guests might include writer ring lardner jr or director george roy hill the love affair ended when mitzi trumbo took up with director john frankenheimer who years later as mr martin reveals in an acid aside "tried and failed to seduce my then wife the actress victoria tennant " this embarrassing detail is actually the setup for the perfect pitch chapter closing line "incidentally frankenheimer died a few years ago but it was not i who killed him " with the fading of woody allen whose personal life caused his image to curdle steve martin now occupies that hallowed niche as the literary worlds favorite comedian an excerpt from "born standing up" ran in the new yorker he wears this bookish crown with grace but his reputation enhanced by the wistful slender novel "shopgirl" grants him a level of self indulgence that is at odds with the discipline he once brought to his manic standup act "born standing up" is a pleasant book but not nearly as memorable as the onstage career it commemorates mr shapiro the washington bureau chief for salon com has intermittently performed standup in new york clubs since
