taxis tissues and a great wall thinking about traveling to china for the olympics heres what to expect for tourists who prefer to take the road less traveled china presents a problem what is one to do about a country that is already the worlds fourth ranking tourist destination and about to be blitzed with hordes of visitors to next years olympic games in beijing the answer for my wife and me recently was to go before the flow grew too great with the chinese busily sprucing up their cities and adding new amenities such as deluxe hotels in anticipation of the games in august it seemed an ideal time for our trip we took a typical china tour with visits to beijing guilin xian and shanghai took a cruise on the yangtze river and tossed in a few days in hong kong along the way we picked up some ideas of what to expect for other first time tour takers to china in the coming months heres a look getting around if youre on a tour transportation usually by chartered bus isnt your problem but plan on spending a lot of time in airports and getting to and from them since flying is the only way to fit in a tight tour schedule fortunately the airports connecting tourist destinations are good with facilities updated in recent years but a word of warning on domestic flights the chinese dont board by row number they just crowd the gate and sometimes the airlines overbook our tour leaders way to avoid hassles was to get to the airport early and plunk down his groups bags in front of the boarding gate for quick access to our planes on the ground public transportation isnt so easy in the cities but taxis do just fine so long as you can show the address in chinese where you are going security presence for now theres no problem although its going to be tight by the time the olympics roll around next summer the police presence in beijing and elsewhere isnt particularly noticeable perhaps because the chinese rely more on plainclothesmen and closed circuit tv cameras to monitor sensitive spots such as tiananmen square our groups only brush with the authorities was at the airport in guilin when a guard for reasons never made clear prevented one person from taking a picture of a friend at a boarding gate inside the terminal health precautions no question beijing has a big pollution problem exacerbated by throngs of automobiles that have replaced many of the bicycles that were the common mode of travel in past years in short order my wife and i developed coughs and sneezes that we attributed to unhealthful air as for the locals we saw nary a one wearing a surgical mask the pollution protection of choice in many asian cities we were forewarned about health issues by our travel book which listed recommended items to carry in a personal medical kit to china but that seemed to be a bit extreme besides in a tour group theres bound to be at least one hypochondriac with a surplus of medications to share stock up on tissues though which are good for the sniffles and better for public restrooms to improve the citys cleanliness along with its public image beijing officials have attempted to discourage local citizens from a habit of spitting on the sidewalks the effort may be working though we were on the lookout we werent confronted with the problem until we were on a stopover in vancouver on our flight home i was seated eyeball to eyeball in the airport waiting area opposite a gentleman from china when he unhesitatingly spat on the carpet in front of us shopping the first shopping experience will probably be with the street vendors who pester anyone and everyone with their cheap wares the vendors who favor postcards watches hats fans and t shirts will even pursue people for blocks and except for the postcards which may not be a bad deal after some haggling their merchandise is suspect the t shirts are often referred to as "three generation shirts " they fit the buyer and then after washing the buyers child and then a grandchild so where does one shop if you are on a tour you dont have to ask shops will be available in your hotel on the cruise ship on the yangtze and even in the school you may visit our trip included a visit to a jewelry store cloisonne factory carpet factory and embroidery "research institute" each one enticing us with a demonstration of how their goods are made after each lesson we were voila escorted into gleaming showrooms where squads of salespeople attached themselves one on one to every tourist encouraging them to make a purchase they have undoubtedly learned their tactics from the street vendors did some of us decide to skip these visits not a chance we may not have bought anything but these places have some of the better restrooms around the food unless your experience with chinese cooking is limited to chop suey the food should be fairly familiar on a tour lunches and dinners in restaurants are mostly served family style with six or more people seated around a table with a large lazy susan in the center dish after dish is placed on the revolving tray and diners take what they want when the food comes around the good part dishes that dont seem too inviting can be tentatively tasted or skipped as they come by the bad part the best dishes may be gone before they get to you most hotels frequented by tour groups provide western style breakfasts for travelers who want familiar food at other times there are always mcdonalds and starbucks to be found even more prevalent are kfc restaurants my wife and i held out on skipping the local fare until the end of our tour when we succumbed to a meal at ruths chris steak house in hong kong alas that was the one time in our trip that i had a bad case of indigestion but i cant blame ruth her steaks were great i overate the sights the more than terra cotta warriors horses and chariots in xian are extraordinary and the views along the yangtze and li rivers are impressive and of course no self respecting tourist will leave china without a visit to the great wall one of the seven ancient wonders of the world the question is just where that visit will take place and how much there is to see the most visited spot is at badaling about miles northwest of beijing where theres a tram to carry the less adventurous to the heights but the tour companies that promise off the beaten path visits generally shun badaling in favor of a half dozen spots near beijing our great wall experience was at juyongguan a modest site miles from beijing with relatively few vendors to pester us and more than adequate views after a good hike up the wall the climb was somewhat precarious some steps were rough and lacked railings the only casualty on our entire trip was our tour leader who jammed his hand when a tourist fell back on him as she was climbing the steps on the wall while the wall is an impressive sight so too is the surge in construction of high rise buildings in chinas major cities the skyline of beijing is studded with tower cranes as buildings pop up almost overnight and someone who hasnt been to shanghai probably cant comprehend the sprouting of glitzy skyscrapers in the city particularly in the pudong section just across the huangpu river from the citys main tourist area that was mostly farmland years ago it still amazes our local guide a native of the city whats not so visible the site of the olympic games in beijing yes we did get to see the main stadium but only from a quarter mile away when our bus made an illegal stop on a busy highway we had just a few seconds for a "photo op" before we had to hurry on which brings me to a word on picture taking be prepared to add to the memory capacity of your digital camera or load up on rolls of film as the temptation is to shoot at everything in sight and expect to do a lot of editing when you get home and decide that the "car beautician" sign you shot at an auto detail shop in hong kong wasnt so memorable after all i dont have that problem at the moment since i havent yet culled the worthless shots from a previous trips collection mr may is a writer in morris township n j he can be reached at encore wsj com
