weekend journal books the case of the pyongyang bank heist hidden moon by james church thomas dunne pages &# with his second mystery thriller in as many years james church the pseudonym of a former western intelligence officer shows again how well the school of hard boiled american crime fiction translates to the corrupt byzantine world of the north korean state bureaucracy the no nonsense inspector o introduced last year in "a corpse in the koryo " returns in "hidden moon" and faces another daunting assignment when his new boss at the ministry of peoples security orders him to investigate a bank robbery in pyongyang inspector o is immediately suspicious sensing that this highly unlikely case there has never been a bank robbery in the city is one the government would rather not see solved o tries to persuade his boss to file it away and forget about it but the boss insists and o begins his investigation with the silk stockings that the robbers used as masks they are embroidered with the monogram of a shady pyongyang nightclub at the ankle and top of the thigh "very sexy not where anyone would normally look " o observes during an encounter with the clubs proprietor "not normally inspector " the man replies "but it happens people sometimes look in funny places " the books often sharp repartee is reminiscent of raymond chandlers dialogue while the corrupt north korean bureaucracy provides an exotic but entirely convincing noir backdrop with inspector o mr church has succeeded in creating a detective on the model of sam spade and philip marlowe but one with enough quirks o is given to woodworking with exotic lumber to make him seem both unique and somehow instantly familiar like the detectives in classic noir tales o deals with his fair share of femmes fatales but the strictures of north korean society make the flirtations more likely to lead to comedy than romance at a hotel restaurant where a japanese businessman is bellowing out karaoke o and a waitress tease each other about which of them should sit on the mans lap to make him stop the inspector observes sardonically that doing so is "probably against the law in both cases though id have to check for sure which one is considered worse " although mr church doesnt mention the north korean regime outright os investigations are constantly muddled by political intrigue the unraveling of a mysterious assassination plot involving a visiting british dignitary further complicates os task the twist is a typical frustration for a man seeking the truth and yet trapped in the half light of the hermit kingdom the few images of north korea that leak out to the west make it seem a bleak threadbare place but the author whose publisher says that he has long experience as an intelligence operative there shows us mountainous landscapes and lush forests and even though his characters complain quietly about their surreal world they are quick to defend their country inspector o scoffs at ideological purity but he rebukes any foreigner who dares bad mouth his home he tells one visitor that "what happens here is not yours to worry about its for us its our business our future our fate " such a belief may be naive but it is mr churchs artful illustration of how human nature still functions no matter how corrupt or brutal a state apparatus might be decent citizens as embodied by inspector o never really beat the system but like marlowe and spade before him inspector o navigates the shadows and every now and then finds truth in the half light ms malenic is a writer in washington
