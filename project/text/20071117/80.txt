weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations on setting an example i thought id say a word for the beaconists this election year we will sooner or later be asked to think about and concentrate on what american foreign policy should be in the future we will have to consider or reconsider what challenges we face what the world really is now after the cold war and after what is needed from america and for her in some rough and perhaps tentative way we will have to decide what philosophical understanding of our national purpose rightly guides us part of the debate will be shaped by the tugging back and forth of two schools of thought there are those whose impulses are essentially interventionist we live in the world and must take part in the world sometimes perhaps even often militarily we are the great activist nation the spreader of political liberty the superpower whose meaning is made clear in action the other school holds profound reservations about all this it is more modest in its ambitions more cool eyed about human nature it feels more bound by the old advice attributed to one of the founding generation that we be the friend of liberty everywhere but the guarantor only of our own much has changed in the more than two centuries since he said that many wars fought treaties made alliances forged and yet as simple human wisdom it packs a wallop still those who feel tugged toward the old founding wisdom often use the word "beacon " it is our place in the scheme of things it is our fate and duty to be a beacon of liberty to stand tall and hold high the light to be an example to be an inspiration to encourage we do not invent constitutions and impose them on other countries instead they in their restlessness in their human desire to achieve a greater portion of freedom will rise up in time and create their own constitution and because they created it and because it reflects their conception of justice they will hold it more dearly so we are best in the world as it is now the beacon not the bringer of freedom we are its friend not its enforcer as a foreign policy this sounds or has been made to sound unduly passive well sit around being a good example and the rest of them can take a hike but if you want to be a beacon its actually a hard job it involves activism you cant be a beacon unless as a nation youre in pretty good shape you cant be a beacon unless you send forth real light you cant be a beacon unless you really do inspire do we always no were not always a good example for the world and so for the coming holiday a few baseline areas some only stylistic in which we could make our light glow brighter in and for the world it would be good to have the most visible symbols of our country the president and the congress be clean so often they seem not to be they are scandal ridden or an embarrassment or seem in the eyes of the world to be bought and paid for by special interests or unions or industries or professions whether you are liberal or conservative you agree it is important that the world be impressed by americas leaders by their high mindedness and integrity leaders who are not dragged through the mud because they actually dont bring much mud with them there is room for improvement here to be a beacon is to speak softly to the world with dignity with elegance if you can manage it or simple good natured courtesy if you cant a superpower should never shout never bray "were no " if youre no you dont have to to be a beacon is to have a democracy in which issues of actual import are regularly debated instead our political coverage consists of daily disquisitions on "targeted ads " "narratives " "positioning" and "talking points " we really do make politicians crazy if a politician cares only about his ads and his rehearsed answers the pundits call him inauthentic but if a politician ignores these things to speak of great issues we say he lacks "fire in the belly" and is incompetent so many criticisms of politicians boil down to hes not manipulating us well enough we need more actual adults who are actually serious about the business of the nation to be a beacon is to keep the economic dream alive were still good at this the downside is the rise in piggishness that tends to accompany prosperity it is not good to embarrass your nation with your greed it disheartens those who are doing their best but are limited or unlucky or just havent made it work yet it is good when you have it not to keep it all but to help the limited and unlucky and those who just havent made it work yet keep it going porky to be a beacon is to continue another thing were good at making the kind of citizens who go into the world and help it the doctors the scientists the nurses they choose to go and help the world notices and says "these are some kind of people these americans " to be a beacon is to support the creation of a culture that is not dark or sulfurous or obviously unwell we introduce our culture to our new immigrants each day through television just for a moment imagine you are a young person from africa or south america a new american you come here and put on the tv for even the most innocent know that tv is america and america is tv and you want to learn quickly what you see is an obvious and embarrassing obsession with sex with violence with sexual dysfunction you see the routine debasement of women parading as the liberation of women conservatives have wrung their hands over this for a generation but really if you are a new immigrant to our country full of hope animated in part by some sense of mystery about this country that has lived in your imagination for years you have got to think this is it this ad for erectile dysfunction oh i have joined something that is not healthy sad to think this they want to have joined a healthy and vibrant and well balanced nation not a sick circus i havent even touched upon poverty the material kind and the spiritual kind i havent touched on a lot but if we were to try harder to be better if we were to try harder to be and seem as great as we are we wouldnt have to bray so much about the superiority of our system it would be obvious to all as obvious as a big light in the darkness to be a brighter beacon is not to choose passivity or follow a path of selfishness it would take energy and commitment and thought weve always had a lot of that a happy thanksgiving to all who love the great and fabled nation that is still this day the hope of the world
