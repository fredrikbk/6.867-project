encore a special report ask encore tackling questions on social security s and medicare im turning my husband is and has been collecting social security for the past years i have worked many years and can receive social security on my own work record can i take social security at under my husbands record and then when i turn take my full social security i have called social security about four times with this question and have gotten different answers mary fellows walnut creek calif you cant start collecting a reduced spousal benefit before full retirement age and then later switch to an unreduced benefit based on your own earnings says social security spokeswoman dorothy clark under social security policy she explains if you file for a reduced spousal benefit or a reduced earned benefit and are also eligible for the other benefit you are "deemed to have filed" for both as for the social security staffer who told you that approach was possible ms clark says "i apologize for the misinformation " we get many questions about the interplay of earned and spousal benefits and the answers can be very different depending on the circumstances say for instance you wait until full retirement age to collect at that point as explained in our cover story you could indeed file for only a spousal benefit a few years later you could file for an earned benefit that would be enhanced by waiting the situation plays out differently if say a womans earned benefit is small and her high earning husband hasnt yet retired she could collect a reduced earned benefit when she turns and see her social security check increase in a few years when her husband retires and she steps up to a spousal benefit but in that case because she started collecting before her full retirement age that spousal benefit would still be less than it would have been if she had waited until her full retirement age to collect can year olds open a plan for themselves in hopes of using it to take courses in retirement art history in florence dinosaur digs in montana for example and then change the beneficiary to our children or grandchildren when we stop taking courses as a corollary question could my year old son unmarried start a for his graduate school education and transfer the balance in the future to educate his children joseph boccuzzi trumbull conn the ability to change beneficiaries is an attractive feature of college savings plans yes individuals can set up the tax advantaged accounts for themselves and later direct the money to children or grandchildren in the case of your son he could change the beneficiary of his account when he has children that said the fact that a program or tour labels itself as "educational" doesnt necessarily mean you can use dollars to pay the bills the programs that youre looking forward to in retirement must involve "qualified education expenses" for you to be able to pay any of the cost through withdrawals without owing income tax for instance you wouldnt be able to use the money tax free for room and board expenses unless you were at least a half time student says joseph hurley founder of the web site savingforcollege com and to be eligible you would have to be studying at colleges and other postsecondary schools including some overseas schools that are eligible to participate in federal student aid programs according to internal revenue service publication "tax benefits for education " says mr hurley "the tuition must be real tuition " not a payment to a travel company for a college affiliated travel program note also that there can be gift tax implications to changing a plan beneficiary my wife and i opened health savings accounts this year next year we will be and will enroll in medicare may we next year

your hsas once you enroll in medicare you are generally allowed to contribute to one of these tax sheltered accounts only when you are covered by a high deductible health plan but you can each contribute to your hsa from january through the month before you enroll in medicare prorating your allowable annual contribution for the number of months involved irs publication which covers hsas and related accounts gives the example of someone who turned in july of last year and would have been eligible to contribute &# to an hsa over the course of the full year that person was entitled to contribute &# between january and june but nothing for july through december even once you are no longer eligible to contribute to your hsas "you can still receive tax free distributions to pay or
