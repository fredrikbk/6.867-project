capital flight and other policy risks in this fiscal year alone many of our major financial institutions have suffered billions of dollars of losses shaking their foundations to the core weve seen high level management changes and business plans left in tatters to make matters worse the entire securitization based finance system which along with music movies and burgers has been among americas biggest gifts to the world seems to have real cracks and has come to a near standstill were suffering through all of this with oil at near &# per barrel and a dollar that is at historical lows not surprisingly calls for government to "do something" are either self serving or short sighted and would do more harm than good many in the political and business communities are calling for the fed to reduce rates to extremely low levels in order to bail out struggling lenders this of course is meant to stimulate lending activity and thus growth when japan tried the same thing in response to the bursting of its "bubble economy " the result was a year economic malaise rates as low as zero still did not lead to economic growth why because in the period immediately prior to the rate reduction japanese borrowers had feasted on easy credit leveraging themselves to the hilt and were thus unable to react to this beneficence sound familiar furthermore while we have become dependent upon foreign oil our real and primary dependency has always been on foreign investment this foreign money has been leaking its way out of our country and is reflected in the dollars value a further decline in rates which would surely be viewed at home and abroad as a bailout of our weak financial institutions as well as dangerously inflationary would further encourage the flight of foreign capital put simply foreign investment in the u s is far more important to our nation than any of our own large institutions our policy decisions must be calculated to ensure that this investment is once again directed to our country in substantial amounts increasing government involvement in our home mortgage market with aid from fannie mae and freddie mac is another bad idea why do such a thing the logic is as follows right now there are few bond buyers for mortgage backed securities that are not guaranteed by the government or by one of those two agencies so if we can have the agencies underwrite these loans and the government guarantee them the money will once again flow to these borrowers at the heart of this idea is a very cynical view of free markets and a poor understanding of the long term ramifications of expanding the governments reach into the domain of commerce the market is flush with capital yet it is discerning capital it is managed by seasoned and talented individuals bill gross at pimco and warren buffet at berkshire hathaway for instance who are witnessing the unpleasant wringing out of excesses and are wisely waiting on the sidelines until the necessary corrections have worked their way through the system making it once again a safe and smart time to employ their capital such discipline is exactly what is needed in todays market if the fed were to follow the bank of japans lead by reducing rates before the excesses have been fully wrung out from our financial system our current economic malaise would be prolonged and the depth of the crisis would inevitably be greater it is very important to remember that until six months ago our mortgage finance industry was the envy of other nations after years of service all of the value of this system did not disappear overnight who out there really believes that the federal government will be a more disciplined credit underwriter than the marketplace if things go bad again who should bear the losses the banks and their constituencies or taxpayers another misguided attempt to fix the current mess is the effort to create an enormous structured investment vehicle the so called master liquidity enhancement conduit with the stated aim of "unlocking" the asset backed commercial paper market and returning the market to a "normal state " again the thinking behind this reflects a deep distrust of the free market it assumes that there is no one watching and waiting with discerning capital ready to return to a market that is both transparent and offers fair value when that day arrives there will be plenty of capital ready postponing that day will only dig us deeper into our current hole japans no growth s are a prime example of what happens when a country turns to government solutions to moderate the losses of a financial system the japanese market has still not fully recovered conversely in response to similar problems in the s remember the savings and loan crisis the u s government let many institutions fail and allowed others to experience real pain thus setting the stage for a virtually unprecedented year bull market run let us not forget that very important lesson as we start a brand new cycle that said there are a few things we can do to put our financial system and economy on the path to recovery first the fed needs to tighten in order to demonstrate to our foreign lenders and investors that we respect their capital and will not allow it to further deteriorate in value this will attract necessary capital into our country and help sow the seeds of our next bull market second we need to lower tax rates to stimulate economic activity and reward risk capital third we need to insist on transparency in our securities market this comes in a number of forms but perhaps most importantly we need to get the rating agencies to post their ratings models online so that the market can understand the methodology that underlies the credit rating process and can anticipate downgrades rather than be surprised by them finally we need to resist the temptation to turn to our government like a child turns to a parent to ease our punishment by intervening in the market our financial system works in both the good and bad times as long as we are willing to take our medicine when we get sick mr penner is a principal with the firm lubert adler see related letter
