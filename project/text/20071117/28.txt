encore a special report the baby boomers guide to social security the toughest questions the best calculators the coolest strategies and a lot more starting in january the first of an estimated million baby boomers turn years old and become eligible for social security time to reach for the aspirin now in its eighth decade social security is arguably more important and certainly more complicated than ever before boomers for the most part are on their own when it comes to planning for later life pensions and related safety nets are disappearing from the workplace thus social security checks the closest thing to a sure bet in most retirement budgets are expected to play an ever larger role in older americans financial security the process of getting that check however is sure to cause headaches for boomers and bureaucrats alike the social security administrations offices nationwide already see visitors each week and field about million telephone calls a year would be retirees meanwhile are about to discover that many factors taxes a spouses earnings history life spans can muddy decisions about how and when to file for benefits you can of course keep things simple and take the plunge on your nd birthday about half of workers do even if thats your plan you owe it to yourself and your spouse to learn about social security and how to get the most out of the system "dont let social security just happen " says joseph matthews a lawyer in san francisco and author of a guide to the program "there really are a number of variables that people should consider before they start " the basics are available from the social security administration more about that in a moment but to supplement your education consider the following some of the most interesting obscure misunderstood and surprising parts of the year old program the most frequently asked question at the social security administration "how much can i earn and still receive social security benefits " based on a survey of visits to the agencys web site more people in the first six months of this year wanted the answer to that question than any other the question refers to the agencys "earnings test" and the apparent penalty for collecting a salary and social security at the same time it works this way if you are under your "full retirement age" the age at which you qualify for full benefits when you first receive social security payments and if you have earned income &# in benefits will be deducted for each &# you earn above the annual limit in the limit is &# in the year you reach your full retirement age the "penalty" shrinks &# in benefits is deducted for each &# you earn above a higher limit &# in then starting with the month you reach your full retirement age the deductions end what most people dont realize says andrew biggs deputy commissioner for social security is that once they reach full retirement age the agency recalculates their future benefits to compensate for any benefits lost due to the earnings test for most people mr biggs adds "the earnings test isnt a tax so much as a delay in benefits and so they shouldnt stop working or limit their earnings in order to avoid it " the most frequently asked question about social security in financial advisers offices "when should i file for benefits " invariably thats the question planners hear first when it comes to the answer the conventional wisdom is changing where many advisers once recommended grabbing benefits at age at which point your monthly check is reduced permanently by as much as experts today say extended life spans and the demise of traditional pensions argue for waiting until your full retirement age or later to collect a paycheck you get your largest possible benefit at even "foolproof" strategies are no longer looked upon as foolproof "lets say your doctor tells you that you have six months to live " says bruce schobel a new york actuary who worked in the social security administration in the s "so its obvious you take benefits at right " maybe not because of social security rules involving spousal benefits mr schobel says "taking a reduced benefit at could serve as a cap on the surviving spouses payout reducing that persons future benefits by tens of thousands of dollars " "so even an apparently simple decision becomes complicated " he says calculators of course can help we discuss some of the better ones below but first take a few minutes to read a new report "rethinking social security claiming in a k world " written by james mahaney and peter carlson retirement specialists at prudential financial inc its the best discussion weve seen about filing for benefits and possible strategies for doing so note to the give me my money at crowd the authors conclude that changes in social security in recent years "make the value of delaying the receipt of benefits greater than in the past " the report published in august can be found at the pension research council part of the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania go to pensionresearchcouncil org and click on "working papers" and registration is free coolest strategies youve never heard of for claiming benefits one way many couples can maximize social security benefits over their lifetimes is for wives to claim benefits at age and for husbands to delay filing until almost says alicia munnell director of the center for retirement research at boston college thats based on a number of factors including income levels life spans and survivor benefits you can find dr munnells research in the june issue of the journal of financial planning see fpanet org journal and click on "past issues and articles " of course is a long time to wait for social security so heres a way courtesy of steve potter a retired public affairs specialist at social security to avoid the wait and still get a sizable benefit at age the scenario george at his full retirement age of expects a benefit of &# a month his wife martha at her full retirement age of expects a benefit of &# a month the strategy martha files for a reduced benefit on her own at age or &# a month george at age files for just a spousal benefit based on marthas earnings he would get &# a month as marthas spouse yes social security allows george to get half of what martha was projected to receive at her full retirement age then at age george applies for benefits based on his earnings history with the "delayed retirement credit" the additional dollars one receives for waiting until age to claim social security georges benefit would be higher or &# a month social security would stop georges spousal benefit of &# a month because hes entitled to the &# based on his own earnings at age again for this to work george must wait until his full retirement age or later to file for a spousal benefit the nice part about this strategy is that george if hes trying to maximize his and marthas combined benefits doesnt have to wait three or four years beyond his full retirement age for a paycheck he can start collecting benefits at based on marthas earnings history and jump to a considerably bigger benefit at age as far as the "break even" point goes the age at which the accumulated value of benefits from this strategy will start to exceed the accumulated value from both spouses filing for full benefits at age its beyond that age the strategy yields a larger total return this example assumes george and martha are the same age note some social security representatives we spoke with werent aware of this strategy if you try this at your local social security office and if the staff balks ask them to confirm the strategy with social security headquarters in baltimore which confirmed it for us best calculators and sources of information start with the social security administration and its web site ssa gov the calculators alone are worth the visit three benefits calculators "quick " "online" and "detailed" estimate payouts using different retirement dates and levels of future earnings click on "calculate your benefits" on the home page in addition an "earnings limit" calculator illustrates how a salary if you file for benefits before full retirement age and are still working might affect your monthly check from uncle sam a "retirement age" calculator shows how retiring early reduces your monthly payout as a wage earner or spouse and a "break even" calculator shows the age at which the accumulated value of higher benefits for a person who claims social security say at age will start to exceed the accumulated value of lower benefits for a person who opts for social security say at age the site also provides extensive lists of frequently asked questions in categories offers access to dozens of forms and publications and perhaps most important allows you to perform a number of tasks online including filing for benefits and thus avoiding a trip to the social security office in all a very valuable tool another useful resource is analyzenow com a web site devoted to retirement issues started by henry k "bud" hebeler a retired aerospace executive and author of two books about retirement planning analyzenow features a number of helpful articles about social security and two calculators that can help users determine the best age to file for benefits two other online resources the national committee to protect social security and medicare a washington advocacy group has a spot on its web site called "ask mary jane" www ncpssm org maryjane there you can email a question to mary jane yarrington a congressional caseworker who joined the group in as a senior policy analyst before you write check the archives for earlier questions and answers second stanley a tomkiel iii a new york lawyer is the author of the "social security benefits handbook" the contents of which are available free at socialsecuritybenefitshandbook com finally if you prefer print mr matthews the san francisco lawyer is co author of "social security medicare and government pensions " one of the best general guides to the program biggest myth and most misused words the biggest myth is that social security will go "broke" or "bankrupt" in coming decades the social security administration in its annual report to congress this year identified three important dates regarding the health of the program first starting in the agency will begin paying out more in benefits than it collects in revenue second in social security will have to tap the principal in its "trust fund" its savings account if you will to meet its monthly obligations the trust fund itself is a flash point in debates about the health of the program some observers including president bush say the fund which lends excess revenue to the federal government and receives special issue bonds in exchange is simply a box full of ious but its a safe bet that when social security needs to draw on the trust fund future congresses and presidents will make sure the treasury doesnt default on those bonds finally in the trust fund will be exhausted at which point the agency will be able to pay only about of promised benefits its certainly not a pretty picture but at no point will social security collapse uncle sam its safe to assume will continue to collect taxes in and beyond part of that revenue will go to social security which will continue to write checks again starting in as things stand now beneficiaries will wind up with payouts worth less than current rules call for and thats grim but broke bankrupt no best source of information on how to fix social security earlier this year the center for retirement research at boston college published "the social security fix it book " the cover of the page booklet describes it as "everything the earnest but over burdened citizen needs to know cheerfully narrated and handsomely presented " that quirky beginning belies what follows the single best guide weve seen that explains why social security is in the mess its in and the leading proposals for restoring it to health you can download a copy free at crr bc edu keep it handy when presidential candidates hold forth on their plans to fix social security most arcane but important debating points speaking of presidential politics the following issues could well figure in the fine print of any "solutions" involving social security depending on a candidates stance on these issues his or her particular solution could end up sounding very painful or just painful try dropping these nuggets into the conversation at your next dinner party time horizons some policy makers argue that we should look ahead years when estimating the shortfall in social securitys finances in which case about &# trillion is needed to close the gap others argue for adopting an "infinite horizon" in which case about &# trillion is needed a trillion here a trillion there changing work force some evidence suggests that older workers are remaining in or rejoining the work force in greater numbers if so and if the trend continues it could ease somewhat the coming strains on social security but theres no telling what baby boomers actually will do in retirement buying power annual cost of living adjustments in social security are based on the cpi w the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers but groups including the senior citizens league argue that adjustments should be tied to cpi e an experimental index for the elderly started in the s this index tracks expenditures among individuals age and older and better reflects theoretically this groups higher spending on health care and other goods and services biggest misunderstanding the biggest misunderstanding is that your particular tax dollars are being set aside for you at social security social security is not and never has been a savings account "your money is not in your account " says dennis oliver a retired social security administration manager who now works as a social security consultant in cookeville tenn rather social security is largely a pay as you go system in which your tax dollars are used to pay current benefits since the mid s social security has been running annual surpluses that have gone into the trust fund consider ida may fuller who received the very first monthly social security check in january she was at the time ms fuller worked for three years under social security before retiring and the taxes on her salary totaled &# by the time she died in at age she had collected &# in social security benefits biggest surprises in congress raised the age at which people qualify for full social security benefits once pegged to age the threshold is increasing gradually until it hits for workers born in or after the problem according to a survey earlier this year by the employee benefit research institute of all workers think incorrectly that they will be eligible for unreduced benefits at age worse think they will be eligible for unreduced benefits before age separately for all the discussion about claiming benefits at age or at full retirement age the decision isnt an either or proposition you can take benefits at any point any day month or year after the longer you wait of course the smaller the reduction in your benefits if your full retirement age is and if you file for benefits at your monthly check will be reduced about from your full benefit file at the reduction is about file at the reduction is about file at and the reduction is about best day of the year to visit a social security office the friday after thanksgiving yes the agencys local offices are open on that day and are usually very quiet mr ruffenach
