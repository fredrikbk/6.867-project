essay doors closing and opening after seven years of writing about retirement our correspondent begins a new journey this is a goodbye of sorts for the past seven years ive shared my thoughts about aging with encore readers now ive decided to take what my editor is calling a sabbatical in order to tend more single mindedly to my health my doctors recommend that i enroll in an intensive pulmonary rehab program that promises to be a full time job allowing scant time to dream up column ideas and meet deadlines im not happy about this turn of events of course writing has been my life for more decades than i care to count and trying to squeeze meaning and occasional humor out of this stage in life has helped me weather the dizzying ups and downs of what ive come to think of as a second adolescence but with wrinkles by far the best part has been hearing from readers who have by turns thanked me laughed with me cried with me advised me and sometimes scolded me still ive reached the point where i have to ration a finite amount of energy and i dont mean gasoline my daily "to do" lists are rarely completed in a day or even a week if i have an evening outing planned thats not a day to try vacuuming the house or pushing a loaded grocery cart around costco at the same time my "cant do" list is lengthening standing for hours at cocktail parties hoofing it around museums painting walls all of these leave me pretty winded this is not the script i wrote for my retirement years from the distant vantage point of my s back then aging meant gray hair and a spreading midsection but slowing down it never happened to my parents until they approached their s so naturally i didnt expect it would happen to me well surprise surprise it did the only consolation for the creeping limitations and indignities of growing older is that my friends and i are all in this together hardly a day goes by when i dont get a call from someone my age sputtering with shock about some new and annoying adversity a friend reports anxiously that shes thinking of wearing a heart monitor her perennially low athletic blood pressure has suddenly soared to i refrain from telling her that only with gobs of medication has mine sunk to those levels another friend buttonholes me at church to complain about her bum knees "i can still dance in these heels " she hisses angrily "so tell me why cant i walk without pain " a man i know confesses that when he took his granddaughter for a carousel ride he found himself unable to hoist himself up on a painted pony "i had to sit on one of the benches for the old people " he says sheepishly we joke about our "organ recitals " these sour litanies of afflictions the most stoic or healthiest among us keep their troubles to themselves but the rest of us continue to gripe protesting the fact that as life goes on doors keep closing "hundreds of doors " agrees one friend in her s disabled with an autoimmune disorder perhaps complaining makes us feel less alone and wards off the heebie jeebies so many of us feel about the relentless onrush of years this palpable discomfort and anxiety even couched as it is in irony and black humor is at odds with our cultures prevailing myths about growing older in these columns i have tried to present an unvarnished look at aging as a counterweight to the misty paradise so often portrayed in the media its fine for a certain bad boy actor from the s now turned spokesman for shrewd retirement planning to declare that our "dreams dont retire " in tv commercials dennis hopper shows vigorous oldsters engrossed in realizing their deepest creative urges hes right retirees never stop dreaming where some of us tend to stumble is in the execution the other day i came up with the idea for a travel agency that would specialize in escorting the elderly disabled to exotic destinations the main snag id need to hire a young able bodied staff to run the company and push the customers wheelchairs wrong dream in deciding to set aside the discipline and satisfactions of paying work my fear has been that life would devolve into a dreary grind of physical therapy and household chores its finally crunch time up to now ive been able to put off the difficult reckoning that comes with true retirement finding a new sense of purpose i know its essential to keep my eye on the future to make plans that i eagerly anticipate the watchword ive decided is realistic fine tuning or tailoring experience to limitations so to dispel the gloom that set in when i was told id need rehab i began planning a trip rigorous travel has become problematic however so it couldnt be a whirlwind tour involving a lot of walking instead we hope to rent a cottage in france next year with our daughter who has never been there ill be able to retreat to an easy chair whenever necessary while delighting in her discovery of the local cuisine and countryside passing on our passions to the next generation be it a favorite author film or foreign city is an underappreciated pleasure of growing older looking ahead i also know ill need novelty companionship and a measure of creativity to feel alive here im relying on a well developed sense of curiosity honed during a lifetime in the newspaper business the other night i saw a program on television that piqued my interest in deep space photography it seems that amateur astronomers now can probe distant galaxies from their home computers connected via the internet to a powerful digital telescope in the mountains of new mexico even schoolchildren can photograph star clusters and nebulae that began sending light our way billions of years ago enhanced with color these images take your breath away in the good sense im thinking that armchair stargazing might be just the sort of sedentary adventure to enliven my later years a new door opening one thing is certain peering into space will put the passage of time in comforting perspective ms
