weekend journal sports &amp recreation golf journal getting out of your own way two teachers whove aided lpga pros focus on removing mental barriers phoenix sooner or later usually sooner every golfer reaches the same conclusion im clearly capable of hitting great shots but usually dont because of screwy things going on up there between my ears unfortunately merely recognizing this state of affairs does nothing to set things right "understanding is the booby prize " says lynn marriott one of two founders of a nontraditional golf school here called vision that seems to be having some success in helping golfers get out of their own way "what were all about is finding practical ways to transfer what students learn out to the golf course " the schools co founder is pia nilsson a former lpga player and swedish national golf coach whose best known student is annika sorenstam the dominant female golfer in the world for most of the past decade the majority of the tools that ms marriott and ms nilsson teach address the mental and emotional barriers to playing better golf both women are experienced well trained swing instructors but they have come to think of the swing as only one small piece of the puzzle "golf is both science and art and for sure the science part the swing technique is important " ms nilsson told me last week during a break in a three day workshop "its just that for most people these days in terms of what they are taught and how they practice the balance is way off " their star student recently is suzann pettersen an lpga tour player from norway who attended a similar vision workshop almost exactly a year ago along with a minitour pro a teaching pro and nine everyday amateurs overall half men and half women although ms pettersen was recognized as a natural talent she tended to fall apart under pressure and had never finished higher than third in an lpga event at the workshop ms pettersen quickly recognized how her emotions were hijacking her game and signed up to work with ms nilsson and ms marriott long term in march immediately after a putting lesson designed to free up her stroke she putted with her eyes closed in the first two rounds at the lpgas safeway international tournament shooting and and finished second four tournaments later eyes open she won the michelob ultra open and has since won four more times on the lpga tour this year and once in europe she trails only world no lorena ochoa on the lpga money list putting with eyes closed isnt something ms nilsson and ms marriott routinely advise except as an occasional practice technique but helping students discover the particular techniques that work best for them is a cornerstone of their method the starting point at every workshop is for students to analyze when and under what conditions they have played their best golf and to work back from there "the moment of truth is when youre standing over the ball totally in the present but its not like you can stay there for seconds it disappears so youve got to make your preshot routines as simple and efficient as possible " ms nilsson explains many of the vision techniques seem easy but are surprisingly difficult to implement in an on course session the students were asked to react only neutrally or positively to each shot never negatively or self judgingly "that one was almost impossible for me but i know i have to get there " says michelle ellis an lpga player from australia attending the workshop last week in the past few years the teachers have incorporated into their curriculum more techniques derived from brain science research "when you get angry or frustrated your body reacts immediately and sends out a flood of biochemicals that can have all kinds of different effects anger certainly can impact your ability to make clear decisions but it also can affect your visual acuity your physical coordination your tempo " says ms marriott consciously controlling emotional reactions to bad shots can help significantly in stabilizing performance theres strong biological support for the age old practice of counting to after something bad happens before reacting in any way other techniques include breathing control and a software based biofeedback system that students can use at home some of what ms nilsson and ms marriott teach is standard mental game stuff such as making all conscious decisions about a shot before moving forward to address the ball but much of their instruction focuses on helping students feel the rhythm of a proper swing and recapture that feeling even under pressure on the course at the far end of the range during one session students were literally throwing their clubs on the through swing to experience a free release at another station one student was calling out distances for another student to hit short pitch shots yards yards yards and then fielding the shots at exactly those distances with a softball glove at another station students practiced making swings at varying tempos from full speed down to of full speed and back again "people are really really bad at practicing " says ms nilsson "they dont practice what theyre going to need on the course they just hit balls or hit putts if you hit balls in minutes but with your full routine and aim at particular targets and dont hit the same shot over and over thats going to do you more good that hitting balls in fact golf is the only game i know of where practice can sometimes make you a whole lot worse not better " the "" in the name of the golf school vision refers to the theoretical possibility of birdying every hole on a par course for a total score of "we believe that someday that will happen but practically speaking what it means for our teaching is not to set any limits " ms nilsson says "my first coach back in sweden talked about pattern interruption breaking out of the old ways of thinking and focusing on whats possible thats what were trying to do here " email me at golfjournal wsj com
