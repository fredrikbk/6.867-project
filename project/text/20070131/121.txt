private equity firm that manages hundreds of millions of dollars for muslim investors in europe and the middle east and is affiliated with a swiss investment group u s authorities suspect of financing islamic extremists federal prosecutors disclosed a grand jury probe of overland capital group inc in filings last week with u s district court in boston while the boston grand jury is examining suspected tax evasion related to complex investment structures the case is being handled by a prosecutor from the justice departments counterterrorism division the filing states in the years since the sept attacks u s counterterrorism agencies have been stymied in several attempts to bring terrorism cases against wealthy individuals from the middle east some prosecutors have pushed the government to use tax laws as a more effective approach a method famously employed against gangster al capone in overland which doesnt disclose its ownership says on its web site that it has made more than &# billion in u s investments for its clients largely in real estate since its founding in october legal records say overland is controlled by a geneva based financial group known as dar al maal al islami trust which was founded by a senior member of the royal family of saudi arabia the u s government is treating the companies as related the justice department is examining "acts and practices" of overland and a dmi subsidiary "that implicate potential violation of the internal revenue code " the filing states dmi is the hub of a network of banks and investment funds across europe and the middle east that cater to muslims interested in strictly following quranic principles such as a ban on collecting interest some dmi affiliates came under scrutiny by u s counterterrorism agencies in the mid s for suspected connections to extremists government records show in general the u s and other western governments are investigating whether terrorist groups are able to move money with help from sympathizers in the islamic banking movement intelligence and law enforcement officials say they are concerned the industrys often opaque practices lend themselves to money laundering and other financial crimes dmi officials have said the company has no involvement with terrorists or extremists "we have never had any relationship with these kinds of people " said mouaouia mokhtari dmis director of corporate affairs none of dmis officials have ever been charged with terror related offenses overland chief executive james godec didnt respond to requests for comment an overland spokesman had no comment while mr mokhtari said there is no relationship between dmi and overland he said "dmi has sister companies and those sister companies have retained overland occasionally as investment advisers " dmi and overland are partners in a joint venture in bahrain and numerous corporate filings in the u s name dmis chief executive as the president of various overland backed investment ventures corporate and bank records show overland has borrowed large sums from a dmi subsidiary the bahamas registered islamic investment co of the gulf ltd legal records also describe dmi as an indirect shareholder in overland two former overland employees also claim in a civil lawsuit that overland is owned or controlled by dmi overland identifies potential real estate investments in the u s such as luxury condominiums and apartments according to its web site its investments include a stake in rental units atop the four seasons hotel in houston it then arranges for its clients to participate in these deals the nature of the tax inquiry isnt explained in the governments filings but overlands foreign backers have structured many of their u s investments through a network of shell companies in offshore tax havens such as the cayman islands according to corporate and legal records using such offshore companies investors can structure their u s investments as loans instead of equity that offers potential tax benefits because interest income to foreign investors is taxed far more lightly than profits from an equity investment such arrangements are legal but only if they arent primarily intended to circumvent internal revenue service rules dar al maal al islami arabic for "islamic house of finance" was founded in the early s by saudi prince mohammed al faisal al saud a pioneer in so called islamic banking senior members of the muslim brotherhood an international fundamentalist group have held positions at various dmi affiliates according to corporate records the
