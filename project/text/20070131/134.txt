two interns score with budweiser ad set for super bowl questions for brant herzer tyler campbell company omnicom groups ddb chicago title art director copywriter just six months ago brant herzer and tyler campbell were working at a barnes &amp noble bookstore in chicago this weekend the duo are expected to join the elite group on madison avenue that has developed an ad for the super bowl the ad industrys biggest stage mr herzer a year old art director and mr campbell a year old copywriter were the creative minds behind one of anheuser buschs super bowl spots the two were part of a group of interns working at anheusers lead ad agency ddb chicago last summer who were invited to pitch ideas for the brewer ddb famous for its "whassup" budweiser ads and "im lovin it" ad work for mcdonalds were hoping to get some fresh ideas out of the younger demographic every year the agency preparing for abs super bowl ads looks over hundreds of proposals for what will likely be nine or ads appearing on the broadcast this is the first time ddb has invited interns to participate in their hunt for ideas the firm says it was looking for a way to get some younger thinking and give interns the chance to gain some real life experience when their internship ended in september the two started looking for work but a few weeks later ddb offered both a job messrs herzer and campbell talk below about what their big game ad looks like how they found the inspiration and why they arent like others in the ad world the wall street journal so how does it feel having a spot in the big game mr campbell the way i describe it to most people its like playing the lottery for or years and you finally hit the jackpot after you win you walk around in disbelief that is what i am feeling right now wsj how did ddb find you mr herzer ddb contacted the guy who runs the chicago portfolio school the ad school we attended and asked if he had anyone just out of school that was looking to get into an agency we competed against six or seven teams made up of an art director and a copy writer during the anheuser busch dance off wsj was advertising your first career choice why mr campbell yes i saw the volkswagen ad during the late s that relaunched the beetle it was the ads that featured the stark white backgrounds one look and i was hooked i was an english major and art minor in college which made my dad real happy there was never any doubt in my mind about what i wanted to do mr herzer i went to michigan state for advertising so i knew early that i wanted to be in advertising wsj what does your ad look like mr campbell it starts off with an eagle flying against a blue sky then two eagles join then another two join the group they form the v formation and they head down to fly over the clydesdales horses who are having a game of football like those famous super bowl ads the eagles do a jet like fly over just like you see at big football game like the super bowl as the eagles fly over two cowboys lose their hats one of the cowboys says "yep " wsj how did you come up with the idea mr herzer i had a dvd with history of nascar so we watched it for some inspiration there was a part about the dayton and there was a flyover so we tied that into having a flyover during a football game then we thought about anheuser busch and football and their football ads using the horses but instead of having a plane fly over we thought of eagles it seemed the best to do that they are majestic animals at the time we didnt even know that the eagle was budweisers main logo mr campbell we actually stumbled upon the eagle thing we knew they were majestic but it was the ddb creative director who said to us do you know that is anheuser buschs logo i was like oh even better after submitting it to the creative directors we got a call in minutes and they loved it they helped us tweak it and rework it a little bit then the spot was presented to anheuser busch its so cool wsj how many other ad ideas did you come up with mr campbell we wrote about or bud light scripts and about or budweiser scripts wsj theyre both big brands were you encouraged to shake it up or were you told not to go too far mr herzer we didnt get too much direction for bud light we were told to make funny commercials that show how its worth it to do anything for a bud light they gave us free range to come up with ideas but budweiser ads were more controlled they wanted us to write spots that used the clydesdale horses they are magical and grandiose there was more constraint put on us as far as the amount of wackiness we could do on the clydesdale horse work wsj the ad world is in desperate need of talent in the digital space as a result salaries in that space are rising as much as why did you not choose to specialize in that area mr herzer tv is where it is at that is what everyone wants to do and we were so lucky to get into this with this client anheuser busch honestly i dont have experience online i love tv i want to do it forever mr campbell i would like to go into digital i am ready for anything we got lucky with anheuser busch people in our situation or people our age get stuck having to do print ad and brochures when they first start out wsj where will you watch the game mr campbell i dont know it could be an eight inch tv it doesnt matter its going to be awesome
