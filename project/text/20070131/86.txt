mood lighting on four wheels car makers add illumination to create interior ambience chryslers glowing cupholders in recent years the auto industry has pushed a flurry of offbeat extras including backseat videogames heated steering wheels and massaging seats now it is selling mood lighting pressing a button on the chrysler sebring sedans key fob yields a bluish white hue that highlights the seats and dashboard general motors corp s gmc acadia crossover wagon uses light emitting diodes or leds to subtly light the center console where radio climate and other controls are located in daimlerchrysler ags redesigned minivans the cupholders glow the new lighting is being used primarily for ambience dim lights are intended to brighten the cars interior without causing glare or distracting the driver they are also used for decoration near door handles window switches and storage bins car makers are hoping that funky interior lighting will attract the attention of potential buyers who are spending more and more time in their cars and set their models apart in a highly competitive market also after decades of focusing largely on the outside of the car the industry is paying more attention to spiffying up the vehicles interior not long ago the simple incandescent overhead dome light was the extent of interior illumination in most cars it came on when you opened the door and went out when you closed it most could be turned on while under way but at least a couple of generations of people recall their parents refusing to turn the light on at night because the glare made it hard to see through the windshield limousines and some large luxury cars have had reading lamps in the backseat for years but manufacturers kept extra light inside cars to a minimum in part because of the energy that conventional light bulbs consume with the new lights car makers are also taking their cues from home design the glow of bulbs leds and on a few models fiber optics are like a road going version of the under cabinet lighting that is now practically required in upscale kitchens david rand executive director of interior design for general motors says car makers are increasingly trying to "choreograph" light so that vehicles seem to greet their owners with approach lights that come on when the doors are unlocked others that illuminate when the ignition key is inserted and more that keep the interior from being pitch black when driving at night the coming cadillac cts sport sedan uses technology that mr rand calls a "light pipe" to form a "halo" of illumination around the perimeter of the cabin he says the company has been looking at lighting as a design element for the past several years but the auto industrys characteristic long development cycles have meant the results are just beginning to reach the market its no accident cadillac is using light in this way rival luxury car maker mercedes benz began using fiber optic lighting in its flagship s class sedan that went on sale last year in that car a glow emanates from behind a band of wood trim that rings the car on the dashboard and doors "because you can bend fiber optics they work well in the s class interior which has a lot of convex and concave shapes " says mercedes benz spokesman rob moran one might expect high tech lighting in a car like the s class which can cost more than &# but mass market car makers are using similar techniques clay dean who oversaw design of the upcoming chevrolet malibu sedan said it and other new cars use light in part "to accentuate interior shapes" like the top of a door panel or dashboard that may have been ignored in earlier versions of the car while luxury models have used subtle decorative lighting for a few years the decreasing cost of leds and the electronics used to control them have helped bring mood lighting to everyday vehicles honda motor co s acura division began upgrading its lights with one overhead led in the tsx sedan now its latest sedan the rl has interior led clusters over the past decade more interior switches and other controls have been upgraded with backlighting but ambient mood lighting is a recent development mercedes benz began selling its e class with a ring shaped ceiling light that dims when the door is closed but continues to emit soft light to make the interior more inviting since then the company has increased the amount of interior lights on certain models in some cases the change in companies approach to lighting is a reflection of deeper shifts in corporate structure tim potok senior manager for interiors with daimlerchrysler says that for decades interior lights were the responsibility of the companys electrical systems department about two years ago the design group took it over "that started a shift in thinking regarding interior lighting " he says when chrysler surveyed customers about their feelings toward cabin illumination the reaction was surprisingly strong he says "we found that lighting can give us function while also serving as a usp " or unique selling point mr potok says alexander edwards a partner with research firm strategic vision in san diego says his companys surveys show that consumers associate good plentiful lighting with high quality and safety "even lighting the cupholders was a strong quality cue that suggested thoughtful engineering and an overall sense of reliability " he says mr edwards says lighting is of particular interest to car makers because its an area where consumers feel there is a lot of room for improvement "theres a strong level of opportunity in lighting because not everyone is addressing it " art spinella president of cnw marketing research in bandon ore credits the automotive aftermarket with making lighting a priority for car makers for years accessory companies have sold led and neon lighting in a range of colors that drivers have used to decorate their cars big car companies have watched closely to see which products are the best sellers "the aftermarket is a great test bed for auto manufacturers because they can gauge consumer interest without having to develop their own products " he says one of the best examples of this is the lighted cupholders on the chrysler vans due to go on sale later this year "thats a great idea because people have been complaining about spilling their coffee in the dark for years " he says
