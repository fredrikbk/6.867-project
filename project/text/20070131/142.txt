he got a disturbing phone call from a saudi arabian businessman the caller said he represented beit al etisallat a saudi consulting firm that had been a business partner of siemens now beit wanted &# million in commission payments if siemens didnt pay up the caller threatened he would forward documents to the u s securities and exchange commission detailing bribes paid on the german industrial giants behalf to win telecommunications contracts in the kingdom mr kutschenreuter says he alerted his superiors including klaus kleinfeld now the chief executive of siemens and heinrich von pierer the ceo at the time mr kutschenreuter also says that with the backing of the siemens management board he reached a deal in january to pay beit al etisallat &# million he says that &# million was for past obligations and the rest was what he describes as "hush money" to make the problem go away it hasnt mr kutschenreuter was arrested in november as part of a widening criminal investigation that has shaken the foundations of the storied year old german conglomerate mr kutschenreuter and five other suspects were released from custody before christmas after agreeing to cooperate with german prosecutors prosecutors suspect that siemens officials diverted funds through sham consulting contracts to slush funds to bribe potential customers over several years since police raids made the probe public siemens says it has uncovered million euros &# million in suspicious transactions spanning seven years and has ordered an external audit investigators now are trying to determine how far up the corporate ladder the corruption traveled mr kutschenreuter is their star witness if allegations by him and others pan out siemens could find itself barred from bidding for public sector projects in many of the nearly countries in which it is active mr kutschenreuters lawyer declined to discuss the details of the witness statement but said investigators consider his client to be a reliable witness the munich prosecutors office said the investigation is continuing and declined to discuss details of it police are looking into the veracity of mr kutschenreuters allegations siemens suspended mr kutschenreuter after his arrest and says its payments to beit al etisallat were perfectly legitimate siemens says that it is cooperating with authorities and that any wrongdoing was confined to "individual acts" by renegade managers arrest warrants and detailed witness statements by company executives including mr kutschenreuter suggest a different story the statements reviewed by the wall street journal depict a company where payment of bribes was common and highly organized the statements portray top siemens executives as scrambling to escape detection while prosecutors from neighboring countries drew an ever tighter net the allegations come at a difficult time for siemens which manufactures a wide range of products from power turbines and medical scanners to light bulbs ceo mr kleinfeld has been restructuring its far flung operations to narrow the focus and bring up profit margins a plan to merge the bulk of siemenss telecom equipment business the main focus of the criminal investigation into a joint venture with nokia corp has been delayed by the bribery investigation the case also underscores what critics say is german industrys failure to improve corporate governance until germany toughened its corruption laws in companies were actually allowed to write off as expenses bribes paid abroad daimlerchrysler ag is under investigation by the sec and the u s justice department for what the auto maker acknowledges were "improper payments" in africa asia and eastern europe last week siemens was hit with a roughly million euros fine by the european commission for leading a cartel that allegedly fixed prices in the market for electric power switching gear siemens says the fine is unjustified and that it plans to fight the penalty in the potentially more damaging bribery investigation siemens says that while its impossible to keep close watch over every one of its employees it knows of no wrongdoing by members of its current management or supervisory board ceo mr kleinfeld who prosecutors have so far said is only a witness not a suspect says siemens has "zero tolerance" for corruption mr von pierer also says he never engaged in illegal activity mr von pierer gave up the ceo post two years ago to head siemenss supervisory board the highest ranking executive arrested so far is thomas ganswindt a member of the management board until last september german prosecutors have also said that heinz joachim neuburger siemenss chief financial officer until last april is a suspect mr ganswindts lawyer said his client is not guilty a lawyer for mr neuburger declined to comment mr kutschenreuter in the witness statement made after his arrest spread the blame far wider in the beit al etisallat matter he described mr kutschenreuter said that a siemens colleague of his met in london in early with the saudi caller abdul wahab al akeel according to the witness statement the colleague returned to munich with documents detailing bribes by siemens from the late s until early the payments allegedly were made to win contracts with saudi telecom to supply equipment for land line and wireless communications networks the colleague said beit al etisallat would settle for double digit millions of dollars according to mr kutschenreuter who added in his witness statement that he informed messrs kleinfeld neuburger and ganswindt of the situation in writing on april mr kleinfeld then was the senior executive in charge of siemenss telecom business a unit in which mr kutschenreuter then oversaw finances for land line operations siemenss legal department recommended negotiations with beit al etisallat after seeing mr al akeels documents according to mr kutschenreuters witness statement mr kutschenreuter said he then received a call from mr von pierer the ceo at the time asking his opinion he said he told the ceo it would likely cost &# million to settle with beit al etisallat a consulting firm that siemens had dropped in favor of another saudi firm in mr kutschenreuter said that he worked out the details over christmas and the agreement to pay &# million was routed through a saudi arbitration court to formalize it he said he informed siemenss management board of the agreement in january just as mr kleinfeld was about to replace mr von pierer as ceo mr von pierer said in a written response to questions that the settlement wasnt a bribe he said beit did outline &# million in damages a "completely arbitrary" &# million for lost profit up to the year &# million in past due commission claims and &# million for damage to the claimants reputation in january mr von pierer said the sides agreed to settle the matter and certify the payment in a riyadh court a spokesman for mr al akeel and beit al etisallat declined to comment on the siemens negotiations executives at saudi telecom didnt return phone calls seeking comment in a written response mr kleinfeld gave the same version of events as mr von pierer "at no time did mr kutschenreuter mention to me that any hush money was involved in any settlement and at no time did i have any knowledge of documents relating to bribes and still have no such knowledge " he added in his emailed statement mr kutschenreuter years old joined the company in and was posted to algeria in the late s after six years abroad including a stint in iraq he returned to germany in and took up a position in the sales department for telecom contracts in africa and the middle east back at munich headquarters he told prosecutors he learned of an encryption code he alleged was widely used at siemens to itemize bribe payments he said it was derived from the phrase "make profit " with the phrases letters corresponding to the numbers thus with the letter a standing for and p standing for a reference to "file this in the app file" meant a bribe was authorized at of sales a spokesman for siemens said it has no knowledge of a "make profit" encryption system in the mid s mr kutschenreuter worked on financing for power projects in that role he alleged he witnessed bribe payments for power projects in russia and slovakia after moving to siemenss information technology division in mr kutschenreuter said he learned of bribes paid to argentine government officials as siemens competed for a contract to develop electronically scannable passports he said the payments stopped after the argentine government changed hands in late before the contract had been awarded siemens says allegations of bribe payments in russia slovakia and argentina are false a spokesman at the argentine embassy in berlin declined to comment mr kutschenreuter said he was personally involved in lots of bribe payments after becoming finance chief at the land line telecom unit in early though paying bribes abroad was illegal in germany starting in many of his colleagues still saw them merely "as peccadilloes because it was all for the good of the company " he told prosecutors two other former siemens telecom executives have also described alleged bribes in november statements to prosecutors reviewed by the wall street journal reinhard siekaczek and andreas mattes onetime colleagues of mr kutschenreuter also said the bribes were carried out with the knowledge of senior managers prosecutors have presented the three witness statements as evidence in the

wasnt detained mr siekaczek who worked at siemens for four decades said in his witness statement that he was asked to set up slush funds for bribes in or he described a bank account in salzburg austria through which he said more than million euros in bribe funds flowed each year in he alleged mr kutschenreuter warned him to shift funds elsewhere because swiss authorities were following the trail of austrian accounts linked to bribes in nigeria mr siekaczek gave prosecutors a long list of other countries in which he alleged that bribes were paid to win business including egypt cameroon and kazakhstan a lawyer for mr siekaczek who left siemens in declined to comment on specifics but said police have investigated his clients statements and found them reliable mr mattes told prosecutors that a member of the telecom units management board told him in that bribes were commonly paid for securing big telecom projects mr mattes is now an executive at hewlett packard co in the u s after leaving siemens in his lawyer said mr mattes met with investigators in november and stands by his testimony the lawyer said his client is suspected of playing only a minor role in the alleged activity messrs kutschenreuter and siekaczek alleged in their statements that joe kaeser now cfo at siemens was aware of bribes while overseeing the wireless telecom units finances from to mr kutschenreuter also cast blame on two other former wireless executives rudi lamprecht now a member of siemenss management board and lothar pauly who left in to join the management board of deutsche telekom ag siemens said messrs kaeser and lamprecht werent aware of any alleged bribes and did nothing wrong a lawyer for mr pauly said allegations of wrongdoing by his client are false prosecutors say bribes became more elaborate after a tightening of money laundering laws following the sept terrorist attacks and also after investigators in italy switzerland and liechtenstein began circling investigators say siemens lawyers filed briefs to keep prosecutors from accessing bank records in some countries cuno tarfuser a prosecutor in the italian city of bolzano said in an interview that his investigation of austrian accounts was held up for months in and by legal challenges siemens says that at no point did it try to prevent prosecutors from examining company linked accounts siemens said that it has been cooperating with authorities for years a german arrest warrant for mr siekaczek issued last november and reviewed by the wall street journal mapped out how prosecutors suspect bribes were carried out in egypt greece indonesia kuwait saudi arabia and vietnam from to it said that generally after money was routed through at least three layers of secret accounts and shell companies it was entrusted to "bag men" who carried bundles of cash to local "fixers " the fixers then organized the payoffs on behalf of siemens in one case prosecutors said in the arrest warrant mr siekaczek signed a consulting contract in july with austrian firm krhoma gmbh related to a project with saudi telecom according to the arrest warrant siemens paid million euros to krhoma which took a euros commission before wiring the rest to a firm that was based in the british virgin islands and controlled by mr siekaczek a lawyer for krhoma gmbh said krhoma wasnt involved in illegal activity mr

the athens olympics mr kutschenreuter said he informed other senior managers including messrs ganswindt and neuburger of the conversation mr siekaczeks arrest warrant cited million euros in suspicious transfers from siemens to third parties in and alleged they were related to an athens security systems contract a siemens spokeswoman in greece said mr christoforakos "has never mentioned anything to anybody concerning improper payments" related to the olympics she said he has met as a voluntary witness with greek prosecutors who are conducting a preliminary probe of the awarding of a security systems contract she said siemens was a subcontractor and "there is no evidence of any wrongdoing or improper behavior whatsoever " mr kutschenreuter had a busy christmas in in addition to trying to settle the saudi matter he told prosecutors he got a call from mr siekaczek telling him that liechtenstein authorities were investigating certain bank accounts there again mr kutschenreuter alleged senior management was informed siemens later told liechtenstein authorities that the accounts were its own and asked prosecutors to end their investigation according to robert wallner the lead liechtenstein prosecutor the authorities continued to dig at the same time investigators in switzerland italy and austria were tracking separate leads on suspicious transactions flowing through other bank accounts tied to siemens or people acting on its behalf this past november armed with the information more than german police raided about offices and homes of current and former siemens employees they searched offices of management board members including mr kleinfeld the ceo and seized documents german prosecutors are sifting the material and questioning more people in a probe that could stretch for several more months or longer mr kutschenreuter who by the time of his arrest had moved on to siemenss real estate division told prosecutors in december that he would cooperate
