anheusers fruity mixers aim to diversify offerings the belgians love their cherry beers americans like to squeeze lime into their longnecks now anheuser busch cos figures beer lovers are ready for its new fruity beer additives called spykes analysts see it as a baby step by the brewer toward diversifying its beer portfolio spykes is a malt liquor with a alcohol content that can be mixed or taken as a shot and is slightly caffeinated for a kick packaged in ounce bottles spykes comes in such flavors as spicy mango and spicy lime the "spicy" refers to a slight jalapeno like burn on the finish as well as hot melons and hot chocolate chocolate beer its a tad nauseating for some aficionados "hot chocolate is not my thing " said scott clemenson a year old clothing retail manager in st louis where anheuser busch is based but he did favor the spicy lime in his bud light spykes isnt currently sold in st louis but mr clemenson was able to sample it last year on an anheuser busch brewery tour on new years eve he served it to his wife and her friends who liked the lime and melon flavors "they can add it to anything like vodka for a martini mix " mr clemenson said "and the packaging looks neat with the little plastic bottles they can just throw in their purses " one blogger suggested that hot chocolate which anheuser busch recommends for its michelob amber bock would also taste good in a cup of coffee spykes can be mixed with just about anything which was what anheuser busch was after the company wanted a fun product that would resonate with young adults and thought spykes would tie in well with its other brands getting new younger taste buds is crucial because beer makers have been losing market share to distilled spirits for the past five years anheuser busch "is trying to make a play in the distilled spirits arena which appeals to young adults and to women who often do not favor the taste of beer " said benj steinman of beer marketers insights to be sure beer mixers have been tried before but remain a niche product mr steinman said adding spykes isnt going to set revenue on fire instead spykes is likely being used as part of an experiment to learn how drinkers tastes are changing he said "theyre trying to understand whats going on there and what they can do through either growing their own brands or acquiring others " mr steinman said sales of spykes have been increasing slightly each month and they have helped to keep customers eyes on other anheuser busch products said pat mcgauley anheuser buschs vice president of product innovation anheuser busch started test marketing spykes in stores about a year ago and in bars and restaurants within the past four months mr mcgauley said the strategy has been to build the brand slowly by word of mouth on the local retail level first he said "were taking a cautious approach to get market support building the brand within individual distributor accounts " he said salespeople are taking a hands on approach showing retailers which spykes flavor tastes best in which beer and distributing promotional tools that will catch the beer shoppers attention with mixer recipes that approach has carried over into marketing spykes in bars and restaurants where anheuser busch supplies training and displays such as a glowing rotating ferris wheel that holds bottles of spykes in its cars over thanksgiving anheuser busch promoted spykes with a "reunion rail " a box that lines up spykes shooters for four people to drink at the same time when spykes were first marketed about of customers drank them without mixing but that has risen to mr mcgauley said "spykes have done well with all demographics but particularly with college students and tourists " said bryan merrit sales manager for anheuser busch distributor l e lichford inc in lynchburg va "each month for the first four months we couldnt even keep it in stock and we sold a little more each period " mr merrit said "sales have slowed down some now probably due to the season " since midsummer the distributor said it has sold cases of spykes for as much as &# a bottle in addition to retail stores lichford distributes spykes in bars and restaurants that only served beer lessening the competition with mixed drinks such accounts have been particularly successful with spykes such as in florida where liquor licenses are separate from beer and wine mr mcgauley said
