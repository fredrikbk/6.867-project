the daily fix from grange to grossman meet the chicago bears want a capsule history of the nfl just review the saga of the chicago bears the franchise dates back to when they were a company team known as the decatur staleys they won the first true nfl championship game beating the new york giants in and put up the most lopsided score in the history of the nfl shellacking the washington redskins in and the names of famous bears and bits of bearsiana are so hallowed you expect to hear an echo when you say them aloud george halas red grange bronko nagurski gale sayers walter payton mike ditka the monsters of the midway "brians song " the super bowl shuffle and now the bears are back playing the indianapolis colts in super bowl xli can even keeled coach lovie smith and erratic quarterback rex grossman lead them to a second super bowl title and if so can chicagoans hearts make space for them alongside the legendary squad the fix will keep the scouting report brief the bears need their running game keyed by thomas jones and cedric benson to take the pressure off mr grossman giving him the confidence to exploit a vulnerable colts secondary on the flip side the defense led by brian urlacher needs to force mistakes by peyton manning something the bears have done all year ah defense the chicago tribunes don pierson says thats always been the key to bears titles "in before playoffs the bears record of was enough to earn their first title " he writes "that team allowed points less than a touchdown per game in the eight title games theyve won since theyve allowed and points thats an average of less than two touchdowns per game " on offense the tribunes david haugh argues that the super bowl game plan "could fit on one page double spaced run the ball at least times throw deep passes off play action fakes be smart with the football " smart and patient "the bears cannot win if the game comes down to peyton manning making plays " he writes adding that "if the bears dont have rushes in the first half against the colts they are missing the train that carried them to miami " and bears blog windy city gridiron sizes up the game with kerry byrne of cold hard football facts as for their jekyll and hyde qb jay mariotti writes in the chicago sun times that "grossman remains a uniquely complicated subject as perplexing as any to hit a super bowl in recent memory despite the hopeful bravado in chicago that suggests he has overcome his struggles and is ready to have the breakout game of his life sunday lets be honest we still have no idea which rex is going to show up against the colts " in the los angeles times sam farmer tells rexs story warts and all for instance he begins by noting that his father bought no bears jerseys for his clinics employees and sometimes asks that everyone wear them on the same day which sometimes leaves patients asking if theyre all on the same bowling team "those patients should be forgiven " mr farmer cracks "after all even rex grossman has had a hard time this season picking out bears jerseys when he has dropped back to pass " yikes still hold those angry emails mr farmer turns that joke into praise before columns end in the sun times brad biggs checks in with mr urlacher who brushes off talk of what a championship would be like "im still thinking about how to stop no and that running back " the running back in question would be the colts joseph addai a matchup that mr biggs says hasnt gotten enough ink "the popular angle is to match urlacher against manning in the battle of quarterbacks one of the nfcs top defense the other of what has been one of the leagues most potent offenses for almost a decade " he writes "but when you get down to it its more urlacher vs addai its whether the bears can stop the colts running game and make indianapolis one dimensional " devin hester is one of the bears best weapons on special teams hes scored six touchdowns on two kickoffs three punts and a missed field goal the last was a yard return against the giants on nov but his success wasnt instant in the washington post amy shipley writes that mr hester was left in tears after the tennessee titans changed their minds about drafting him one bear whos spent too much time in the spotlight is tank johnson who last month was arrested for the third time in six months this one for weapons violations and then told to stay out of trouble was involved in an altercation hours later that ended with his best friend and bodyguard shot to death in a chicago club mr johnsons punishment a one game suspension in the tribune rick morrissey tells how it went for mr johnson in the glare of media day the bears have shaken off erratic quarterbacking and distractions to get to miami one huge reason is coach lovie smith on espn com wayne drehs takes a trip to mr smiths hometown of big sandy texas "last summer when the local chamber of commerce contacted the bears coach about naming one of the main downtown streets in his honor smith refused insisting the only street that would carry his name would be the yard long glorified bike path that ran in front of the house where he grew up " mr drehs writes "yes it was once on the wrong side of the tracks yes it was down the street from the towns original black elementary school yes its barely wide enough to fit a car the only structures still standing on the street today are a vacated church and a condemned home but lovie smith didnt care " even should they win its doubtful this years bears will ever displace the squad of mcmahon and ditka and payton and dent and singletary and the fridge from the hearts of chicagoans and really we shouldnt be surprised between the hypercaffeinated add of todays sports world and the studied blandness of most of todays athletes its simply harder to bond with a team the way we could two decades ago in the sun times greg couch hopes to move on from da bears not that he doesnt appreciate them "they were great they created every opportunity they now have and no other bears team has gotten in the way in they not only dominated but dominated in a way chicagoans like by kicking butt but this towns clocks stopped years ago and its hard to notice when these guys have reunions because they never went away in the first place " heresy mr couch has a pretty fair defense as for coach ditka hes living the good life as the sun times rick telander discovers "get your mouth shut if you dont think this is the good life " he writes "da coach leans back in his chair at cafe sambal off biscayne bay taking in the sun the warm breeze the potential pleasure of the still sealed ditka brand stogie in his right paw down his gullet has gone a cheeseburger fries a couple of iced teas and lots of fresh ocean air the waitress brings the dessert tray " marion woods prediction bears by two as the tribunes melissa isaacson notes "you dont argue with a year old woman who saw red granges six touchdown day in person holds a pretty strong claim on the distinction of oldest bears fan and makes an awful lot of sense when she talks about rex grossman " tomorrow an all colts daily fix and an ode to peyton manning &amp
