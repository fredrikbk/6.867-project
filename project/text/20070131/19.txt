big chinese miner looks abroad coal producer shenhua could join global hunt for resources beijing ling wen has helped build china shenhua energy co into one of the worlds biggest listed coal companies now he is setting his sights on something even bigger creating a diversified mining concern that could be chinas global challenger to the likes of rio tinto plc or bhp billiton plc "we are very good at coal maybe wed be good at mining other minerals " the year old chief executive said in an interview mr ling who as shenhuas former finance chief shepherded the company through its june listing on the hong kong stock market took over as ceo half a year ago after his predecessor retired mr ling recently traveled to mongolia where shenhua is looking at coal mines it is also considering potential acquisitions in vietnam and australia chinese companies are increasingly joining the global scramble for commodities to feed a hungry economy but unlike the sharp resistance faced by chinese oil companies such as cnooc ltd whose attempt to buy an american oil company was rebuffed coal and commodities companies have an easier time in australia for example chinese companies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in coal and iron mining operations prices for lucrative properties have risen but rising capital costs for starting new mining projects are making mergers and acquisitions a sometimes cheaper alternative to building up assets talks about diversification are at the early stages warns mr ling he says it is still too soon to say when the company could or even if it would shift direction but it is clear that shenhua is looking beyond its borders and beyond coal even as domestic concerns about pollution and energy efficiency pose new challenges since its listing shenhua has benefited from the global commodities boom that pushed up world wide coal prices amid chinas growth j p morgan chase &amp co recently raised its month target price to hong kong dollars &# from hong kong dollars though it warned the stock was "no longer cheap" after rising in three months "theyre definitely the real deal " said andrew driscoll an analyst at clsa asia pacific markets expansion could be funded by a second listing on chinas domestic stock market analysts say the government is keen to have more of its star companies listed amid chinas booming domestic stock market "our goal this year is to focus on internationalization not just through exports " mr ling said shenhuas push into mongolia has been complicated by the mongolian governments wariness of the growing chinese presence there analysts say instead the mongolian government may try to bring in other foreign partners on any deal to curb shenhuas control they say mr ling said chinas drive to increase energy efficiency and encourage consolidation opens up opportunities for shenhua to acquire mining companies with good assets but poor management or technology in a move to reduce the coal industrys high death rate and low efficiency the government has also just announced plans to consolidate the fragmented mining industry into six to eight national giants about workers die annual in chinas coal mines shenhua said its accident rate last year was deaths per million tons of coal a rate comparable to the u s china is the worlds biggest producer and consumer of coal relying on it for more than of its energy needs shenhua is the biggest integrated coal company and accounts for some of chinas annual output this year shenhua hopes to sell million metric tons of coal up from million in when the government created shenhua a decade ago it gave the company chinas biggest coal field which is low in sulfur and relatively easy to mine safely shenhua owns the trains the railroad the port and even power plants in northern china giving it a unique advantage in chinas market and bypassing the logistics bottleneck constraining its domestic competitors for mr ling this vertical integration offers up a chance for more cost control and reducing risk shenhuas revenue grew from billion yuan or &# billion in to billion yuan last year according to nomura international the bank estimates revenue at billion yuan along with its state owned parent shenhua sells more coal than peabody energy corp of the u s shenhuas profits for the first half of last year were billion yuan &# billion up from a year earlier it hasnt released full year numbers yet for the first time this year the government has totally liberalized coal prices shenhua projects its coal prices will rise this year and next a slight discount to spot market prices because of shenhuas sales are one year contracts that build in stability in the bottom line shenhua is the first chinese company to adopt the technology to turn coal into chemicals and fuels known as coal to liquids based on technology developed by germany to make synthetic fuel in the world war ii and further developed by south africas sassol ltd shenhua has its own version to use pressure and heat to turn coal into liquids its state owned parent company is building a plant that could produce the equivalent of barrels a day of diesel jet and other fuels after it starts operation by the end of this year it may be injected into the listed company mr ling said some analysts are skeptical about the ambitions of shenhuas ctl project pointing out that the new facility is some times as large in scale as a current pilot project it also uses a two stop technology that takes coal directly from a solid into a liquid sassol the leader in the field uses the three step technology shenhua claims its method is more energy efficient mr ling says among his goals this year is to implement internal controls designed last year by a t kearney to streamline and standardize decision making one key component of mr lings thinking is the company has to stick to its goal of a internal rate of return for example the company estimates that even if oil falls to &# to &# a barrel they can still reach a rate of return on the ctl project shenhua plans to sell the coal based fuels and also envisions opening its own retail gasoline outlets because of the higher profit margins on selling gasoline mr ling said zhou yang contributed to this article
