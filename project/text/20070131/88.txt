libby trial puts reporters recall to a severe test washington as any reporter knows it is easier to ask questions than answer them special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald is calling several prominent reporters to help bolster the governments case in the perjury trial of lewis "scooter" libby vice president cheneys former chief of staff but the journalists are likely to find themselves the subject of unflattering scrutiny as defense attorneys highlight imprecise and inconsistent recollections and note taking former new york times reporter judith miller who went to jail to avoid spilling mr libbys name to federal investigators was the first of the reporters to appear as a witness in u s district court here yesterday she calmly answered questions from mr fitzgerald describing how mr libby first leaked to her that valerie plame the wife of an administration critic former diplomat joseph wilson worked at the central intelligence agency her testimony initially helped the prosecutions case because she said she received the information from mr libby before the date that he has since said he first learned the information from reporters however she appeared nervous and became confused as william jeffress jr an attorney for mr libby launched into an aggressive series of questions to start his cross examination ms miller who retired from the times in november amid a storm of controversy yesterday gave the jury details of her three meetings with mr libby but mr jeffress noted when she first appeared before the grand jury in late she couldnt remember the first meeting "no " ms miller replied not a thing "no " she repeated then how was it asked mr jeffress leaning into his lectern that she suddenly could recall the meeting "in great detail" ms miller appeared momentarily flustered then gathered herself "not in great detail " she replied adding that she was now merely giving highlights of the meeting as mr jeffress repeatedly sought to bring up ms millers grand jury testimony ms miller became more agitated and said "i dont remember everything that occurred in the grand jury " mr jeffress wouldnt drop his line of questioning and ms miller interrupted him to say she had already told him she couldnt recall all her testimony "do you remember my question " mr jeffress quipped ms miller glared at him during a subsequent bench conference with judge reggie walton ms miller turned to jurors rolling her eyes and shaking her head in frustration mr fitzgerald also guided her through a careful recounting of her note taking which fastidiously used different color pens and brackets to note asides the defense though is trying to zero in on reporters fallibility when they take the stand for instance even though ms miller had several notations of ms plames initials and a misspelling of her name as "valerie flam " she said yesterday she cant recall where the name came from ms millers court testimony ground to a halt nearly an hour ahead of schedule after mr jeffress tried to ask her about other sources besides mr libby with whom she may have discussed mr wilson and his criticism of sthe administration ms millers attorney bob bennett told the court that questions about other sources were off limits and asked for time to confer with ms miller the judge dismissed the jury and agreed to hear arguments about whether to allow the questions mr libbys attorneys were adamant about asking ms miller about other sources mr jeffress told the judge "i think shes going to say she couldnt remember which is very important to her credibility " theodore v wells jr another defense lawyer told the judge it was important to get ms miller to answer the question because it would cast doubt on her testimony "this is classic impeachment " he said the judge said he would consider the matter since leaving the times ms miller has written mainly op ed pieces for publications such as the wall street journal the los angeles times and the new york sun she left the paper in november after internal support for her disintigrated people familiar with the matter say she received a severance package that included a financial component and an agreement from the times that it would allow her to publish a letter in the paper although ms miller agreed not to talk about the terms of the settlement she remained free to talk about her experiences and has made public appearances to discuss her days in jail her support for a federal shield law and freedom of the press ms miller is expected to be followed by matthew cooper formerly a time magazine reporter and tim russert host of nbcs "meet the press " in all of the names listed as possible witnesses in the case are journalists though not all are likely to be called ironically some news organizations had initially urged the white house to launch an investigation to determine who leaked to the media the identity of ms plame as a cia agent shortly after her husband published an opinion article criticizing the bush administrations use of intelligence prior to the iraq war critics of the administration said ms plame was outed as part of a retaliatory campaign to silence a critic instead the investigation turned into a showdown over media rights when prosecutors subpeoned ms miller and mr cooper to reveal their confidential sources the testimony has also pointed to discussions in the white house about leaking or spoonfeeding information to journalists and playing them off against each other with exclusives all of this is now being publicly aired before a washington jury "nobodys going to come out of this looking good " says lucy dalglish executive director of the reporters committee for freedom of the press "people are going to see the reporting process isnt precise the one thing this case has done is reveal how political journalism works in d c and its a lot like a sausage factory " mr libby was indicted on perjury charges in october soon after richard armitage the former deputy secretary of state revealed he was the source of the original leak to syndicated columnist robert novak karl rove president bushs political guru had discussed the case with times mr cooper although he first denied it then amended his testimony neither man nor mr libby has been charged with exposing the identity of an undercover agent in part because it is difficult to prove the disclosures were intentional in the remaining perjury case mr fitzgerald is expecting the reporters to reinforce his charge that mr libby knowingly lied when he told investigators he learned the name of mr wilsons wife from reporters including from mr russert instead prosecutors allege mr libby was already leaking the information and discussing ms plame with reporters and white house officials mr russerts testimony is important because he has said he couldnt have passed the information to mr libby because he didnt know it at the time and only learned about ms plame when he read a piece by mr novak as a well known tv newsman who hosts a popular show mr russert is seen as particularly important for the prosecution and is expected to be highly credible with jurors mr cooper has also contradicted mr libbys statements to investigators in mr coopers case time inc turned over the reporters notes to investigators which mr wells told jurors make no mention of the leak he allegedly got confirmed by mr libby similarly mr wells has suggested that mr russert may be misremembering mr wells told jurors he would explore details of a special deal under which mr russert agreed to give information to investigators this deal mr wells said precluded testimony that mr russert may have learned about ms plame from other nbc reporters it has emerged in court that nbc reporters andrea mitchell and david gregory also learned about the leak and mr wells told jurors if they knew it "then doggone it mr russert probably knew " alternatively mr wells could use mr russerts testimony to show that when mr libby spoke to investigators he may have made a confused reference to mr russert when he meant to name mr novak to whom mr libby also had spoken mr wells told jurors in his opening statement that he wasnt seeking to show that reporters are lying rather he said the reporters like mr libby may simply be misremembering events "tim russert is a great reporter " mr wells said "but hes a human being everybody makes mistakes the question is did someone tell an intentional lie " it isnt clear exactly which reporters beyond messrs cooper and russert will testify washington post reporter bob woodward also has been named as a potential defense witness mr woodward has said he learned ms plames identity from mr armitage the former deputy secretary of state who has emerged as the likely original leaker mr woodward could help mr libbys attorneys make jurors aware of mr armitages role in the case mr fitzgerald knew about mr armitages leak early in the investigation but he wasnt charged the best witnesses for the government have been ari fleischer who was the main white house spokesman from to and catherine martin who worked for vice president dick cheney and remains on the white house communications staff in contrast with ms millers testimony both were unflappable on the witness stand accustomed to staying on message under questioning from reporters the two didnt fumble in describing key meetings and conversations with mr libby joe wilson a former ambassador sent to niger to investigate claims that iraq had tried to buy yellowcake from the country valerie plame joe wilsons wife she is the former cia official whose identity was disclosed in a column by robert novak patrick fitzgerald the u s attorney named special prosecutor to investigate the leak intentionally disclosing the identity of a covert official can be a crime under federal law lewis "scooter" libby vice president cheneys former chief of staff he is charged with perjury in the leak investigation richard armitage former deputy secretary of state who was the original source for the novak column judith miller prosecutors say the former new york times reporter learned but never reported in june about ms plame from mr libby tim russert the host of nbcs "meet the press " mr libby told investigators he learned of ms plame from mr russert the tv newsman denies this bob woodward the veteran washington journalist also learned ms plames identity from mr armitage in mid june matt cooper former time magazine reporter talked to karl rove president bushs top political adviser about ms plame on "double super secret background " karl rove matthew coopers source on valerie plame he initially denied that but later amended the denial and avoided indictment
