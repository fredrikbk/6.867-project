economists react economists find compromise cool hand in fed statement the federal open market committee kept the federal funds rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting and continued to lean toward higher rates should inflation perk up again the feds accompanying statement was more upbeat on both growth and inflation though officials reiterated that "some inflation risks remain " further highlighting that a reduction in interest rates isnt on the feds radar screen economists weigh in on the fed statement and the direction rates may be headed even while most agree no movement is imminent what was most surprising was the rather mild tone the fed took on the prospects of inflation the statement itself reads like a hard fought compromise between two sharply divided factions one side fears that pricing pressures will build fairly soon because of the economys growth momentum and the emerging scarcity of labor and industrial resources the other faction strongly believes inflation remains well contained and unlikely to accelerate anytime soon mix the two views in a brief four paragraph statement and you get a bizarre compromise the fomc statement is supposed to help clarify what the fed is thinking this was one of the rare occasions where it engendered confusion it also means bernanke is going to have some explaining to do when he testifies before congress in two weeks bernard baumohl economic outlook group in a classic line from our favorite movie after bluffing his way to winning a pot during a game of poker cool hand luke explains "sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand " had he been the chairman of the fomc luke would have said "sometimes doing nothing can be a real cool hand" as a means of explaining the decision to keep monetary policy on hold despite what have been wide swings in the tone of economic data and market expectations over the past several months we continue to hold to our view that no changes in the fed funds rate are on tap for the first half of before what we expect to be below trend gdp growth will open the door for two rate cuts over s second half but are increasingly open to the possibility that the fomc could remain on hold for the remainder of richard f moody mission residential fed watchers will spend hours dissecting all of these changes in the fed statement but there is no point in overthinking the fed right now the tweaks at the margin argue for less risk of a move in either direction more growth forestalls the need for easing and less core inflation puts off any need for tightening so the fed is on hold for a while with a slight lean toward hiking whereas the market has the fed on hold for most of the year with a slight lean toward an ease late in the year stephen stanley rbs greenwich capital the fomc continues to have faith in its forecast of modest growth and modestly lower core inflation therefore until something happens that causes the fomc to seriously question this forecast monetary policy would appear to be on hold there is little doubt that recent news on the growth front has been stronger than the fed would like to see on a sustained basis our own view is that unusually warm weather has played a role in boosting activity over the past few months and that the economic data will cool off as weather patterns presumably normalize however until this is borne out in the data the fed and markets will remain concerned about the effect that an upside growth surprise could have on inflation pressures joshua shapiro mfr inc there are substantial changes to the statement though not all are very significant the fed is still treading water nothing will happen until unless there are clear signs of real changes in the labor market ian shepherdson high frequency economics this was a short and sweet statement that inflation is easing and growth is solid in other words the fed almost seemed to be on the verge of declaring victory that declaration made through a rate cut is not likely to come for quite some time inflation is still a concern and the inflation bias remained tight labor markets could put pressure on wages and prices and expectations remain that the economy will slow during the first part of the year but we dont know how much under those circumstances it is likely the fed will do nothing before june naroff economic advisors we see the statement as somewhat hawkish and are unsurprised by the lack of dissent now that richmond fed president lacker has left the ranks of the voters we continue to see no fed rate move in but still argue that the odds of a rate hike are greater than the odds of a rate cut lehman brothers the fed is on hold perhaps for an extended time however recent economic developments appear to have shifted the committees attention so that they are less worried about a sharp slowdown in growth and slightly more worried about a pick up in inflation nevertheless in order to get the fomc to tighten again inflationary pressures and or inflation expectations would have to deteriorate because of the volatility in the monthly data it would also take several months of new data before it would be clear that the committee needed to cut rates so for the time being the fed is on hold steven wood insight economics if gdp growth continues above as we expect and if core inflation pressures show any sign of creeping higher this statement leaves the fed flexibly positioned to raise rates before the middle of the year if january data on employment and retail sales suggest that the economy continued at an above trend pace then bernanke could adopt a more hawkish tone on feb when he delivers his semiannual testimony on monetary policy and the economy to congress our expectations for the feds central tendency forecasts for are to on real gdp growth and to on core pce price inflation bear stearns economics compiled by phil izzo
