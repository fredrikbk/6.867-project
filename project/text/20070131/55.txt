fiscally fit cut cut hike as state lawmakers mull property tax cuts the cullens brace for a home reassessment this week new jersey lawmakers have been making noise about cutting property taxes and its about time since homeowners in my state pay the highest property taxes in the nation lawmakers are considering a bill that would lower property taxes for most new jersey homeowners by as much as and cap annual property tax increases were not getting too excited though its more likely that our property taxes are going to rise rather than fall in the coming years tax break or not we were notified this month that our home is being reassessed as a part of a townwide revaluation thats left me trying to estimate what our new home assessment might be factor in the proposed tax break and figure out the effect on our future tax bills first lets look at the tax breaks today we get a &# tax rebate check under new jerseys fair rebate program checks for senior citizens and homeowners with lower incomes can be as high as &# under one proposed plan the fair program would go away and property tax credits would be offered based on income households earning between &# and &# like ours would get a reduction households with incomes of between &# and &# would get a break and households with incomes of &# or less would get a tax break households with income over &# would get nothing the bill would also cap annual property tax increases at whereas currently they average about there are provisions that would allow higher increases if residents voted to approved them under the new plan our property taxes would be reduced by about &# which would come in the form of a credit on our tax bill thats nowhere near bringing us in line with what homeowners in other states pay in property taxes but its better than getting back just &# and we both like the idea of capping tax increases along with the right to vote on more substantial tax hikes last year my husband gerry and i paid &# in taxes on our square foot three bedroom one and a half bath home for the last five years our taxes have risen an average of &# a year and so ill assume well be looking at another &# increase when our town resets its rate in july thats about average for our state new jersey collected &# per capita in property taxes in according to the most recent figures available from the tax foundation a research group see where your state ranked here combine that likely increase with the proposed tax relief and our taxes would wind up going down about &# still these cuts are merely proposals it remains to be seen how much if any tax relief lawmakers can provide and even if the new jersey measure is passed and we do get a &# credit this year its very likely gerry and i and countless other homeowners in new jersey will see our property taxes jump soon heres why today our home is assessed at &# a figure derived from the last time our town performed a revaluation since then weve seen an unprecedented run up in home values and made some upgrades to our home to be fair these projects would have resulted in an assessment anyway we purchased our home from my father in law for &# in according to the national association of realtors the average home sale price in our area our county falls under new york edison region was &# in the third quarter of to get an idea of our homes current market value i turned to real estate site zillow com which offers its own fair market value estimate based on publicly available information the estimate can also can be customized to reflect upgrades or wear and tear on the home after i plugged in the cost of the mid range kitchen remodel the family room upgrade and the deck patio addition weve completed in the last five years zillow gave me an estimate of &# based on comparable home sales in the area that sounded too high given the relatively soft housing market in my town a search for comparable homes on realtor com showed similar houses selling in the low to mid &# s i called my friend julie a real estate agent in our town to get a feel for conditions on the ground she said &# would be the price shed recommend were we to list it for sale so lets assume after some haggling our home would sell for &# were lucky in the timing of the reassessment as early as mid summer last year comparable homes in my neighborhood were selling for &# or more new jerseys property taxes are based on fair market values my towns general tax rate is calculated by dividing the amount the town needs to meet budget expenses by the total assessed value of all its taxable property then our individual property taxes are calculated by multiplying the tax rate by the assessed value of our home our town has hired an outside home appraisal contractor to perform assessments for our towns general tax rate was or &# per &# in assessed value at an assessed value of &# our taxes would leap to &# a year based on the current tax rate from &# a increase even with our lawmakers new proposed property tax credit our final bill would work out to &# still more than twice the tax were paying now give me a moment while i let these figures sink in ok im back how likely is it well end up paying property taxes in the five figures hard to say the revaluation will result in a sudden surge in our towns total assessed value of taxable property so while our home will be assessed at a higher level the tax rate should come down well be keeping our eye on our towns budget expenses in the coming years to see if the revaluation also results in a sudden surge in spending whatever happens a jump in our property taxes will probably result in a higher whack from the alternative minimum tax property taxes are deductible for federal and state taxes but the amt lessens the tax break the amt was created back in to ensure wealthy taxpayers would pay at least some tax by chipping away at certain deductions including property taxes but the tax wasnt indexed for inflation and in the last few years its been hitting middle income families particularly in high tax states such as california new york and new jersey in the amt hit us for &# up from &# the previous year as much as weve been dreading the coming property tax reassessment were going to make sure the new assessment is fair with one contractor handling such a large townwide revaluation errors are bound to happen according to the homebuilders association of america there are many ways assessments can go wrong including faulty comparisons with other homes in the area incorrect information about the size amenities and condition of the home and simple math errors indeed last year some homeowners outraged by exorbitant assessments went so far as to sue the assessors making sure a home is valued fairly is crucial not just to prevent homeowners from paying more tax than they should but also to ensure that property taxes dont scare off potential home buyers and the chances of winning an appeal are good less than of property taxes are appealed but between and of homeowners who do appeal are successful in lowering their tax bill the hba says in a few states though not new jersey homeowners who appeal are automatically granted a lower assessment if your home is being reassessed check with your towns tax assessor for guidelines on how to appeal before the assessment takes place many towns impose time restrictions on how long you can wait to appeal while others may require expensive documentation that could lessen any benefit youd get from a lower estimate you can find more information on how to appeal a property tax assessment at the hbas web site do you think your property taxes are fair if not how do you think rising property taxes should be contained are local governments doing enough to keep budgets in check write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a discussion about property taxes readers responding to last weeks column about president bushs proposed health insurance tax break either loved the idea or hated it read on to hear some of their views and then join me and your fellow readers in a continuing discussion on health insurance my problem with president bushs proposed health insurance plan is that i have grave doubts as to whether he or anyone else who worked on the plan has ever had to apply and get their own private health insurance if they had they would know how difficult it is to a get a policy b keep the policy and c have claims paid l j kutten the fact is that americas are engaging in health "financing " not insuring insurance was instituted to cover those costs that one cannot afford to cover oneself employers have been sold health insurance packages that have spoiled employees we all expect to have a &# or &# co pay for a doctor visit no matter how trivial the ailment now that were used to services for cheap while the employer carries more and more of a burden we need to wean ourselves off of the too frequent and really unnecessary office visits because of a low co pay gail parker the true reality is that the more we segment the pooling of all of our risk as we purchase health insurance one at a time the more we will make health insurance unaffordable for the chronically ill the aging and those with predisposition of illness healthy people like to think that those who are not healthy somehow bring it on themselves but that defies the biological lottery of disease how much better it would be to have a rational system that supports the healthy as well as the sick through a combination of compassion and price sensitive mechanisms that dissuade us from overspending and promotes the allocation of health services based on evidence science and patient preferences carolyn engelhard my view is that of a retiree who must pay for the total cost of his health insurance out of retirement income why do i have to pay for it with post tax dollars when people with employer paid health insurance dont pay any taxes on this benefit charles l rachor i concur with your point that lower income families see little incentive in the short term to purchase high deductible health insurance i too come from a low income family and the short term vision in so many of these families wont allow them to "buy in" to the administrations plan if the plan could be tweaked to allow these families immediate gratification in the form of a cafeteria plan that would compensate the families for their expenses or allow the insurance provider to be compensated directly by the employer or the government with the tax dollars saved then the plans chance of success would increase gary d wavra just the fact that you a personal finance columnist had "no idea what your health care premiums cost" and thinking through the consequences of this tax proposal made you more aware of the costs and tradeoffs of health care coverage shows why this health care policy is necessary changes such as these will make everyone more aware of the cost of health care and begin a thought process about what amount of health care is the right amount it is a necessary part of a comprehensive health care solution dr craig
