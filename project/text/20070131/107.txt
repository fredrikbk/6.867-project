pentagons covert activities come under senate scrutiny congresss new democratic majority is expanding its review of the bush administrations push for broad executive power as the senate is set to look into how the pentagon has increased its covert intelligence operations lawmakers plan to study whether the pentagon obtained the proper authorization for covert operations and notified congress as required under the law the inquiry will also explore whether the pentagon engaged in activities that legally are the responsibility of the central intelligence agency the hearings to be conducted by the senate intelligence committee beginning march stem from concerns of some lawmakers particularly democrats about an expansion of defense department intelligence actions under former secretary donald rumsfeld critics have said the effort amounts to building a parallel intelligence network that competes with the cia but without the broader oversight under which the cia operates republican congressional leaders had overruled previous efforts by some lawmakers to investigate the expansion but they lost control of congress this month sen jay rockefeller d w va the panels new chairman has supported such a review and scheduled the hearing while the hearings will focus on military covert activity abroad congressional democrats and some republicans also are interested in domestic intelligence activities launched by the pentagon and other federal agencies since the sept terror attacks the new activities include data mining and domestic warrantless wiretapping critics say they threaten privacy and civil liberties the senate judiciary committee under its new chairman patrick leahy d vt held two hearings this month on these activities people involved with the intelligence panels plans said the hearing witnesses likely will include new defense secretary robert gates mr rumsfeld cited the post terrorist threat as justification for broadening defense intelligence activities the pentagon established a counterintelligence field activity unit which has been criticized for collecting data on u s citizens it also created undercover teams from the defense intelligence agency and military special operations forces to conduct operations overseas so far however the pentagon appears to have been able to conduct those operations without the formal steps required of other u s intelligence agencies before covert action traditionally covert actions overseas have been the task of the cia they entail activities such as secret attempts to capture or kill suspected terrorists and propaganda campaigns one question to be explored during the hearings will be whether the pentagons secret operations may have violated a federal law that requires a written presidential finding and notification of the congressional intelligence committees when a covert action is to be carried out a november report by congressional researchers concluded that there was reason to question whether the pentagon was trying to evade the requirements of the law that law was adopted in response to congressional concerns about the iran contra affair in the mid s when the reagan administration secretly sold arms to iran and used the proceeds to fund an anticommunist nicaraguan insurgency the changes strengthened requirements for presidential findings and notification of the intelligence committees under mr rumsfeld the pentagon contended that its new activities dont fall under the laws definition of "covert actions " instead as the congressional research service report notes it claimed exemption from the requirements because it said the new secret operations carried out by military personnel in afghanistan iraq and elsewhere amount to traditional military activities intended to help prepare for battle the law added in as a new section of the national security act of defines covert activity as action by the u s government "to influence political economic or military conditions abroad where it is intended that the role of the united states government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly " except under unusual circumstances the law requires the president to sign a finding beforehand to authorize a covert action attesting that it supports specific foreign policy goals and is important to national security former army lt gen william odom now at the hudson institute said oversight is important partly because such operations easily can go awry causing unintended results and diplomatic embarrassment for the u s "rumsfeld just ran loose " he said adding "you have to have a system where you hold people accountable for making the decisions " mr rumsfeld has said the expanded intelligence activities by the pentagon were vital to the global war on terrorism gen odom also noted recent complaints from cia officials that covert actions were taking place in countries where local cia station chiefs knew nothing about them the pentagons press office didnt respond to repeated requests for comment
