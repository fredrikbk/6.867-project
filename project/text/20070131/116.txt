infrastructure and because of punitive regulations little that resembled a formal economy there were no office buildings or shopping malls and sowetos merchants sold everything from produce to hardware from their homes or small storefronts blacks generally werent allowed to drink under apartheid era laws so soweto bars were discreet backroom affairs known as shebeens when apartheid started to crumble in the early s many upwardly mobile blacks seized the opportunity to move to wealthy white neighborhoods mainly in the northern areas of johannesburg but many south african blacks quickly
