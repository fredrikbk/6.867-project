me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q we live in a hilly area and my husband who drives a lexus rx insists on shifting into neutral coasting downhill he believes he is saving on fuel im concerned he doesnt have control of the car in neutral and this may be a safety issue your thoughts s weiman greenwich conn a i think the facts are on your side for starters modern electronic fuel injection systems cut off the fuel supply when the driver isnt pressing the throttle so coasting with ones foot off the gas pedal will save as much fuel as shifting to neutral you also are correct that driving in neutral results in slightly less control keeping the vehicle in gear enables the engines compression to act as a brake helping to slow it on steep descents and easing the strain on the brakes also if an emergency arises in which you need to accelerate quickly it is best to keep the car in drive i can think of no advantage to coasting downhill in neutral but many disadvantages q the dvd player in my ford explorer wont work and the dealer quoted replacement or repair cost of more than &# this machine has already been replaced once under warranty this seems like a rip off are there any reasonably priced alternatives steve elerding prosser wash a i havent heard that the explorers dvd entertainment system is especially problem prone but while recently test driving an explorer i thought its dvd player seemed to have been tacked onto the ceiling as an afterthought a low hanging afterthought on which i repeatedly bumped my head i think drivers are often better off buying aftermarket portable dvd players and satellite navigation systems they cost less than factory installed systems and can be moved easily from one vehicle to another or used while camping though it defeats the purpose of camping there are many styles of portable systems available so it pays to shop around q i am curious why volvo doesnt offer a pickup in the u s it seems odd because they sell an suv and are a leader in commercial trucks toyota and honda offer pickups that seem to be doing well against ford and gm david hines dallas a volvo built pickup trucks decades ago but stopped the company says in the late s production was limited and the trucks are a rare find today the swedish car maker has periodically considered building a modern pickup but hasnt considering how small the market for the vehicle probably would be questions can be e mailed to mecar wsj com
