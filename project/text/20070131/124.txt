the daily fix ode to the bears special to the wall street journal the daily fix asked readers who are fans of the bears and colts to write an ode to their club explaining why they root for them and what characteristics their team seems to have year in and year out even as the cast of characters changes heres jeff katz on the chicago bears im a native chicagoan born within spitting distance of soldier field of course in those days the bears played at wrigley field where my grandfather had season tickets he purchased in the early fifties from mr halas himself my father took me to my first bears game in a rookie named sayers had the moves of a comic book superhero and i was hooked ive been a die hard fan through it all dyche stadium abe gibron bobby douglass sweetness super bowl shuffle i lived in texas when the bears last played in the super bowl so my favorite game from the magical season was the victory over the cowboys in dallas no one at the office bothered me about being a bears fan after that and now were back ive been back in chicago for a while and the bears are back in the super bowl im back because of family and those deep chicago roots that dont let go the season tickets are long gone victim of prodigal sons like me but the nfls dominant position in sports programming assures i can follow my team wherever life takes me and allows me to introduce the next generation of bear fans to their home town team and i married well attending quite a few games in my father in laws seats the bears theyre back through old fashioned blue collar hard work defense and a steady hand at the helm team effort not star power year in year out the bears play a brand of hard nosed football that would make george halas proud its a great fit with the city of big shoulders defense wins championships defense can change momentum by taking away the ball this bears defensive unit reflects the same commitment to superiority as the legendary defensive units of the last two bears championships in and the loss of tommie harris and mike brown leaves this bear defense less dominating than it was during the first half of the season but as they showed against the nfls top offense in the seasons penultimate game they remain as formidable as any group in the league brian urlacher is the quintessential link to the past continuing the tradition at middle linebacker established by bill george and taken to new levels by dick butkus and mike singletary all fit the same mold hard hitters who move well particularly sideline to sideline known for their smarts as well as their smacks they call the defenses they lead the defenses and they love the game along with his leadership of the secondary and his "nose for the ball " what the team misses in mike brown is that hard hitting safety who can stop the run doug plank was the rough cut original and the reason it was called the " defense" with gary fencik and dave duerson the more refined versions on the champs now chris harris and todd johnson are filling the big shoes of mike brown and history we need their best on sunday in bears history even the "skill" players on offense payton ditka mcmahon not to mention early greats like nagurski have been hard nosed thomas jones is less elusive than he was at virginia but a much tougher and more durable runner cedric benson has been coming on showing the talent and determination the team has needed from him down the stretch like mr ditka before him tight end desmond clark delivers hole opening blocks and makes the big catch the offensive line is solid at every position with the same approach and attitude toward getting the job done that permeates chicago the joke in was that the defense would come off the field and tell the offense to "hold em " west coast offense need not apply well take three yards and a cloud of dust the city didnt waste its money on a domed stadium we like the wind off the lake in december just fine no fan complains that rex grossman isnt tough enough weve seen him take the big hits and bounce up ready to throw a missile to muhammad or a bomb to berrian the problem is that mr grossman gives up the ball too much putting the defense in a bind thats sacrilege on the north side south side west side in the suburbs and collar counties head coach lovie smith brings it all together his even keeled demeanor on the sideline is just what his players need he is a rock when all around him is bedlam his team is disciplined but passionate the nfc championship game was a perfect example of how he coaches and how his team plays underneath the calm exterior he wants to win as much as anyone but the best way for him to achieve victory is to stay cool in lovie smith the bears have a coach who could assure excellence for years to come job one is for mr smith and the team to win the super bowl job two is for mr phillips and mr angelo to re sign mr smith so heres to da bears monsters of the midway successors to the staleys as with their other wins this year theyll have to go out and earn this one without benefit of snow its time for the bears to wrap their claws around another lombardi trophy and time for their fans to roar with them in victory jeff katz is an insurance executive who splits his time between offices in chicago and atlanta he and his family will be among the billions watching super bowl xli on television write to him at jeffk comcast net
