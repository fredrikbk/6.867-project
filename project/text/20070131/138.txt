the struggle to cash out venture capitalists must work to pull profits from investments venture capitalists are reaching into a new bag of tricks to cash out of their investments for the past few years it has been difficult for venture capitalists to cash in on their investments in start up companies historically they drew out their profits in the start up businesses they financed by doing public stock offerings or outright sales of the companies it isnt so easy anymore despite a recent burst of activity the pace of new stock offerings remains muted compared with the late s and and acquisitions of start up companies while steady havent skyrocketed that has left venture capitalists with many companies they funded sitting in their portfolios generating no returns so some venture financiers have started selling off partial stakes in their start up businesses to private equity firms which generally buy and sell more mature businesses often buying out publicly traded companies others are selling their investments to so called secondary investors who specialize in buying assets from the venture community still other venture capitalists are using their clout to pressure the boards of companies they have invested in to issue them cash dividends as a form of return some venture capitalists are going as far as asking start up executives to buy them out altogether venture financiers typically have clout with the companies they invest in but they must get the board to agree "theres a shift going on " says tom crotty a venture capitalist at battery ventures which has offices in waltham mass and menlo park calif "we have to think more creatively " battery recently decided to use some of an &# million venture fund that was closed to new investors in to invest in companies that would generate returns not through an ipo or sale but by issuing dividends a first for battery battery in invested &# million in mademanage systems inc part of a &# million buyout of the company that also included debt the indianapolis software company soon paid two cash dividends to battery totaling &# million when mademanage took on &# million of new debt in it used some of the cash to pay off loans and battery got another &# million payout in late battery sold nearly half its stake to private equity firm thoma cressey equity partners that deal which involved mademanage taking on more debt produced &# million in profit for battery the upshot just years after investing in mademanage the company had generated nearly &# million for battery more than five times what the firm had originally invested and it still owns a stake "when we embarked on the mademanage project the ipo market was nonexistent and the mergers and acquisition market was pretty dormant " says dave tabors a battery partner who oversaw the investment "it was a very conscious decision to seek returns differently fortunately the math worked " the pressure on venture capitalists to creatively translate their investments into profit these days is intense because venture funds typically are structured to generate returns over years those who invested in the late s are eager for a payout u s venture funds launched in have delivered a median loss of and those launched in have had a median loss of according to research firm cambridge associates in contrast u s venture funds started in benefited from selling companies and taking start ups public in the go go years of and producing median returns of more than says cambridge drew lanza a general partner at morgenthaler ventures in menlo park says the firm has taken dividends from one of its start up businesses and adds that he is talking with two others about having them buy out the firms stake for five to times its original investment "historically i wouldnt do something like this because i could do better via an ipo " mr lanza says "were truly feeling our way at this point " the buildup of start up companies in venture capitalists portfolios has proven to be a boon for private equity firms and secondary investors including saints ventures of san francisco and w capital partners of new york both buy stakes in companies that the venture financiers no longer have the patience to own often for less than the original backers might have wanted ken sawyer a managing director at saints says he positions his firm
