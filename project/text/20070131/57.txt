from toxic wasteland to public garden with view olympic sculpture park now open to the public free admission seattle a rotting log a train whistle a giant runaway eraser those seemingly unrelated items astonishingly enough are core elements of the olympic sculpture park a wildly successful new public sculpture garden developed by the seattle art museum at the edge of downtown seattle on the unlikeliest of sites two small industrial lots and a parking lot separated by a busy street and an even busier railway line the &# million nine acre park now links visitors to seattles dramatic views its downtown and its waterfront in a way not accomplished in any meaningful way during the citys year plus history and its all free to see a photo of the sites original state is to understand what an imaginative design the new york based firm of weiss manfredi architecture landscape urbanism came up with the park actually started out as not one site but three small parcels split from one another by elliott avenue a busy waterfront street and a burlington northern railway that serves the nearby port of seattle not only was the site of the proposed park divided into pieces it largely was two dimensional the disparate lots graded level although together they stepped down feet to saltwater elliott bay at their western perimeter the obvious solution would have been to cap the streets and rail lines with a giant lid instead weiss manfredi kept the main pieces of the site distinct linking them with a foot long connecting path shaped like a huge "z " a solution marion weiss who with husband michael manfredi forms the core of weiss manfredi modeled origami like one day with a torn business card it was an inspiration she said during a frigid january press preview that came "after a few margaritas and hours of research " in addition the architects completely reshaped the parks topography using more than cubic yards of fill conveniently the seattle art museum was excavating for a major expansion of its downtown facility a project that yielded much of it weiss manfredi created valleys ridges and hillsides that in miniature mimic the rugged terrain of the pacific northwest as a bonus the imported soil sealed off a toxic stew of industrial waste now from the parks visitor center a path descends to a wooded valley then climbs a ridge that leads to a walkway over elliott avenue views of glacier topped foot mount rainier miles to the southeast and of the jagged olympic mountains miles to the west across elliott bay compel a visitor to stop the route trends down again through a grove of quaking aspen then up and across another bridge over the railway from which the wonderful doppler fading sounds of a train whistle frequently emerge finally the path descends to a rocky shoreline and the water over it all looms seattles downtown core of story glass and granite office towers the overall effect is so spectacular between the mountains the water and the seattle skyline that art could take second billing but it holds its own in the "valley " for instance richard serras massive "wake" consists of five enormous rippling pillars of curved rusting steel set on a bed of billiard table flat crushed rock that seem to swim through the air like flat topped shark fins "wakes"s great appeal is in the way it appears to change when one walks between or around the giant steel slabs west toward the bay sited as to ensure maximum appearance in a billion tourists photos perches alexander calders "eagle" painted orange and nearly feet tall "eagle" stands on four feet but its flowing lines and arching peak do indeed make it ready to fly other notable works include roxy paines "split" a foot tree of polished stainless steel that is set well apart from the nearest real trees whose forms nonetheless provide a foil for "split"s silvery lines tony smiths "stinger" developed in built in set within the aspen grove consists of black painted steel boxes shaped into tetrahedrals and octahedrals laid out in a square pattern the boxes embrace a visitor walking through an entryway that breaks up the square teresita fernandezs "seattle cloud cover" creates a luminous panel of cloud like patterns set into a glass sandwich that traverses the length of the railway bridge and theres a requisite fountain in the form of "father and son" by french american sculptor louise bourgeois in which the forms of a parent and child are alternately engulfed in water for charm though its hard to beat claes oldenburg and coosje van bruggens foot tall "typewriter eraser scale x" its orange wheel careering down one of the parks hillsides toward elliott avenue blue brush flailing its hilarious in part because most viewers under the age of wont have the faintest idea what it is then theres the rotting log in this case a "nurse log" a foot western hemlock that toppled over in a forest south of seattle in and quickly began to decay and sprout ferns mushrooms and lichens artist mark dion whose work attempts to show how we understand or misunderstand the natural world had the log transported to the olympic sculpture park and installed in the neukom vivarium there inside an foot long greenhouse with elaborate screens misters and ventilators to keep the log "alive" visitors will over the years see firsthand a natural process occurring in few places anywhere else in seattle problems with the park a few mainly its swaths of grass look great but for most of the year they will offer few dry places to sit and enjoy the views more knee high concrete benches or shelves would be welcome and compared with the stoic dignity of "eagle" or "wave " ms bourgeoiss sopping parent and child are frankly corny otherwise the olympic sculpture park is a revelation one particularly impressive in light of seattles generally dismal record of quickly creating public spaces uncompromised by the city council and chamber of commerce microsoft money seems to have steamrollered the usual seattle fuss budgeting and helped snatch the site from developers desperate for waterfront views former microsoft president and coo jon shirley spearheaded the park and endowed its operating funds while the bill &amp melinda gates foundation microsoft co founder paul allen and former microsoft legal chief william neukom all donated generously they werent alone some donors helped finance the project from the looks of it it was all to the public good mr gantenbein is a writer based in port townsend wash
