the evening wrap price patrol federal reserve chairman ben bernanke closed out his first year on the job in much the same fashion that he started it scanning the horizon for signs of inflation and vowing to steer by the data first and most anticlimactically the central bank left its key federal funds rate parked at the level it has been at ever since the fed last summer ended its two year streak of rate increases markets knew that rates would be going nowhere and investors were keenly focused on just how policy makers would change their closely parsed statement in an acknowledgement of todays hot reading on economic growth gross domestic product expanded at a annual rate in the fourth quarter a pleasing robust reading after a soggy six month patch that saw growth slow to closer to the committee said that recent data "suggested somewhat firmer economic growth" and even "tentative signs of stabilization" in the housing market just a few months ago forecasters were moping around like debbie downer wringing their hands with worry that the homes market would sweep the economys legs out from underneath it but the central bank like a number of economists who had issues with the growth data today doesnt think the economy is poised for a boom it said overall "the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters " in the meantime the central bank is still dogging inflation when the economic numbers were coming in a good deal flabbier early in the last quarter a number of commentators howled that the fed should start cutting rates soon inflation numbers in the gdp report looked pretty soft measure of core inflation which excludes food and energy costs climbed in annual terms that was slower than the year over year growth seen in the third quarter soft readings like that might normally bolster the case for a rate reduction but with the expansion on relatively sound footing mr bernanke and company made nary a nod in the direction of trimming rates while noting that core prices had "improved modestly in recent months " they made it clear they think some inflation risks are still lingering around the bend and "the extent and timing of any additional firming" thats firming as in not easing slackening loosening relaxing kicking back laying down or any other synonym one might conjure for taking a hatchet to rates will be as ever dependent on the incoming data economists said the fed thus appears to be in a holding pattern and likely for an extended period of time steven wood of insight economics wrote in a note that it would take months of worse than expected inflation reports before the fed would be motivated to begin increasing rates by the same logic it would take a long string of sorry looking numbers on the growth front before the fed would move rates lower stock markets seemed to be delighted with the notion that the fed might find itself with nothing to do for a good long time markets were mostly running in circles
