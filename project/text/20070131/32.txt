corporate focus business private equitys successes stir up a backlash that may be misdirected the annual world economic forum in davos is like a junior high school for the global elite its nonstop parties urgent hallway encounters and sporadic classroom discussions reflect the pecking order of world power six years ago internet entrepreneurs ruled the roost in the swiss alpine resort this year private equity financiers stephen schwarzman of blackstone group david rubenstein of carlyle group and glenn hutchins of silver lake partners were the big dogs it is also clear however that a private equity backlash is brewing european trade union leaders used the global confab to attack what they called the "buy it strip it flip it" mentality of private equity firms malcolm knight an international bank regulator called for "more transparency" for hedge funds and private equity alike even mr rubenstein acknowledged he and his colleagues have done "an awful job" presenting themselves to the public "we dont talk about blue collar workers " he said and instead "brag about how much money we have made " the most important backlash though may be one taking place far from davos among shareholders and directors of target companies some large shareholders of clear channel communications for instance now say they wont vote for a management led buyout of that company even though it offers them a premium to the stock price on the day it was announced similarly a committee of independent directors shot down a management led buyout of cablevision systems despite a premium of the cablevision showdown in particular marks a turning point for private equity the dolan family runs the bethpage n y cable company and owns of its shares but the company has a dual share structure that gives family members of the voting rights the family in other words is used to getting its way the fact that independent board members were willing to reject the buyout plan shows just how serious the backlash has become increasingly shareholders and directors are asking a fundamental question if managers can create so much wealth for private owners why cant they do the same for public shareholders christobal conde chief executive officer of software company sungard data systems thinks he has an answer to that question he was also in davos last week and happy to tell his story to anyone who asked as a public company ceo he was skeptical when silver lakes mr hutchins first approached him two years ago about leading a buyout of his company he thought private equity firms made their money mostly through financial engineering loading the target company with debt but since then he has learned otherwise the buyout he says made sungard a better company first "it allowed us to push an enormous amount of change through the organization " mr conde says "it made everyone more receptive " that is particularly true of top managers who were given twice the ownership stake in the company that they had when it was public by boosting the companys debt the buyout also ensured the value of those ownership stakes would skyrocket if the managers met their goals second he says his new private equity partners which include silver lake blackstone bain capital goldman sachs group kohlberg kravis roberts providence equity and texas pacific group have taught the company a great deal about improving the business in areas like purchasing "like any company we were very inbred " mr conde says but the private equity partners operate across companies and industries and were able to bring new knowledge to the firm "that has helped us enormously " finally he says his private equity partners arent obsessed with quarterly earnings they understand a companys earnings may be volatile and instead they focus on longer term goals "i spend more time with my new private equity shareholders than i did with the old ones " he says "but i get so much more out of it " mr conde says sungard is still owned by many of the same pension funds that owned it before that is the ultimate irony behind the new financial alchemy pension funds are paying hefty fees to private equity firms which generally charge of funds under management plus of the profit to make investments that the pension funds used to make by themselves shareholders are right to be concerned about this trend but the fault lies less with a private equity market that is generating superior returns than with a public company market that is generating lousy ones investors would be better off if public companies could clean up their own houses and get rid of the high priced middleman alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
