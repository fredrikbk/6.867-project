a health care bargain three years ago this month insurance companies began offering americans a new type of medical coverage health savings accounts which marry low cost high deductible health insurance policies with pre tax accounts to pay for day to day health care but the anniversary is muted a slew of reports have been critical dismissing consumer driven health care as unpopular and harmful and with the democrats in control of congress washingtons enthusiasm for the concept has cooled nevertheless the republicans should take credit where due the white house ought to build on the growing success of hsas which are integral to the presidents vision of "affordable and available" health care an executive of an upstart airline recently described her company as having three s more than employees and one big headache rising health care costs thus they made the switch to hsas in and premiums rose just compared with a national average of over such successes arent making the news but overwhelmingly negative stories are a much reported commonwealth fund survey for example concluded that enrollment in consumer driven plans is stagnant people are grossly dissatisfied and care is delayed but the report was flawed on its face for one it was unrepresentative drawn from a pool of "internet users who have agreed to participate in research surveys " heres the untold story despite recent entry into the market these plans are gaining popularity drawing on information from major insurance carriers william boyles publisher of the consumer driven market report estimates that enrollment in hsa type plans or hras a forerunner to health savings accounts more than doubled since january to million americans the estimate is plausible as last year twice as many employers offered this coverage than in and the number of financial institutions supporting hsas tripled early data suggest good results following a year long analysis of consumer driven health care members cigna reports that costs are lower than for enrollees in traditional plans but the use of medications for chronic conditions increased enrollees in aetnas consumer directed healthfund maintain their health even if chronically ill and purchase more preventative services yet medical costs rose just in hra based plans between and a kaiser family foundation survey finds of those with the new "consumer directed health plans" consider cost when seeking health care compared with of those with more traditional employer sponsored coverage granted not everyone is satisfied half of the kaiser respondents for example want to switch to a traditional plan reservations arent surprising hsas can seem initially complicated eos the upstart airline held townhall meetings and offered health coaches to smooth the transition looking back on gop era capitol hill welfare reform stands out as the greatest achievement health savings accounts may eventually be considered a close second if hsas can help tame health inflation the timing couldnt be more critical according to hhs projections without significant changes national health spending will double to about &# trillion by democrats have their own agenda the house has already voted to change medicares prescription drug benefit so that the federal government can "negotiate" prices they also want to expand schip the clinton administrations state health program for children as the minority party the gop may be tempted to go on the defensive opposing democratic ideas as they did with hillarycare or aiming to temper them their strategy for schip but instead republicans should espouse a positive agenda regardless of whether all its elements can be passed including the improvement and expansion of hsas one improvement is to loosen the mandated structure of the hsa employers have no flexibility for instance to decide what the deductible covers thus lumping diabetic supplies and viagra into one cost category another improvement would allow individuals to make larger annual deposits into hsas as president bush has championed so too would be in line with the state of the union health care proposals a leveling of the tax playing field allowing individuals to purchase hsas with the same tax preference as employers while many democrats loathe hsas it is still possible that hsas can be improved and expanded if tactical opportunities arise remember ronald reagan got his tax cut even though many democrats loathed that too republicans could also urge more state experimentation members from both parties sens jeff bingaman and george voinovich along with reps tammy baldwin tom price and john tierney recently proposed legislation to create a super commission charged with receiving reform ideas from states and then making grants to enable them the white house has a bargaining chip here without action schip will expire and it might be possible to meet the democrats half way they could extend schip in states that are interested while other states would have greater freedom to experiment with market reforms such as expanded hsas and that could help make the fourth anniversary of hsas even more significant mr gratzer a physician and a senior fellow at the manhattan institute is the author of "the cure how capitalism can save american health care" encounter see related letter "letters to the editor cost savings ensure hsas steady growth" wsj feb
