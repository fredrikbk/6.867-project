journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources health care expansion of medicare medicaid better serves the liberal agenda liberals are mistaken in trying to achieve universal health coverage by compromising on how it is structured says matthew yglesias in the left leaning journal since political realities call for compromise liberals should negotiate over the number of people covered not on the way they are covered or they risk locking a bad system in place forever in mr yglesiass ideal world all americans would have an "identical taxpayer financed

recent approach a law that essentially co opts private insurance plans buying insurance is mandatory but most employers are required to offer coverage mr yglesias says this sort of program offers

negotiate for an age under which everyone would be eligible for medicaid which covers the poor and for a younger age at which everyone would qualify for medicare which covers the elderly the number of people covered should be increased every year this has another pragmatic advantage mr yglesias says it creates a situation where liberals are making a promises on which they can deliver instead of

though the only way to know this was through information given to the subjects that the readers didnt have the authors of the study which was published in the journal psychological science concluded
