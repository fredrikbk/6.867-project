business world future of driving the future will be a grim and joyless place but at least the traffic will move smoothly our lord and master will be anpr or automatic number plate recognition you may want to stop reading now if you have a history of depression or speeding tickets anpr exists today in u s cities in the form of "red light cameras" violate a stop light and a camera snaps your picture and sends you a ticket in the mail these cameras are now being joined by "speed cameras " though not without bleats of voter resistance in ohio arizona and elsewhere britain leads the world in consigning itself to the rule of anpr tony blairs government will complete the task this year of networking the countrys traffic cameras and interlacing them with thousands of anti crime cameras focused on downtown areas parking lots and even private commercial premises virtually every journey taken by car in the united kingdom will be tracked a record will be kept for up to five years with traffic safety in hand the aim next is to "deny criminals use of the roads " or so claims the british police chiefs association cynical brits or perhaps just those who are awake suspect another motive is money the mail on sunday a tabloid sent reporters to visit the head of a leading speed camera company posing as buyers for an eastern european government the executive gleefully informed them "the beauty of the mobile units we sell is their flexibility they will catch businessmen going into work in the morning and school run mums in the afternoon the money will come in in buckets " mayor anthony williams of washington d c credits his citys traffic cameras with making the city safer he also acknowledges that the cameras are helping balance the citys budget since d c began installing them five years ago the annual take has grown to about &# million but if traffic is slower and safer why does the haul keep growing good question in a systematic review the washington post found that accidents had actually increased at the targeted intersections compared to intersections without cameras one likely reason is drivers stomping on their brakes when they observe the presence of a camera prompting a surge in rear end collisions critics also notice the incentive for operators to shorten the duration of yellow lights to ring up more fines in fact the best solution for an intersection with excessive red light running is usually a longer yellow not a camera the mid atlantic chapter of the aaa originally endorsed d c s cameras the organization is now a dissenter accusing the city with targeting maryland commuters on new york avenue and other thoroughfares used by out of towners in one recent month marylanders paid of the tickets some critics have also leveled accusations that the city has placed cameras at the bottom of hills robert ehrlich until this year the republican governor of maryland vetoed a plan by his own states legislature to introduce a network of traffic cameras he pointed out that theres "no data to support the notion that speed cameras will reduce accidents" and he worried about the fate of due process when citizens are accused by a digital device cincinnati mayor charlie luken two years ago vetoed a similar initiative by his city council saying "i appreciate the comments about safety but lets be honest with the public we didnt think about this until we came up with a budget problem " whether the british approach which aims to use comprehensive vehicle surveillance to battle crime succeeds will be an experiment to watch britains system allows license plate data to be instantly matched with insurance data and registration data since crooks tend to be lax about such matters police say that pulling over cars flagged for paperwork violations is a good way to interrupt criminals going about their business the system also makes it easy to track down a car spotted at a crime scene if a witness has properly noted the plate number these virtues notwithstanding the lesson of incentives strongly indicates that the motive likely to predominate over time is the financial one in britain cameras originally installed on downtown streets and parking lots for anti mugging purposes have now been given plate reading capability as a result britons are increasingly being surprised by tickets in the mail for making illegal u turns or dropping passengers in no loading zones even in lonely hours when no one is around to notice or care ka ching the technology may yet deliver a crime free britain or at least a britain where criminals travel on foot or maybe it will just deliver a britain where criminals invent new crimes one innovation already is "car cloning" thieves nab a car of the same color make and model as a legally registered vehicle say yours they steal the tag or counterfeit it bingo you are dunned in the mail for traffic fines from places youve never been given the relentless appetite of technology to advance and make itself useful these are just inklings of challenges to come surveillance cameras have already been outfitted with face recognition capability in some jurisdictions the u s federal government recently postponed an urge to make "black boxes" mandatory in cars but dont doubt that all vehicles will someday have data recorders on board possibly programmed to alert authorities when we speed or emit too many pollutants it doesnt help that traffic laws in many jurisdictions were never designed for the real world posted speed limits frequently bear no relation to the speeds that traffic actually travels and safely worse under lord anpr citizens are excused from regulating their own behavior in one of the chief realms where on a daily basis we encounter the law in both practical and theoretic terms when enforcement becomes robotic citizens become children whether this will make us safer is debatable it will not make us better citizens see related letter "letters to
