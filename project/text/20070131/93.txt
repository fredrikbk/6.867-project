object lesson the question of who owns certain antiquities and where they should be shown faces many art museums in the u s europe and asia as well as government officials in "source nations" such as greece and italy since joining the j paul getty museum as director in december one of my top priorities has been to resolve italian and greek claims to objects in our antiquities collection after a careful review of the evidence the getty museum recently agreed to return four objects claimed by the greek ministry of culture we look forward to years of cultural cooperation and joint scholarship with our greek partners negotiations with our italian colleagues have been more challenging given their claim for objects and the fact that our former curator of antiquities is still on trial in rome apparently in an attempt to obtain more leverage against the getty and other museums nevertheless we have endeavored for over a year to find common ground with the italian ministry of culture each claim for each object has been carefully evaluated the evidence including that provided by italy has been subjected to critical analysis based on sound scholarship as well as legal and ethical considerations in october we signed an agreement with italy that set out what we had already come to agree upon as well as processes for resolving the remaining issues the getty agreed to return objects to italy including some of our greatest masterpieces italy agreed to renounce its claims to six objects and to provide significant loans to the getty with respect to the major unresolved issues we proposed immediate joint ownership by the getty and italy of the cult statue of a goddess often referred to as "aphrodite " during a period of collaborative research and if necessary neutral binding arbitration to resolve its ultimate fate we also agreed to provide the ministry with a formal written position supporting our claim to ownership of the statue of a victorious youth the so called "getty bronze " we were thus greatly surprised in early november when the italian ministry disavowed our agreement before even receiving our document on the getty bronze the ministry announced a new position that no final agreement would be possible without the transfer of this one object when i led a getty team back to rome later that month we were told by the minister of culture that the political climate in italy precluded any agreement without the transfer of the getty bronze that demand left no room for further discussion of the other unresolved issues and the meeting came to an end the italian ultimatum regarding the getty bronze is counterproductive the statue which was actually made by a greek artist was found in international waters in and was obtained by the getty museum in only after italian courts had declared that there was no evidence that the statue belonged to italy although italian legal proceedings regarding this statue date back to the ministry of culture has never before asserted a claim to this object in those proceedings i started these negotiations with a genuine spirit of compromise but i will not recommend to the gettys board of trustees the transfer of a publicly held work of art in response to a claim that is not supported by facts or international law i deeply regret that a claim to just one object has become a roadblock to resolution of the remaining issues and a pathbreaking agreement with italy whether or not we can find a way forward in the immediate future the getty remains committed to returning the objects to italy as agreed in october i have communicated this to the ministry but i have yet to receive a reply the getty will do its part to resolve this matter but for the good of museums everywhere political concerns must not eclipse a shared cultural responsibility to provide public access to the worlds artistic heritage mr brand is director of the j paul getty museum
