as yen slides fears mount of a shakeout currency carry trades have been popular bet europes export worry japans rock bottom interest rates are feeding a popular currency trade that could rock global markets if it were to unravel quickly the low rates are also sharply weakening the yen threatening the japanese market for u s and european exports in recent days the yen has hit a four year low against the dollar and an all time low against the euro since the start of the year the yen has fallen more than against the dollar "the yen is the weakest major currency in the world at this point " says daniel katzive a currency strategist at ubs japans near zero interest rates have made the yen the primary source of funding for a currency market maneuver that is helping undermine the yen investors can profit from japans low rates by borrowing yen and then investing the borrowed money in a country that has higher rates such as australia or new zealand the maneuver called the carry trade weakens the yen because investors sell off their yen to convert it to other currencies the extent of this kind of trading is notoriously difficult to measure but according to a jan report by barclays capital the magnitude of yen funded carry trades "is reaching scary levels" not seen since the risk is that investors could rapidly unwind these trades rattling currency markets analysts are divided however on how likely that might be to happen theres little relief in sight for the yen thats because interest rates are likely to remain extremely low which discourages investors from holding assets denominated in yen on jan the bank of japan decided not to raise interest rates keeping its key short term rate at just japans economy is sending mixed signals this week inflation and household spending data came in weaker than expected the central bank is concerned that raising rates too quickly would imperil economic growth currency strategists say that barring a series of interest rate increases the yen is likely to fall further in coming months to a point where one dollar buys as many as yen late in new york the dollar fetched yen while one euro bought yen another sign of bearish sentiment comes from one of the worlds biggest markets for currency related trading the chicago mercantile exchange where speculators as of jan had amassed a record position to sell short the yen in other words placing an investment bet that the currency will weaken the japanese currencys weakness is sounding alarm bells in europe where policy makers are concerned that a falling yen will make european exports too expensive for japanese customers some european officials are urging further discussion of the issue at a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the group of seven industrialized nations which starts feb so far u s reaction has been muted last week treasury under secretary timothy adams said in an interview that japans economic policy was "appropriate" and that the economy still had "weak spots " according to a report by bloomberg "the rhetoric from europe looks isolated and hence is likely to be ineffective " says derek halpenny senior currency economist at bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj in addition to watching statements from the g meeting currency traders will also keep their eyes on the potential for an interest rate increase by the bank of japan next month even if the central bank does raise rates in february "we reckon it will be a one and done situation " says joe prendergast head of global currency research at credit suisse a single rate increase would still leave japans rates very low by global standards and probably wouldnt do much to strengthen the currency analysts say small investors in japan are contributing to the longer term investment flows undermining the yen says mr halpenny of bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj they too are searching for better yields on fixed income investments that can only be found abroad as of december japans investment trusts held more than of their funds in foreign currencies he noted up from roughly at the start of there are several scenarios that could reverse the yens slide the first is if economic growth appeared strong enough to let the bank of japan embark on a series of interest rate increases something that looks unlikely at present another wild card is a "significant bout of risk aversion" among global investors says paresh upadhyaya of putnam investments in boston an event that scares investors like an act of terrorism natural disaster or a major tumble in the market might make them suddenly decide that playing cross border investment games with the yen is too uncertain right now however investors remain comfortable with carry trades because the underlying currencies havent shown much volatility if they did movements in exchange rates could wipe out any gains from the difference in interest rates an unraveling of carry trades could set off a rapid run up in the yen as investors bought back the currency to cover their original borrowing it might also produce broader ripples last spring the unwinding of such trades helped spark a plunge in emerging market stocks as investors fled riskier assets
