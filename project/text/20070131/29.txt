common sense an inexpensive way to bet on intel innovation calls smartmoney about years ago while i was working at the wall street journal i had lunch with bill gates at the lunch mr gates stressed that the pc revolution was all about software and chips with compaq and ibm then the darlings of investors this was a radical notion but one that made sense to me later i bought intel and microsoft shares and they have been in my portfolio ever since i followed all dow jones rules and held onto them for years within years they had split so many times and their value had climbed so fast that my basis was negligible ive been steadily giving those shares away to charity ever since i havent thought much about buying them these once cutting edge high growth s icons have turned into mature stalwarts of the dow jones industrial average as the internet threatened to leave them in the dust investor interest gravitated elsewhere and then last year i started hearing more about the likely resurgence of large cap growth stocks which have lagged behind value and small cap stocks since microsoft and intel shares had gotten so low and their price earnings ratios so modest that it wasnt clear they still qualify as growth stocks perhaps because of investor boredom there was little premium to be found in microsoft call options a call is an option to buy a security at a specific price and so i bought some to my surprise the large cap growth scenario seemed to catch on in last years final quarter and those options are now showing some handsome gains microsoft recently reported encouraging earnings even though they were somewhat distorted by delays in shipping the vista operating system intel shares also rallied modestly by the end of last year but sagged when intel reported disappointing earnings jan signs of a continuing price war with archrival advanced micro devices further depressed sentiment and so out of curiosity i took a look at prices for intel calls i noticed that the premium amounted to only pennies a share i wasnt planning to buy any but i couldnt resist a bargain with intel trading at slightly over &# i bought the &# calls expiring in for just over &# a contract that is nearly two years for which i paid a premium of a few cents one of the raps on intel is that it has lost its technological edge and by making chips that are essentially fungible with amds its profit margins have been eroding but i have always felt it a mistake to underestimate intels research and development prowess then intel announced a major technical breakthrough that could yield a new generation of super fast energy efficient chips the market didnt seem excited by the news with intel shares showing modest gains monday the &# calls of were quoted monday at &# with intel shares at &# a premium of cents a call the premiums rise as the strike price climbs intel shares closed yesterday at &# for that outlay you secure a position in a chip maker with &# billion in cash and the tailwind of a technological breakthrough that sounds like a large cap growth story to me james b stewart a columnist for smart money magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
