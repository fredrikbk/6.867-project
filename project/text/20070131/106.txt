progress in baghdad capitol hill has probably been too busy running for political cover to notice but the last few days in iraq have actually featured good news as the government seems to be making some progress on key political and security issues one step forward is that prime minister nouri al maliki has won parliamentary backing for his baghdad security plan this means the elected representatives of iraqs shiites sunnis and kurds remain capable of compromise and are willing to give the new strategy a chance to work theres also evidence that the baghdad plan is having an effect yes al qaeda bombs targeted the shiite ashoura holiday as expected but there are also widespread reports of sunni jihadists fleeing the capital in anticipation of a crackdown prime minister maliki has already started moving against shiite militias which might explain an apparent drop in sectarian violence no one should get overconfident but clearly the bad guys are taking the joint u s iraqi effort to pacify the capital seriously meanwhile the weekend saw an encouraging performance by the iraqi security forces who took control of the najaf area only about a month ago acting on their own intelligence iraqi police and a battalion from the eighth army division confronted a radical shiite sect calling themselves the soldiers of heaven who had reportedly planned to assassinate mainstream shiite clerics including the moderate grand ayatollah ali sistani some observers are trying to spin this battle as a defeat for the government because the first iraqi units on the scene had to call for reinforcements and for american air power but the fact that iraqi forces were able to pre empt the attack on najaf before it began and that everyone involved was able to coordinate the operation and soundly defeat the enemy makes it sound like a success to us hundreds of the insurgents were killed compared to a handful of iraqi and u s troops this may well be a model for how u s troops might play a supporting role down the road assuming washington gives them a chance to get baghdad under control first for the moment at least iraq seems to be inching in the right direction after a week of western lamentations about the gracelessness of the saddam hanging it became clear that the primary effect of the execution was to enhance prime minister malikis stature in iraq mr maliki in turn is using that political capital the last thing he needs is to have his efforts undermined by votes of no confidence in washington or meddling by congressmen with "benchmarks" who pretend to know better than he does how to deal with the most difficult issues such as how best to marginalize moqtada al sadr the bush administration has itself made many mistakes trying to micromanage iraqs political development but it now seems to understand that it is fated to deal with the shiite led government it has congressmen who are sincere in wanting to take the iraq issue off the table in could help by showing a similar combination of resolve and humility
