rates can change quickly "we might be one bad inflation or a decent payroll number away from another change " says mr bianco in fact some wall street economists believe the fed will raise rates this year if the economy continues to strengthen yet most economists see a long stretch of steady rates ahead and advisers are starting to shift strategies after recommending that investors lock in longer term securities last summer morris armstrong a financial planner in danbury conn started moving more of his clients money to short term cds "if you do think the fed is going to hold for a couple of months for the next three months at a minimum you want to stay under six months " he says for investors the prolonged period of flat rates is likely to boost cashs allure "its really uncertain which direction the fed is going and that has effectively put a floor under the yields on money markets and cds " says greg mcbride a senior financial analyst at bankrate com the yields on many cash
