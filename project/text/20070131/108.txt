politics &amp economics law shifts nih balance of power patient groups fear for their research as funds are pooled bethesda md a little noticed piece of legislation signed by president bush this month has given the director of the national institutes of health more budget authority over cutting edge research a prospect that worries traditional patient advocacy groups the new law ushers in a change in the balance of power at the nih the governments premier biomedical research agency most of the power at the nih an agency with a nearly &# billion annual budget has rested with the separate institutes and centers inside the nih and these semiautonomous parts have forged strong ties with patient advocacy groups on specific diseases "you have very strong fingers but no palm " says elias zerhouni director of the nih since "that doesnt make a hand " however congress has strengthened dr zerhounis hand considerably as part of a bill passed in decembers lame duck session dr zerhouni and his successors will be able to organize a "common fund" designed eventually to pool about of the nihs money that is &# billion a year at todays levels the idea is to pour funding into research projects that cut across traditional biomedical fields and across multiple nih fiefs the new program addresses some of congresss concerns that the nih is big slow and cant innovate but with the nihs overall budget flattening advocates for specific patient groups worry that the "common fund" will grow at the expense of their own research carving money out of their funds for example cancer research advocates want to protect studies funded by the national cancer institute which has a &# billion plus budget they dont quibble with the theory of cross disciplinary research they just worry about the practical effect dr zerhouni cites research into obesity and nanotechnology study at the atomic or molecular level as two high priority fields for the new money obesity is "a natural" for trans nih funding says robert young president of fox chase cancer center in philadelphia and head of the scientific advisory board of the national cancer institute "but is this going to happen at the expense of already assembled programs " already budget tightening has prompted the nci to conduct fewer clinical trials he says dr zerhouni says he recognizes that nih budgets are tight and likely to remain so for the next couple of years given that he says it will take "multiple years" for the fund to grow to of the overall budget he notes that the money will be awarded by a peer review process and that a special nih council will advise on the funds spending past attempts to give the nih director more control have foundered in the s then director bernadine healy tried to bring a more top down management style to the leafy nih campus she became a controversial figure by the time she left the nih in but didnt end up centralizing much power various proposals to cluster the nih into seven institutes also failed in the prestigious institute of medicine an arm of the national academy of sciences called for the nih directors job to be strengthened and suggested that a fund of or more of the nih budget be pooled for transdisciplinary research dr zerhouni arrived in when nih budgets were enjoying a five year doubling approved by congress a native of algeria and a radiologist by training dr zerhouni was dean for research and executive vice dean at johns hopkins universitys medical school at hopkins he says he grappled with what he considered a similar culture of academic "silos" and few transdisciplinary efforts at the nih he has named new directors of institutes or centers as at hopkins he defines his mission as "break barriers break convention break dogma " that is what lawmakers want to hear several members of congress have criticized the nih as a bloated bureaucracy lacking "bang" for its research buck doing the same old thing on a bigger budget and prone to occasional ethical lapses rep joe barton r texas former chairman of the house energy and commerce committee was among the loudest critics but in the past year or so he has become a supporter and led the effort to reauthorize the nih and to back many of dr zerhounis ideas for overhaul "chairman barton went from hostile to skeptical to becoming the first new champion of nih since the end of the budget doubling " says patrick white director of federal relations at the american association of universities which represents some of the biggest medical school recipients of nih grant money "zerhouni sold nih to barton " in a statement shortly after congress passed the nih overhaul bill rep barton said that the agency "has grown like topsy" and that the new legislation would "strengthen the research efforts of the nih and will provide the foundation for future scientific and medical advancement " dr zerhouni has been preparing the organization for more cross pollination launching a pilot project for the common fund called the nih roadmap it was successful and helped bolster the case for more centralized pooling of funds today the roadmap and other trans nih programs account for about of the nihs budget but the idea of expanding such a fund to even over several years brought out quiet but firm opponents from specific patient advocate groups who lobbied congress to put the brakes on the plan at one point the house version of the nih bill would have explicitly limited growth in the common fund to growth in the size of the overall budget congress shot down that idea though dr zerhouni says he embraces the go slow approach "people were saying its a power grab by the director " says dr zerhouni about his adversaries he considers the new legislation a "personal vindication" of his tenure at the nih although the provisions will outlast him in congress the house early this week began action to set aside in the budget resolution some &# million specifically for the common fund the nih director has to report to congress once of the nih budget is allocated to the common fund under the new law it could grow larger than eventually dr zerhouni says he believes the nih has "regained both the confidence and support of congress " if that lasts it will likely be an important part of his legacy the larger test of the nih overhaul will be whether the initiatives lead to scientific advances and improved diagnoses and medical treatments most of those results wont be known for years or decades
