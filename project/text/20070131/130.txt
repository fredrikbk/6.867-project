the numbers guy coke dangles big prizes for customers with lots of time and soda at hand want a &# baseball glove for "free" heres one way to get it you could shell out hundreds of dollars on bottles of coke then diligently visit a special web site every day over the next month and a half entering the "coke rewards" codes printed on the bottle caps that glove would be yours the numbers behind cokes airline miles style promotion are mind boggling each ounce bottle of coke or related brands is worth three points and each pack of cans contains a code worth points the "cheapest" items in the rewards catalog include things like a blockbuster movie rental for points or a coca cola key tag with bottle opener for points plenty of items go for points or more that baseball glove is points and a &# sony mp player requires points or more than bottles of coke but thats nothing compared with the biggest prizes such as a walk on role in a television show or a family rv vacation those require points that translates into a gut busting bottles of coke or cases ignoring for a moment whether anyone could or should consume that much soda consider another facet of the promotion you can only redeem codes a day so even in a best case scenario if you had started your quest in february when coke launched the giveaway and stuck with the higher value codes from the packs it would take you days to get that walk on tv role thats an improvement from the programs early days when coke discovered that it had set some of the required point values so high that it could be impossible for anyone to collect enough bottle codes to win the prizes before the promotion ends in april "we did tweak the program early when we were able to determine that we needed to make some of the more aspirational prizes more attainable " said coca cola co spokesman scott williamson he said the company has occasional contests where people can win additional points to spend some people have won as many as points he said more than enough to claim a top prize he wasnt able to tell me if anyone had been able to claim one of the big ticket items simply by obtaining and entering reward codes for loyal coke drinkers winning the big prize by entering codes alone can exact a big price and not only in dollars spent on soft drinks entering the codes is a chore first you have to register at mycokerewards com which in my firefox browser took me about two minutes the final step involves navigating nine check boxes with options to receive various commercial emails coke also lets people register their cellphones so that they can input codes through text messaging that additional step added another minute for me on future visits to the web site you must login and navigate to a page where you enter the character coke rewards code the codes printed on bottle caps are hard to read in dark type on a dark red background and include a mix of letters and numbers jvmbmxmvwvw the process of logging into the graphics heavy web site and entering a single code took me seconds i found the cellphone method a bit faster at seconds if i were unable to improve on that pace and i used only point codes from packs and the speedier but more expensive under most cellphone plans text messaging option it would take me more than hours of work to win the biggest prizes that assumes no bathroom breaks related to the cans of coke i would have purchased of course of course supplies are also limited some coke fans have complained in online forums that they saved up enough codes to redeem for a sony psp gaming system only to learn that coke ran out of the items "its a living breathing program " said cokes mr williamson he said coke is sometimes able to secure more items from suppliers its clear that coke needed to come up with a system where people couldnt cheat by entering random codes still the character codes seem like overkill with letters and digits available for each character there are billion trillion possible codes if coke were to use up all of those codes on ounce bottles the volume of liquid within them would be about times the volume of water in all the earths oceans mr williamson said the codes help ensure the contests security and also allow coke to track the location of purchases used in the contest the promotion troubled julia havey a year old st louis diet book author she sued coke in july because she said contest entrants who wanted to win the biggest prizes solely using coke products would have to drink more than a hundred each day a dangerous volume of liquid and a fattening amount if the drinks arent diet coke countered that the products didnt need to be consumed by the buyers who might for instance be supplying parties ms havey dropped the suit a few weeks later "i proved my point on the budget that i had to prove my point " she told me mr williamson reiterated cokes point that diet drinks are included and added that the lawsuit is "old and over " matt volk a year old electrical engineer in chicago said he has reached points but he has dozens more he hasnt bothered to enter because his desired minifridge is no longer available he blogged about his frustrations mr volk theorized that the only people with a legitimate chance to win the big prizes are people who fill up vending machines with cans and keep the codes from the packs cokes mr williamson told me the company bars its employees or employees of its affiliates from redeeming more than points and tries to enforce that by requiring them to register with their corporate email addresses he said there are security measures in place for preventing the vending machine scenario but declined to elaborate mr williamson said more than million prizes have been redeemed already that included several prizes in january for points or more such as big screen tvs and a trip to the pebble beach golf course he said nearly million people have opened reward accounts among the most popular items claimed thus far he said are coca cola branded items and plastic american idol cups several numbers guy readers suggested i take a look at a recent front page new york times article with this surprising headline " of women are now living without spouse " the article said that "for what experts say is probably the first time more american women are living without a husband than with one " it went on to note that in married couples became a minority of all american households for the first time and said the dynamic could "ultimately shape social and workplace policies including the ways government and employers distribute benefits " but it wasnt until the st paragraph that the article revealed that the analysis based on census data included all american women aged and up several critics including the boston globes jeff jacoby and the christian science monitor pointed out that counting females aged to is dubious most states require women to be at least before marrying without parental consent a spokeswoman for the times told me in an email "our article used the category that the census bureau uses and has used for decades in dealing with marital status years and over since this has been consistent over time we felt that the comparisons were fair " the times analysis was derived from the census bureaus latest american community survey an annual survey of of the population the survey found that of american females aged and up werent living with a husband because they werent married or were widowed divorced separated or otherwise living apart such as when a husband is at war i found that excluding females aged to just three out of every thousand in that group live with a husband lowers the headline percentage to thats not a huge absolute change from but enough to diminish the storys impact the times report got wide attention and the findings were repeated by agence france presse the san francisco chronicle the south florida sun sentinel and others almost none noted that the age cutoff was with the help of the census bureau i calculated comparable figures for prior years and found that the shift has been steady but slow in of females and older lived without a husband in the figure was and even as far back as when the census bureaus age groupings were slightly different of females aged and older lived without a husband thanks to everyone who
