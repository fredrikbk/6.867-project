why most of the homeless are intractable in face of attempts to help them how could julia vitullo martin "homeless in america " editorial page jan write a word article on homelessness in america and not once mention the term "deinstitutionalization" almost every psychiatrist from those that still think it was a good idea to essentially shut down our mental hospital system once thorazine haldol and other drugs that control somewhat the symptoms of psychosis became available to those like fuller torrey who think it was a dangerous and ill conceived movement agrees that half or more of the chronic street homeless are severely mentally ill it is estimated that today there are well over a million people with schizophrenia major depression and bipolar disorder who using standards would be inside mental hospitals are outside today some the lucky ones find treatment in either small private psychiatric hospitals or in special programs usually located in rural or suburban areas with almost a one to one counselor patient ratio and where their taking of medication is strictly monitored but the others have been living lives that make even those depicted in the famous anti mental hospital movie "the snake pit" seem not so bad in comparison instead of being released into lives more humane and caring than could be provided in a mental hospital which was the basic goal of the deinstitutionalists their fate has been either living in shelters living in special shabby "hotels" for the mentally ill funded by medicaid living in the streets or in the worst cases criminal behavior leading to terms in prison or sudden outbursts of psychotic frenzy that lead to deaths of bystanders or themselves either as suicides or at the hands of police trying to subdue them if this is the character of the major part of the homeless population what is one to make of the survey of approaches to the problem presented by ms vitullo martin the one actual program described in detail in her article would be ludicrous as an approach to the homeless mentally ill if the problem were not so serious this is the "housing first" program in new york city its approach is not to watch or be concerned with what the program participants do in private just their public behavior has to be monitored and sanctions applied but the central problem of the homeless mentally ill is to get them in a highly monitored situation that will ensure they are taking their medication mayor bloomberg is quoted as promising to take on the problem by getting tough with advocates for the homeless whatever that is supposed to mean most "advocates" are parents and relatives of the deinstitutionalized mentally ill who try to get better care for them one wonders if he realizes that there are between to street homeless with psychotic mental disease in the city and that to really provide them with facilities and programs that would ensure they stay on their medications and avoid getting into trouble on the city streets would probably cost &# billion to &# billion a mere to increase in what the city now spends on providing all medical care go get em mike if president bushs &# billion effort to end street homelessness is going to be used for funding many programs like "housing first " then its chance of making a dent in the huge fraction of homelessness due to deinstitutionalization is nil dave m oneill resident economist nathan kline institute for psychiatric research orangeburg n y see related letter "letters to the editor the first reductions of street homelessness in years" wsj feb correction the attribution for dave m oneill author of a jan letter was incorrect he is adjunct professor of economics baruch college cuny he was formerly a resident economist at the nathan kline institute for psychiatric research wsj feb
