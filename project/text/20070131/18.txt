bhp rio tinto may offer deeper value despite rising costs large mining firms are expected to maintain growth melbourne australia despite speculation that the china driven commodities boom could be faltering analysts remain confident that bhp billiton and rio tinto will continue to ride the dragon falling commodity prices and spiraling costs have taken a toll on the shares of both global miners since may bhp is off a peak that month while rio tinto which doesnt have petroleum operations like its bigger rival has dropped but the selling has been overdone many analysts and fund managers say and the slide in market values represents a buying opportunity rio tinto will report full year results tomorrow while bhp will release results for the first six months ended dec on feb ubs mining analyst glyn lawcock has a "buy" rating on both stocks "they are underpinned by strong cash flow and by what we believe will be a strong reporting period that will see them return surplus cash again over and above what we saw last year " he says mr lawcock adds that unless there is another big run up in commodity prices like the one that produced the may peaks he expects "a more sustainable but progressive rise in the share prices " for shares of bhp which closed yesterday in sydney at australian dollars us&# ubs has a month target of a&# rio tinto in its view should go as high as a&# it

shares racing from around a&# in mid to a closing high of a&# in may bhp surged from just above a&# to a&# over the same period as the "stronger for longer" mantra became market orthodoxy and investment funds took big positions in the metals sector but analysts say the prices rose too hard too fast and a correction sparked by fears of a slowing u s economy and weaker chinese demand was inevitable in recent weeks fund manager argo investments has been adding to its holdings in both bhp and rio tinto rob patterson who helps manage a&# billion in funds at argo says that with continuing growth in china india europe and japan it is hard to see commodity prices falling much farther while cost pressures are a genuine concern they arent yet denting bhps and rio tintos profitability he says bhp recently revealed a series of cost blowouts and delays with the price tag of its ravensthorpe nickel mine in western australia rising to us&# billion the atlantis oil and gas field in the gulf of mexico climbing to us&# billion and the cost of expansion at the alumar alumina refinery in brazil rising to us&# million this month rio tinto said its clermont coal mine in queensland will now cost us&# million more than double its estimate such cost increases have "probably scared the market a bit " mr patterson says "there are a lot of labor pressures and cost pressures in the industry and thats probably taking a little bit of cream off but as long as commodity prices dont fall too hard they are still making a very good margin " he says the fortunes of bhp and rio tinto have been boosted by a december agreement with global steelmakers for a increase in iron ore prices for the month period that begins april this compares with a increase for the year that ends march and in many analysts now prefer rio tinto over bhp for its greater exposure to bulk commodities such as iron ore and coking coal which have prices locked in at high rates and offer protection from sector volatility the falling price of crude oil also has some analysts forecasting that bhps petroleum division will underperform in the short term but abn amros rob clifford said he favors bhp for what he sees as a larger collection of development projects and for its nickel assets "the growth profile looks good although they will have to continue to deliver " the analyst says "the share price has underperformed rio over the last months and that hasnt been justified " abn amro has month price targets of a&# for bhp and a&# for rio tinto and a "buy" rating on each analysts expect rio tinto
