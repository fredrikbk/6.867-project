constitutional warp the constitution gives the president primary responsibility for defending national interests on the world stage he is the nations chief executive and commander in chief of its armed forces congressional efforts to limit the exercise of these powers in iraq by for example purporting to limit the number of american troops there or for that matter to increase the u s contingent in afghanistan would be unconstitutional even if linked to an exercise of congresss own appropriations power the iraqi resolutions congress is most likely to adopt particularly sen joseph bidens objection to surging additional troops to iraq are non binding still the writing is on the wall if the president ignores this resolution as he is constitutionally entitled to do then additional provisions seeking to tie his hands will follow however unless congress withdraws funding for the iraqi war as a whole the president would similarly be justified in refusing to comply the framers of the constitution deliberately created a system under which the three branches of government could exert their powers in disparate and conflicting ways over time this has resulted in multiple inefficiencies particularly as successive congresses and presidents have struggled over foreign and defense policies however while the constitution anticipates a certain ebb and flow of authority between president and congress it does not envision a situation where one branch can entirely vitiate the power of another as james madison noted in the federalist papers "the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others " the separation of powers is an indispensable guarantee of liberty the constitution vests congress with formidable authority to affect how the president fights wars congress has the power to declare war formally rupturing the international legal relations between the u s and a belligerent enemy nation and to prescribe rules governing military discipline and regulating the capture of enemy property ultimately congress determines the size of the federal military establishment and what weapons it can buy if it determines to withhold funding for an ongoing conflict it can compel the president to withdraw u s forces what congress cannot do however is direct how a president prosecutes a particular war including decisions about how many of the available forces to introduce into a theater of conflict the framers briefly considered vesting congress with the power to "make war" but quickly thought better of it limiting congress instead to the power to "declare war " this according to constitutional convention delegate rufus king was because "make war might be understood to conduct it which was an executive function " the president is in short responsible for all tactical operational and strategic decisions involved in war fighting as the supreme court explained in a mexican war case fleming v page "as commander in chief he is authorized to direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at his command and to employ them in the manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy " fifteen years later concurring in the landmark case of ex parte milligan chief justice salmon p chase put it more crisply still "congress cannot direct the conduct of campaigns " the unconstitutionality of a congressional effort to direct the course of hostilities in iraq and afghanistan when taken to its logical conclusion is so clear that even supporters of limiting the presidents war fighting powers concede that congress cannot go so far as to prescribe the number of troops that may be deployed to anbar province or dictate which units should operate in kandahar as opposed to baghdad this however is a distinction without a difference fundamental decisions about wartime strategy are the most important part of the presidents commander in chief portfolio with battlefield tactics usually determined by his military commanders fundamental disagreements between the president and congress over strategic decisions are not unique to this war and have occurred in the past doubtless many congressmen believed that lincolns early determination to destroy lees army in virginia was counterproductive when more could be gained along the mississippi river in the west just as some congressional republicans felt that roosevelt was overinvesting in the european theater during world war ii while "starving" the pacific theater where to borrow todays favorite democratic mantra the enemy that actually attacked this country resided there also have been efforts to direct presidential wartime decision making and at least one instance after the major u s involvement in the vietnam war had ended where congress sought to establish particular troop levels however this occurred late in the conflict and its constitutionality was never accepted by the executive branch there are nevertheless clear limits to the presidents power as commander in chief in fleming the court noted "he the president may invade the hostile country and subject it to the sovereignty and authority of the united states but his conquests do not enlarge the boundaries of this union nor extend the operation of our institutions and laws beyond the limits before assigned to them by the legislative power " similarly the president cannot take over control of the nations economy on the pretext that this is necessary to the successful prosecution of a war that is the clear teaching of the supreme courts decision in youngstown sheet &amp tube v sawyer which declared unconstitutional trumans seizure of u s steel mills on account of a strike during the korean war in this respect congresss paramount authority to regulate foreign and domestic commercial activity including labor relations and capital markets remains undiminished in wartime thus congress could cripple the presidents ability to fight a war accepting the political consequences but it cannot supervise his own constitutional authority as commander in chief effectively transferring those functions to congress this balancing exercise rooted in the framers political philosophy and appreciation for the newtonian physics of motion and countermotion permeates our constitutional system for example the president plays a critical part in the legislative process by proposing legislation having executive branch officials testify in hearings negotiating with members of congress and ultimately by exercising his veto power but congress retains the primary legislative role when congress augmented executive power in the s with a "line item veto " the supreme court struck down the measure allowing the president to void particular portions in an overall spending bill it said would upset the constitutions "finely wrought and exhaustively considered" legislative procedure the district court which first invalidated the scheme went further by noting that "by ceding inherently legislative authority to the president the line item veto act violates the constitutional framework " permitting congress to direct the war in iraq would similarly warp our constitutional framework messrs rivkin and casey served in the justice department under ronald reagan and george h w bush
