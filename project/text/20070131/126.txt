business day sign up for the e mail here the u s air force is once again finalizing a bidding process for the replacement of its cold war era fleet of aerial refueling tankers but it may not offer much more room for competition than the deal that fell apart in scandal about three years ago the pentagon released the final requirements for the bidding yesterday in hopes that boeing and the rival coalition of northrop grumman and european aeronautic defence and space would both go after the initial &# billion contract but while boeing whose sweetheart deal to lease s to the air force collapsed in corruption allegations and under pressure from sen john mccain said it was in northrop eads decided to defer comment northrop executives have said they wont bid if the final requirements favor the smaller cheaper and the seattle post intelligencer suggests this could be the case the companies have until april to submit a proposal or withdraw from the bidding northrop would be offering the kc essentially a modified airbus a which cost about &# million compared to the s &# million air force generals have said they favor having more tankers in the sky rather than fewer if bigger tankers and speaking to the pi defense industry analyst loren thompson says air force officials who have seen the final proposal request told him little had changed from a draft that provoked the worries at northrop northrop had been hoping the kc s additional capacity and functions including cargo and passenger capabilities could outweigh the price disadvantage as the wall street journal notes but while yesterdays guidelines said cost differences wont be the only deciding factor they dont add the kind of specific formula for judging the non fueling capabilities that northrop had sought air force

seeking a seat on its board and tells the wall street journal he wants motorola to spend its &# billion in cash to repurchase its shares that sent motorolas stock price up nearly yesterday but motorola has other problems current management might feel more pressing including a collapse in profit margins for the popular razr phone a loss of buzz to buzz king apples much awaited iphone and a
