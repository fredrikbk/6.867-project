church and state as chinas bishops die off clash looms with vatican pope and communists vie to name successors liu jingshans trials as beijing and the vatican escalate their battle for control of the roman catholic church in china people like bishop liu jingshan are caught painfully in the middle the head of a diocese in the dusty plains of western china the year old bishop is one of the churchs last living links with a pre communist china when catholics could freely profess their allegiance to the pope bishop liu also serves in the compromised present day world of catholicism in this country in a government approved church which the vatican and many catholics view as illegitimate for more than two decades bishop liu and many other chinese catholics have discreetly divided their loyalties between two masters gently nudging both toward a hoped for rapprochement but as bishop lius generation ages the bridge between beijing and rome is wearing thin worsening tensions on both sides each seat of authority claims the right to appoint catholic bishops and neither will talk to the other so every time a chinese bishop dies or retires there is the potential for a conflict to erupt over his successor the average age of a bishop in china is now and at least bishops are known to have died in the past two years more than two dozen of the dioceses in china are now without their own bishops bishop liu already years past the normal retirement age for a bishop knows only too well his time to step down is coming "i know i am old the priests who were my classmates are all gone " he says last year the chinese catholic patriotic association the official body which oversees local catholics appointed three bishops who had not been approved by the pope that reversed years of quiet progress toward accommodation which had included signals that the vatican was willing to switch diplomatic recognition to china from rival taiwan anger over the consecrations has prompted the vatican to re evaluate its effort to restore ties with beijing pope benedict xvi earlier this month summoned religious leaders from hong kong macau and taiwan where the church is free of chinese government influence for a two day meeting with his top foreign policy advisers pope benedict now plans to issue a letter addressed to the estimated million catholics living in china according to a vatican statement in two statements last year the vatican warned that any bishops appointed without papal approval could be excommunicated the struggle over who will lead chinese catholics is frequently opaque revealed only in the nuanced signals that are a hallmark of both the vatican and the chinese communist party still the stakes for the church are enormous china represents an unparalleled opportunity to increase the catholic faith at a moment when its traditional stronghold of europe is weakening the conflicts within the chinese church have left it lagging behind energetic protestant sects in preaching to the chinese "it would be a great sorrow to me if as china develops more and more into one of the most important forces in the world it does not know the grace and wonder of christ and his church " says cardinal theodore e mccarrick the former archbishop of washington d c who has frequently traveled to china as an unofficial envoy for rome the tensions over the catholic church are also turning into a test of just how much freedom chinas government is willing to allow religious organizations in a materialist society whose people are increasingly hungry for spirituality the difficulty is made more acute for catholics by the central role of the pope and the religious bureaucracy he heads which the communist party sees as a rival for political authority in the years following the revolution catholics were denounced as agents of an imperialist power foreign priests and missionaries were expelled and many chinese priests including bishop liu were imprisoned later during the chaos of the cultural revolution the church essentially vanished from public life as mobs hounded believers and tore down many cathedrals todays china is somewhat more welcoming the country officially recognizes five religions including catholicism but still keeps tabs on their leaders through a government bureaucracy and a collection of five "patriotic" organizations catholics in particular have long been viewed with suspicion as possible political activists with loyalties to a foreign power in rome "the chinese government and the chinese people are afraid of the church turning and playing the role that it did in poland " says liu bainian vice chairman of the official chinese catholic patriotic association referring to the churchs influence in the uprising against polands communist rulers in the late s that paved the way for free elections on the other side many catholics feel the patriotic association has traded the true faith for allegiance to the communist party "the official church in china is not obedient to the pope they are obedient to the chinese government by definition they are not roman catholic " says joseph kung who runs the u s based cardinal kung foundation and is an advocate for chinas "underground" church the semi secret group of priests and bishops who dont register with the patriotic association and are often harassed and imprisoned in recent years at least underground bishops and numerous priests have disappeared been arrested or detained in isolation according to asia news a vatican affiliated news agency that monitors church affairs in china some have died in prison even so traditionalists within the open church have spent decades quietly building up ties with the vatican while participating in an organization that has openly called for the chinese churchs "independence" from the pope they have privately sought his blessing and tried to increase exchanges between chinese catholics and those abroad "even though i spent years in prison i do love my country but do you think i only love my country i also love my church " says bishop liu born in to a catholic family in inner mongolia he studied at a seminary there run by belgian and dutch missionaries after being made a priest he served as a local pastor and later the head of his old seminary bishop liu was just years old when he was first imprisoned in the chaos and antiforeign frenzy that followed the communist revolution even after his sentence ended in he was a suspect individual he supported himself by laboring in the fields while the cultural revolution engulfed society it was only after mao zedongs death in that religion was slowly allowed back into the open in the late s as chinas new leaders began easing government controls "the churches all opened we could practice our religion " recalls bishop liu "we didnt have any books or vestments but we started to preach again " but the communist partys opening to religion came with a stark choice cooperate with the government and be allowed to preach openly or continue in hiding bishop liu wanted to work in the open the government in inner mongolia where bishop liu had served much of his sentence still saw him as a political criminal so in he left and went to yinchuan capital of the western province of ningxia it was there that at the age of he truly began his lifes work "i still had something to do for the lord find a way to build up the church " bishop liu says holding forth in his room next to yinchuans church which holds a desk some chairs for visitors a spartan cot and a toilet yinchuan has a harsh dry climate and a heavily muslim population yet it proved fertile ground for the catholic missionaries who first arrived in by catholic records showed about believers in ningxia but when bishop liu then just an ordinary priest arrived in catholicism had been driven almost completely from public life his first task was to make contact with those believers who were left he traveled around its many isolated mountain villages reconnecting with catholics who had gone into hiding he also scrounged together land money and material to rebuild yinchuans crumbling cathedral the government was prepared to give the church and the land back to local catholics bishop liu still had to find the resources to rebuild the church and keep it running in he cut a deal giving up part of the churchs land to a government real estate company in exchange for money to build a new church the building finished in still stands building up the human base of the diocese proved just as challenging a half dozen nuns had survived but they were even older than bishop liu so he roamed around northwest china to recruit today bishop liu has priests by his side and or so nuns and has also set up churches outside yinchuan his church is still struggling "our biggest difficulty here is that the congregation isnt big enough " says bishop liu he estimates he looks after seven or eight thousand catholics many more than in but just a tiny fraction of the provinces roughly six million people in he was named bishop of ningxia by the patriotic association he squared that with his faith by seeking and receiving a blessing from pope john paul ii having a recognized official status has been a help bishop liu has used his government contacts to get some money sent from a seminary in wealthy shanghai jeroom heyndrickx a belgian priest who has known the bishop for more than years says catholics critical of the official church should still respect his accomplishments "he is in my view a great man a courageous man " says father heyndrickx "these old priests and bishops have done a tremendous job to rebuild the church and have been misunderstood for it " while bishop liu has found a way to practice in the open church without breaking ties with rome he must now find a successor who can do the same three years ago a bishop in a neighboring province recommended a priest who has become his preferred candidate li jing a german trained theologian who is now vice rector at the government supported national seminary in beijing father li says he feels too young and inexperienced to take up the post but will not contest the judgment of his elders in the church father li hasnt been formally appointed yet to become a bishop in chinas open church he must be elected by the diocese in a meeting that usually includes the local priests and some nuns and prominent laypeople they will then seek approval for the choice from the patriotic association in recent years the process has often included some kind of informal approach to the pope where the candidate will write to ask for his blessing as bishop liu did though direct communication is technically not permitted word can be passed through catholics in hong kong and taiwan the vatican has tried to bring the open church into the fold noting in its recent statement that "almost all of the bishops and priests are in communion with the supreme pontiff " the vatican has maintained hopes that such informal coordination could eventually serve as the basis of a more formal agreement that would end the conflict over the churchs status in china of the sort it has reached with other communist nations like vietnam just last week vietnams prime minister met with pope benedict in the vatican a historic first that vatican officials believe could eventually lead to a restoration of diplomatic ties in china though the patriotic association has been sending mixed signals of the five new chinese bishops consecrated in the official church in two of them were consensus appointments with both papal and government approval however the other three who now head the dioceses of kunming in the southwest and anhui and xuzhou in the east did not receive papal approval the vatican doesnt publicly discuss the selection process but church observers say the priests who didnt receive the popes blessing were seen by some as too close to the government and unlikely to stand up for church interests one of the priests liu xinhong the new bishop of anhui had asked for the popes approval although he didnt receive it he took the post anyway he acknowledged in an interview with state run media that his decision caused the priests and nuns in his diocese much "internal turmoil " the vatican called his appointment and others "a grave wound to the unity of the church " a senior church official who has advised the pope on the issue said the consecrations have revived fears that chinas leadership will reverse some of the accommodation of recent years and try to consolidate the open churchs independence from rome that could mean a schism in the church creating a rival version of the catholic faith in the worlds most populous country bishop liu whose few remaining wisps of hair float out from his skullcap knows he may not have enough time to see his ultimate hope realized "we are with the pope " he says "we want to bring the churches together "
