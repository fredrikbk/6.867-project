a lifetime of photos on a single disc new services cheaply quickly digitize troves of snapshots throwing away the shoebox when his father died in dale pelletier a vice president of the allianz se insurance company in chicago inherited boxes of black and white photos and a sense of obligation to make copies for his four siblings but after a few evenings spent scanning them into his computer he gave up because "it was a lot of work and a lot of time " then last year he learned about an online mail order service called shoeboxreprints com in irvine calif that would scan as many as photos for &# and send back the images on a cd mr pelletier used the service and then used the images to create a book of his fathers life using mypublisher com an online photo book company since then he has used the scanning service to digitize all of his mothers old pictures as well as the pictures he took before he switched to digital cameras five years ago "ive had photos scanned everything is in iphoto in my mac and now the fun begins " he says he used some of them to make a book and a slide show for his daughters th birthday party an increasing number of photo service stores are starting to offer quick and economical scanning services for shutterbugs many of whom have thousands of snapshots "archived" in shoeboxes and plastic crates in attics and closets the scanned images may not be sharp enough to blow up into much bigger prints and the images are stored as numbered files on the cd so you have to open the image to know what the picture is but once the pictures are digitized on a cd or dvd it is easy to make more copies or store and label them on a computer hard drive "im just glad theres a service like this " says jo ann cotton a head start teacher who had pictures scanned at blossers camera &amp portrait studio in warsaw ind ms cottons son in pittsburgh who is getting married in may had asked her to send him childhood pictures for a presentation he was preparing "but we only had one copy of each photo and i didnt like sending them through the mail in case they got lost or damaged " she says flatbed scanners costing less than &# can make high quality copies but most

charleston w va for photo stores many of which were hurt by consumers shift to digital photography and the resulting decline in sales of film and photo printing scanning services are a promising new opportunity in addition to scanning the stores can charge extra for premium services like editing scanned pictures to eliminate defects like "red eye " tom skaggs who owns blossers and bought the

document imaging unit hadnt even considered the old photo problem when it developed the scanner lois powell kodaks manager for document imaging says her division is descended from the companys old microfiche business and markets to big companies that need to make digital copies of paper documents like insurance forms and checks kodak is still assessing the market among other possibilities is a self service bulk scanning kiosk where consumers could load their own pictures kodaks chief executive antonio perez says the company is developing software that can sort and label scanned photos by the date they were taken and possibly group together multiple images of a person ms powell says rapidly scanned images are fine for printing snapshots but if someone anticipates printing a larger size picture they should scan the picture on a flat bed scanner with higher resolution auto feed scanners also cant handle photos mounted on cardboard or color polaroid pictures which are too thick she

challenging because images are labeled with four digit numbers mr goldstone suggests that since the scanners handle all kinds of documents customers can put index cards in the box of photos describing each group of photos when viewing thumbnail images on a computer screen that makes it easy to see where one group ends and the next begins he also sells proof books with images on each page for &# a
