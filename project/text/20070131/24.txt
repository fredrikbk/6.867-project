classical musicians suffer for their art classical musicians enjoy gossip as much as anyone just consider the popularity of blair tindalls book "mozart in the jungle sex drugs and classical music " but there is a subject that even the most jaded sophisticates in this profession still speak about in hushed tones if at all performance related injury pain and disability are commonplace aspects of a life in sports but for musicians who are in the words of pianist leon fleisher "athletes of the small muscles " they are often considered a personal failing as well as a threat to status and career as dr william j dawson president of the performing arts medicine association pama put it recently "theres always somebody lurking over your shoulder to take your chair " mr fleisher a leading pianist of his generation spent many years playing repertoire for the left hand after his right hand was afflicted with crippling problems and only recently managed to release his first recording of the standard repertoire in years tonight he will be performing at the kimmel center in philadelphia gary graffman another of americas most promising artists also lost the use of his right hand and began playing concerts with his left alone violinist peter oundjian a remarkable musician and onetime first violinist of the tokyo string quartet had to give up his instrument entirely he now conducts pianist murray perahia has been waylaid more than once by a swollen thumb this is the public face of the problem yet the true extent of the situation is stunning dr kris chesky of the texas center for music and medicine remembers attending a recent conference at northwestern university during which it was reported that of their entering music majors reported some kind of physical difficulty at the university of north texas with which dr chesky is affiliated of piano majors participating in a survey reported having pain associated with their playing such data collection is a relatively new phenomenon many of the most dramatic examples follow a pattern similar to mr fleishers "back in " he reports "i experienced an involuntary curling of my fourth and fifth fingers i went from doctor to doctor then on to eastern medicine i tried everything from aroma therapy to zen buddhism and no one had any answers it turns out what i have is called focal dystonia which attacks a limited number of muscles it usually happens to people who use fine muscles under pressure surgeons get it in their hands horn players in their lips singers in their vocal cords " there is no clear answer about its origins says mr fleisher and he explains although he is playing again he is not cured yet a combination of deep muscle massage known as rolfing and botox injections to control muscle spasms has let him fight his way back if there is no known single cause however he can certainly point to several culprits "students think that if they are simply pumping ivory or these days pumping plastic they are improving thats nonsense anything thats done mindlessly is dangerous " he says "i also place some blame on the record companies and on vladimir horowitz young people dont realize that his piano was rigged with extra light action and lacquered hammers for a bright sound students working on a lousy piano try to get that same sound and speed they fail to realize that there is a limit to what you can do " there is only so much physical effort that anyone can safely exert mr oundjian has similar ideas about the nature of the problem "when i think about leon with whom i have spoken a lot i realize that we are in some ways similar personality types playing the music of beethoven brahms and shostakovich we put perhaps too much of ourselves into it this situation rarely happens to someone who keeps a more objective approach you have to have your soul in the music of course but not every muscle in your body it is so important to use minimum contractions even today young violinists are taught to press their fingers down with force and it is very destructive in my own teaching i talk of using weight instead of pressure placing the focus on lifting and releasing " until recently musicians seeking relief had only limited opportunity for expert care but methods of relaxation and balancing such as yoga tai chi and the very popular alexander technique are offered in most cities and at many festivals and some solo practitioners have developed impressive reputations for healing in an apartment in new yorks carnegie hall a lithuanian born physical therapist named shmuel tatz who bills himself as a "body tuner " has garnered endorsements from such celebrity musicians as isaac stern yehudi menuhin rosalyn tureck and christa ludwig a session with mr tatz who prods and massages and puts you through a rigorous routine of movement and posture adjustment does amount to a tuning of sorts and his admirers are legion yet many suffering musicians have been unable to find a ready solution to their problems janet horvath associate principal cello with the minnesota orchestra ended up writing a handbook called "playing less hurt an injury prevention guide for musicians" www playinglesshurt com "my phone has rung off the hook with injured colleagues from all over the country who need a shoulder to cry on and trusted references " she reports still things are rapidly changing for the better when alice brandfonbrener director of the medical program for performing artists at the rehabilitation institute of chicago began working at the aspen music festival in there was no coordinated effort to help musicians in dr brandfonbrener put together the first meeting ever of doctors to discuss the subject and her efforts grew into pama www artsmed org now a world wide network today in chicago she explains new and better approaches are being developed research has offered a glimmer of hope that specific exercises and techniques to retrain the fingers can alleviate many problems "we found changes in the brains of the people we have been treating this way " she announced indicating that long term relief may be in sight education has also become a priority according to dr dawson the national association of schools of music now mandates that music schools provide health information to students as a requirement for recertification at the university of north texas explains dr chesky music students are already offered classes in musicians health issues as part of the "wellness" requirement in the core curriculum they learn about preserving muscular health avoiding hearing loss dealing with emotional problems and more one interesting conclusion of the research program is that many piano students are now asian or female and both groups tend to have smaller hands as a result at this university two steinways are modifiable so that narrower keyboards can be slipped into place doctoral recitals sometimes utilize a smaller keyboard preventing unnecessary strain on the performer and why not standardized keyboards are a fairly recent development and some artists of the past including the legendary early th century piano virtuoso josef hofmann used pianos with narrower keys the field seems to be blossoming the newly opened louis armstrong music and health clinic for musicians and performing artists at beth israel hospital in new york run by music therapist joanne loewy and medical director stephan quentzel employs what they describe as a holistic approach to address the physical emotional and musical aspects of the problem "say you bring your car in for repair and it has a problem with the muffler " explains dr loewy "you get a new muffler but the problem is still there then you put in new shocks or brakes but ultimately you realize that the problem really lies with the driver integrating all the systems is the key well assess how you play alone and with others study the cognitive maps that may be tweaking your situation address the anxiety that comes from not having control in treatment fun creativity and spontaneity are an important part of the process we might have you choose an instrument you are unfamiliar with to address things in a new way or make use of improvisation every patient receives both a music therapy assessment and a medical assessment and we use every means at our disposal to help " its another sign of progress in the effort to shepherd todays musicians out of harms way mr isacoff is editor of piano today magazine and the author of "temperament how music became a battleground for the great minds of western civilization " see related letter "letters to the editor musicians can avoid crippling their hands" wsj feb
