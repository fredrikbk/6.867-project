the afternoon report houdini economy harry houdini freed himself from chains jails handcuffs and straitjackets big deal the economy just escaped from a collapsing housing market and a huge crack up in the auto industry and seems little worse for the wear the nations gross domestic product expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year economists suspected that growth could come in on the toasty side thanks to declining energy prices that spurred a fresh wave of spending by consumers but the reading blew away the average forecast of just a few months ago forecasters were moping around like debbie downer a survey of economists by wsj com back in october had the dismal set predicting just growth for the quarter as the housing cave in weighed on the consumer but robust reports kept piling up as the quarter progressed and it soon became clear that the economy was gaining steam housing carved a big chunk out of growth to be certain residential investment plunged by autos also took a whack out of growth as the governments statisticians finally caught up with the chaos gripping detroit if the slide rules were to be believed the wheezing autos sector had made a positive contribution to the economy in the third quarter but consumers kept on emptying their wallets at the mall and the trade deficit narrowed sharply meaning those problems were less damaging than they might have been economists arent sure that all this is terribly sustainable for one thing the fact that spending was so robust even as consumption of imported goods fell didnt seem to add up for example retailers like best buy and wal mart had said that the hottest holiday items were big ticket electronic gear like flat screen televisions and they are mostly produced overseas consumers have also been snapping up lots of fuel sipping foreign cars made by the likes of toyota "it is very rare that domestic consumption increases vigorously and imports dont " puzzled economist brian fabbri of bnp paribas a big surge in military spending also helped to fluff the numbers but corporate investment looked frail business outlays dipped as companies spent less on new equipment and software nariman behravesh the chief economist at global insight thought that development was potentially troubling but noted that the numbers can also be volatile so wait and see adding to the reports rosy surface inflation pressures piped down the reports measure of core inflation which excludes food and fuel costs climbed in annual terms that was slower than the year over year growth seen in the third quarter and it brings the gauge that much closer to the federal reserves inflation "comfort zone" of to that means the report as a whole with its picture of solid growth and only limited price pressure "was about as good as it gets " in the words of economist joel naroff but if growth keeps running this hot however unlikely that may appear given the shaky details inflation could pick up meaning that the fed will probably need to peel themselves out of the comfort zones beanbag chairs and start jacking up borrowing costs but for now rates are likely to stay put
