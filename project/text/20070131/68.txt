how bosss deeds buff a firms reputation gatess philanthropy puts microsoft atop yearly survey of best worst companies top ranked microsoft managed to beat johnson &amp johnson whose emotionally appealing baby products business had kept it in first place for a remarkable seven consecutive years in the reputation quotient survey conducted by market research firm harrisinteractive inc respondents gave microsoft very high marks for leadership and financial results but mr gatess personal philanthropy also boosted the publics opinion of microsoft "the involvement of bill gates and his wife in their charitable foundation has had a definite impact on microsofts reputation " says enriqueta lopez ramos a survey respondent and retired university professor in san benito texas "its hard to separate bill gatess image from that of microsoft to me theyre one and the same " social responsibility which is becoming an ever more critical component of corporate reputation contributed to the positive survey results for several other companies including whole foods market inc and merck &amp co in the latest ranking of of the highest profile companies in the world whole foods placed th and received the best score of any company for social responsibility followed by microsoft general mills inc united parcel service inc and j&amp j respondents praised whole foods as environmentally and socially responsible for its focus on quality organic products merck jumped six places to no as the publicity campaign about its assistance programs for the needy helped offset the negative impact of its withdrawal of vioxx from the market after the painkiller was linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes "prescription costs in america have gotten out of hand and i am happy to see a company try to help " says kathleen hamilton a survey respondent from waverly ohio who doesnt have insurance and receives eyedrops for her glaucoma free of charge from merck the corporate worlds overall reputation remains dismal with new scandals emerging such as the improper dating of stock option grants to business executives about of respondents graded corporate americas reputation as either "not good" or "terrible " just slightly lower than the in "at a time when being big is a bad thing it is important that companies tell the world they care about more than just their stockholders " says andria lickfelt a homemaker in springdale ark who gave sears holdings corp high marks for its sponsorship of the television program "extreme makeover home edition " sears "has taken a step up in my mind because every week you see a familys life changed on the show and sears is a part of that " to compile the ranking harris interactive conducted the reputation quotient survey in two phases for the first part respondents were contacted online or by telephone last summer and asked to name the two companies they believe have the best reputations and the two with the worst the companies mentioned most often were then rated online last fall by a second group of americans and each company was assigned a score and ranking based on those evaluations the companies were rated on attributes in six categories financial performance social responsibility workplace environment quality of products and services vision and leadership and emotional appeal a few companies that werent included in the ranking most notably amazon com inc whole foods lowes cos and berkshire hathaway inc scored particularly well in that caused some companies to drop in the rankings even if they maintained about the same score or even received a higher rating than they did in for example best buy co s score rose more than two points but the retailer still fell to nd place from th in even though it slipped to second place johnson &amp johnson scored very highly and still benefited heavily from the emotional connection many consumers particularly women feel with the company after using its powder shampoo and other products on their babies that baby halo continues to protect j&amp j from negative perceptions of the pharmaceutical industry regarding the safety and price of drugs but it is clearly microsofts year as mr gates demonstrates how much the reputation of a corporate leader can rub off on his company formerly chief executive officer and now chairman of microsoft he contributed to a marked improvement in the companys emotional appeal jeanie cummins a survey respondent and homemaker in olive hill ky says mr gatess philanthropy made her a much bigger fan of microsoft "he showed he cared more for people than all the money he made building microsoft from the ground up " she says "i wish all the other big shots could do something like this " to be sure some respondents still complain that microsoft bullies its competitors and unfairly monopolizes the software business but such criticism is less biting and less pervasive than it was just a few years ago overall the technology industry remains the highest rated in the survey followed by travel and tourism retailing and consumer products apple inc continued to climb in the ranking jumping five places to no with particularly strong gains in its scores for financial performance and vision and leadership some personal computer makers didnt fare quite as well in the latest reputation ranking including dell inc which fell to rd place from th dells overall score fell points a change of less than two points isnt considered statistically significant but it slipped more about points in the financial performance and emotional appeal categories "were focused on the future finding new ways to exceed our customers expectations and delivering best in class products and services " says dell spokesman david frink with many survey respondents commenting on the reputation damage from a highly publicized spying scandal at hewlett packard co the computer makers score for vision and leadership emotional appeal and workplace environment fell about points but its overall score was down less than a point the company tumbled seven places to no "dirty investigation techniques " a respondent commented "shame shame shame " an h p spokesman declined to comment on the survey some respondents questioned sony corp s legendary reputation for innovation and quality especially after the recalls of its laptop computer batteries when asked whether they trust sony to do the right thing if faced with a product or service problem said they "definitely would " compared with in "i feel that someone was asleep at the quality control switch " says sherri rase a survey respondent from edison n j who works as a sales representative in medical photography a sony spokesman says the company "is committed to delivering products that are safe and easy to use with respect to the issue of batteries last year we initiated a voluntary global replacement program for our computer manufacturing customers and additional safeguards have been added in our battery cell design and manufacturing process " the automotive industry was the only sector suffering an overall decline in positive ratings as troubled ford motor co and general motors corp plummeted to th and th place respectively toyota motor corp and honda motor co both in the top helped offset the negative perceptions of the u s auto makers scoring even lower than the automotive industry were the airline financial services pharmaceutical energy and tobacco sectors respondents scolded bp plc for oil spills in alaska caused by corrosion at its giant prudhoe bay field "i had thought their efforts to be better than the average petroleum company were laudable but now i dont think their beyond petroleum campaign is anything more than window dressing " says gabriel garcia a survey respondent and college student in pasadena calif says a bp spokesman "were confident bp will move up in surveys like this one as the actions under way to improve our operations and as our efforts to expand u s energy supply including major investments in alternatives become more and more visible " halliburton co finished in the cellar with respondents giving it the lowest ratings of any of the companies for ethical standards and for trust some people accused the company of using political connections to profit from the war in iraq and overcharging the u s government cathy mann halliburtons director of communications said in a statement "while this reputation survey measures the opinions of a small percentage of the general public its important to note that halliburton is an energy services company not a consumer products entity and the facts show that our customers shareholders and employees are very pleased with our services including our commitment to ethics and business integrity "
