repeal the martin act the road to albany might not be the road to damascus but dont tell eliot spitzer the scourge of wall street has been undergoing a remarkable public conversion since his election as new yorks governor mr spitzer has even recently established an executive panel charged with "rationalizing" the states financial regulations such concerns didnt inhibit his political ambitions while he was attorney general but theres a chance to do some good here if hes really serious governor spitzers task force called the new york state commission to modernize the regulation of financial services will suggest reforms to preserve new yorks place as "the financial capital of the world " an additional irony is that more than one of his appointees chuck prince of citigroup and martin sullivan of aig owe their jobs in part to mr spitzers campaigns against their previous ceos that said we hope theyll do more than take the governors dictation and in particular the commissioners should look at some of the laws exploited by mr spitzer when he was a prosecutor both a study headed by glenn hubbard and john thornton and another commissioned by mayor michael bloomberg and senator chuck schumer have played up the role of regulatory burdens lawsuits and arbitrary law enforcement in diminishing the competitiveness of new yorks capital markets a good place to start would be to repeal the martin act the martin act grants powers to the new york attorney general unknown in most other states enacted in it is one of the broadest anti fraud statutes ever devised and was designed to combat unscrupulous brokers and later used against some fraudulent boiler room operations but this "blue sky" law lay largely dormant for decades until it was disinterred by none other than eliot spitzer while he was playing the high octane ag mr spitzer used the martin act to assault financial institutions that became politically vulnerable in the wake of the business scandals and collapse of the stock market bubble namely several new york investment banks and mutual funds the act allows almost anything to be called fraud and in particular it doesnt require prosecutors to offer proof of criminal intent in court this all but guarantees a conviction if cases ever go to trial and its a major reason so many of mr spitzers targets pre emptively settled in combination with the acts pre indictment subpoena power and a press corps that lapped up selective leaks mr spitzer eventually forced the investment bankers to pay &# billion to resolve ginned up charges about conflicts of interest without admitting any guilt similarly mutual funds have shelled out over &# billion in fines and penalties since for the "late timing" scandalette theres nothing more "rational" than killing the martin act because it is a law that allows a prosecutor to punish or even ruin any financial company regardless of evidence or motive it is precisely the fear of such arbitrary enforcement that has caused the global ipo drain toward london hong kong and other financial centers perhaps his more elevated station is lending governor spitzer a new appreciation for the jobs tax revenues and wealth creation for which new yorks financial sector is responsible lets see if he and his commissioners mean it see related letter "letters to the editor martin act protects consumers investors" wsj june
