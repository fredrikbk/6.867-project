employment agreement with mr colby and other executives did say the company would have grounds for dismissal if it found "conduct which tends to bring us into substantial public disgrace or disrepute " mr colby built elaborate stories to keep his affairs secret the women who were involved with him say but evidence of them creeped at times into his professional life and also into the society pages of the indianapolis star wellpoints hometown newspaper and the accounts of several women suggest that at least some people in mr colbys immediate circle of colleagues knew something of his personal life rita dicarlo and jessica waugh say that mr colby made travel arrangements for them to meet him on business trips in the past couple of years ms dicarlo and ms waugh both say they met wellpoint

relations executives that he had bought book and movie rights to ms dicarlos story and that he had records of numerous emails and text messages between the two "our request for mr colbys resignation was not related to larry garrison" or his acquisition of rights to ms dicarlos story said ms troughton of wellpoint a former wellpoint executive who worked closely with mr colby following the merger says mr colby was a "superb cfo " who "knew his company facts cold" when he talked with analysts and also "knew the issues of the industry " he says he and others at the company had sensed mr colby had a complicated personal life but since it didnt intrude on his work "it wasnt questioned " they knew that mr colby had a family in california and another family in indianapolis "in indianapolis dave had pictures of this family in his office and in california pictures of the other family it was a pretty odd set of circumstances but we didnt discuss it in the office and i never saw him act in any way but respectfully to female employees " the former executive says five days before mr colby was ousted ms dicarlo filed a lawsuit in ventura county superior court seeking possession of mr colbys california home which she says he had promised to her and failed to give her on the day mr colbys dismissal was announced wellpoint received a subpoena seeking records of his communications with ms dicarlo when news of ms dicarlos lawsuit and mr colbys dismissal broke jessica waugh and her sister sarah who both live in california began comparing notes they both knew mr colby and each

with him that began in before the merger when he was finance chief of that company while she worked as an administrative assistant in the health insurers investor relations department she says mr colby requested that she fill in when his own assistant took vacation and that he would sometimes rub her shoulders and talk about taking her to dinner to thank her for doing a good job "we are unaware of any relationships mr colby may have had during prior employment " said wellpoint spokeswoman ms troughton drawing a distinction between the company before and after its merger with anthem "wellpoint health networks is not wellpoint " jessica waugh says mr colby wooed her and began a relationship with her in after she got in touch with him on her sisters recommendation to ask him for help searching for a job mr colby helped her get on her feet after her divorce and co signed a lease for a new apartment in southern california she says apart from a couple of brief breaks she says she and mr colby remained in a relationship until recently and that he had sent her to tiffany in to pick out a ring after his move from california to wellpoints headquarters in indianapolis in she says the relationships intensity waned though he continued to visit every five or six weeks and occasionally flew her to indianapolis "every time we had to stay in a hotel " ms waugh says "hed explain
