health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q regarding your article about golf health golf is a particularly difficult game and the fitness level vs the direction of the ball are hardly significant erratic golf swing equals weak core muscles how heavy is a golf club come on this seems like an advertisement for a golf clinic d n a my recent article about what your golf game might tell you about your overall health generated lots of mail most of it positive but i was surprised by several letters like yours from readers who were skeptical about the advice given by the golf and fitness experts i quoted one common theme from readers was that the biggest reason for a poor swing or bad golf game is lack of practice and skill obviously many factors affect a golf game including the golfers grip technique skill and practice time among other things that said short drives inconsistent swings and accuracy problems can also be caused by problems with overall fitness and flexibility in the american journal of sports medicine published a study that showed loss of flexibility in a golfers lead hip can lead to short drives and low back pain other research has shown that loss of flexibility and range of motion in a golfers neck can lead to accuracy problems and core strength has nothing to do with the weight of a golf club its about stability and focusing your energy in a way that generates power as well as accuracy and the golf swing puts tremendous stress on the back improving your core strength and flexibility reduces risk of injury a few years ago i spoke with university of washingtons paige mckenzie who now plays on the lpga tour back pain had sidelined her for months but after being evaluated by a sports medicine expert and a physical therapist she learned her real problem was a lack of flexibility in her hips and upper back as well as a tendency to reverse her weight during her swing she says that after months of a stretching and strengthening program the first time she picked up a golf club her swing fell into place and she could play without pain while the science of golf is still evolving there is lots of evidence that maintaining flexibility and improving core strength can not only improve a golfers game but can improve his or her overall health the study of golf health also holds lessons for nongolfers as well stretching and strengthening the body is essential for aging well both on and off the golf course q recently you wrote about a product called rit sunguard i have not been able to find it do you know how to get it v h a sunguard sold by phoenix brands of stamford conn is a laundry additive that washes uv skin protection into clothes clothes washed with sunguard block more than of the suns harmful rays which is similar to a sunscreen with an spf of a sunguard treatment lasts for up to washings the product has been evaluated and recommended by the skin cancer foundation it sells for &# a box which washes one load and can be found in craft and fabric stores such as michaels or joanns fabrics pharmacies such as walgreens also carry it its also for sale online at www ritdye com or www sunguardprotection com or you can order it by calling
