global economy euro zone officials debate tie between money supply inflation frankfurt with euro zone interest rates near a six year high european central bank policy makers are clashing over the role of the swollen supply of money in pushing up prices that rare break in the banks public facade of unity suggests policy makers are divided about how high to push interest rates in the nation currency bloc and it could rekindle a global debate on the merits of monitoring money supply broad definitions of money supply include currency in circulation such as cash in consumers pockets and retailers registers as well as bank deposits deposits in money market mutual funds and commercial bank reserves at the central bank years of low interest rates have fueled a global liquidity glut that has inflation wary central bankers world wide paying attention to money supply data the ecb as the only major central bank to give money supply growth an official role in its decision making has led the charge but other policy makers including at the bank of england and swedens riksbank have also cited strong money supply growth as a reason for recent interest rate rises with euro zone money growth hovering around year highs members of the ecbs member governing council are sparring publicly about just how inflationary all that cash is recent research from the french and italian central banks says fundamental changes in the economy from the advance of hedge funds to the increase in pension fund assets boost the figures so that record money supply growth poses less of a threat to prices than the numbers suggest such funds dont spend money on goods instead for instance they invest it in short term assets german policy makers meanwhile continue stressing that money supply helps predict future inflation that has some analysts wondering how unified ecb policy makers are in their quest to raise interest rates for the currency bloc beyond the current with the euro zone economy growing solidly many observers see interest rates hitting by the middle of next year "in some members of the governing councils minds there is a concern that the current recovery could still prove to be quite fragile " says james nixon a former ecb staffer and current euro zone economist with societe generale sa in london since the ecb says it uses money supply data to monitor longer term inflation pressures mr nixon and other observers say policy makers in slower growing france and italy may want to de emphasize the datas role in coming interest rate decisions france posted gross domestic product growth of in the first quarter from a year earlier well below the euro zones average italys economy grew in the quarter from a year earlier most central bankers believe rampant money supply growth eventually results in inflation but few set a specific goal for money growth thats because it is hard to measure and its relationship to overall spending often shifts the u s federal reserve is among the doubters fed chairman ben bernanke said in november that a "heavy reliance" on money supply data as a predictor of u s inflation was "unwise " the fed stopped publishing its broadest measure of money supply in march since the euros adoption in the ecb has said that annual money supply rates over flag inflationary dangers ecb president jean claude trichet says money growth far above that range at spurred the bank to raise rates in december when other data suggested inflation wasnt a worry critics have agreed the move was warranted and the bank since has raised rates seven more times still economists continue to debate the ecbs emphasis on money supply noting that consumer price inflation across the bloc has been benign even amid skyrocketing money growth euro zone money supply growth has outstripped the ecbs benchmark every month since june in april it increased from a year earlier close to a year high at the same time inflation has remained around the banks goal of just below last week the international monetary fund said that while euro area money is "growing at a brisk pace its relationship with prices is uncertain " now some ecb policy makers are also breaking rank a february research paper from the bank of france concluded that "the existence of a strong stable and predictable relation between money and prices in the euro area cannot be taken for granted " christian noyer who succeeded mr trichet as governor of the bank of france and sits on the ecbs governing council questioned in april whether market changes including the tripling of hedge fund assets over the past decade have boosted money in circulation without fueling inflation pressures such "money holdings are unlikely to generate an additional demand for goods and services " mr noyer said in april a bank of italy research paper said some of the record money supply growth could also be due to the growth of financial services firms such as pension funds and their holdings german policy makers who traditionally have attached great weight to money supply data have leapt to defend the ecbs money measure bundesbank president axel weber said earlier this month that money supply data "help predict future inflation " some analysts welcome the newly open debate "the ecb prides itself on being a very transparent central bank " says michael schubert an economist with commerzbank in frankfurt "so they should be open about the problems they encounter in their monetary assessment " others say the money supply data could yet play a prominent role in ecb policy making in coming quarters "if growth was to moderate somewhat " says jacques cailloux chief euro area economist with royal bank of scotland in london "it would not be sufficient to bring rates lower if overall liquidity continued to display unexpected strength "
