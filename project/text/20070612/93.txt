daimler benz ags mercedes benz unit ford motor co s volvo unit and porsche ag allow u s customers to take ownership of a new car overseas before shipping it home while the programs have been around for years on a limited scale targeted to military personnel and diplomats posted overseas theyre now being sweetened with extra perks and for an additional fee packaged with guided tours as all inclusive luxury driving vacations buyers in these little advertised programs often benefit from significant discounts savings typically range between and off the sticker price depending on the brand and vehicle and the price includes shipping in some cases the markdowns can be even higher billy brown an engineer in mobile ala bought an s sedan through volvos program paying about &# &# less than the &# a similarly equipped model would have cost at home a volvo owner since mr brown also took advantage of free round trip tickets to sweden and a two night hotel stay in the harbor city of gothenburg "i dont think id buy any other way now " says mr brown many customers are taking advantage of the more extensive travel packages offered at additional cost "the idea is to wrap the purchase of a vehicle in a memorable travel experience " says ron hennel a department manager with mercedes benzs program bmw mercedes benz and porsche offer touring vacations that play off the companies german heritage such as rally trips through the black forest and the alps prices start around &# per person buyers of general motor corp s saab vehicles can opt into the "ice experience " in which participants travel miles north of the arctic circle to spend three days in frozen territory highlights of the trip include helicopter dogsled and snowmobile rides as well as a test drive on a frozen

their local dealers who also help make travel arrangements to europe in some cases the packages include the cost of airfare to delivery centers scattered throughout the continent vehicles can also be insured and driven for weeks or months abroad before eventually being shipped back to the original u s local dealer by the manufacturer some u s customers use the programs as a platform for much longer vacations erik strom a year old currency trader in new york bought a new bmw i sedan for &# which he picked up in munich as an opening act to a three month honeymoon spent driving through eastern europe "this is likely the best kept secret in the auto industry even though its been around for years " says irv robinson who runs a bmw european delivery web site www edbmw com and is a salesman at motor werks a dealership in barrington ill that specializes in luxury brands it may also be a good way to get built to order or hard to find models mr robinson recently sold irina maron a northbrook ill real estate agent a new hard to find convertible through bmws program according to mr robinson ms maron years old saved eight weeks after ordering her new model ms maron flew to germany overnight picked up her car the next day drove miles to the drop off center and took the plane home the following day she took delivery of the car at home less than a month later in the u s she would have had to wait months to get the car "this is a first for me driving a car that nobody else has " says ms maron who adds that she plans to buy another car this way but next time she and her husband plan on taking a vacation package option yet european delivery programs may not be for everybody the time it takes for a vehicle to make it home can vary drastically depending on everything from its final destination to the demand for that particular model not all models may be available either such as vehicles assembled in the u s including some mercedes suvs and bmw roadsters and financing and leasing can be complicated if not gotten through the car companies operations another obstacle may lurk in the manufacturers own dealerships motor werks mr robinson says many salespeople are reluctant or simply misinformed about the programs "the manufacturers need a better training program because some salesmen are more interested in instant gratification and dont want to deal with it " he says still with asian manufacturers making concerted efforts to encroach on european luxury sales and with some american brands following suit these programs could become an increasingly important selling point some auto makers say that rising interest has caused some program managers to shun publicity until new delivery centers come online and capacity for european deliveries increases bmw will open a new facility to handle overseas deliveries in welt germany later this year partly to meet growing demand audi long the lone holdout among major european brands had so many clients requesting a similar service that it launched its own program late last year making initial deliveries in december bmw has the most popular program by far it expects about participants from the u s in triple the number of a decade ago a majority of whom are participating in the vacation packages volvo and mercedes benz delivered just over and cars respectively in saab which offers the most significant discounts and porsche which offers none at all report annual participation rates in the hundreds despite the relatively low volumes manufacturers say the programs are worth the effort because they help create loyal customers "they become brand ambassadors talking us up to their friends " says mercedes benzs mr hennel the mechanics of buying a new vehicle through a european delivery program are much the same as any domestic purchase all transactions take place in u s dollars and trim lines options and final prices are hashed out at a home dealership long before the trip begins all the vehicles come equipped to u s crash and emissions specifications and are packaged with standard domestic warranties at no extra cost those hoping to get their hands on models engines or technology options not offered in the u s are out of luck though european delivery is exactly that delivery in europe of otherwise u s bound cars vehicles not already sold in america arent available through such programs
