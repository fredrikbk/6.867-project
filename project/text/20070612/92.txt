surfing the wave of a fund fee waiver caps give reimbursement for part of start up costs but some red flags exist if you are paying more for your mutual fund part of the reason may be a lifting of temporary expense caps known as fee waivers fee waivers are supposed to be a win win for both investors and fund companies shareholders get a reimbursement for some of a funds start up costs and pocket more of its return meanwhile the fund company stands to gain assets by making expenses look more attractive "weve seen use of fee waivers inching up over the last three years although the amount being reimbursed isnt quite as much as in the past " said jeff tjornehoj an analyst at fund researcher lipper inc last year lipper found that of all diversified u s stock funds had some type of fee waiver in place for bond funds those numbers jumped to how long funds waive a portion of expenses varies by asset class fund size and even strategies within a fund family but most last at least a few years the average say industry analysts is anywhere from three to five years fee waivers are typically greater in younger funds in order to attract more investors firms will launch new vehicles by absorbing some of the early start up costs mr tjornehoj says "the intent is to keep investors from getting burned on expenses as a fund starts out " he said "it doesnt always turn out that way but fund companies arent trying to bait and switch their shareholders the nature of the business is to try to retain investors over the long term " still red flags exist mr tjornehoj advises investors to take a careful look at older funds still operating with fee waivers "certainly anywhere from three to five years is enough time to see if enough new assets are coming into the door to spread out expenses without relying on fee waivers " he said to be sure most fee waivers reflect a small part of a funds total expense ratio lipper says last year they averaged percentage point in stock funds and that has been falling in the past few years part of this decline is no doubt due to rising stock markets more new funds have been opened to take advantage of surging asset classes analysts say at the same time rising markets translate into less of a need to make fee waivers as large as in the past fee waivers "reduce your fees over the short term " said susan christoffersen a finance professor at mcgill university in montreal who has researched waivers "but you will see some firms consistently waive their fees and they dont ever go away they treat them more like a permanent part of the fee structure " in those situations it can be difficult to know exactly how to figure the true cost of fund ownership if the fund eliminates fee waivers the additional expense would eat into total return at just the wrong time says valerie antonioli a denver based financial adviser fee waivers on certain types of funds can place investors in more vulnerable positions than others ms antonioli adds for example small cap stock funds can be expensive to run since managers face a more fragmented and diverse market than large caps that tends to boost research and trading costs ms antonioli says the same can hold true for international stock funds ms antonioli points to a fund she uses for wealthy or "high net worth " and institutional clients julius baer international equity fund it is closed to new investors for some of her clients ms antonioli says she is using an open fund using similar strategies julius baer international equity fund ii "the original funds expense ratio started out very high at more than but they capped it " ms antonioli said "as assets have grown the funds expense ratio and fee waivers have dropped substantially " another fund she uses is growth fund of america saying american funds as a family has done a "good job of reducing expenses to investors as assets have grown " she says shed "love to see them come down even more as assets continue to swell at their funds " she also praises t rowe price group inc for judicious use of fee waivers at t rowe price a spokesman says that such practices are used only as a means to protect investors against unusually higher fees than category averages usually that is when a fund is first starting he adds
