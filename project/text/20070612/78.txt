politics &amp economics saudi affairs ripple in the west u k halts bribery probe but controversy lives the criticism britain faces over its decision to end a probe into alleged bribery of saudi officials by a british defense contractor highlights a problem in efforts to deal transparently with saudi arabia the country draws little distinction between government accounts and property of the royal family u s investigators say they examined some of the same washington accounts into which bae systems plc is alleged in british media reports to have paid to facilitate a year deal to sell fighter jets to saudi arabia but they found it hard to determine which payments if any may have involved wrongdoing and which may have reflected the nature of the saudi monarchy where funds belonging to the royal family and the government are often commingled british prime minister tony blair last year halted a probe into the bribery allegations against bae but fresh reports this month by the british broadcasting corp and guardian newspaper that bae paid millions of dollars over many years through secret payments to a u s bank account belonging to saudi prince bandar bin sultan have renewed intense criticism of mr blairs decision prince bandar who was saudi ambassador to the u s for years issued a statement denying the charges bae has repeatedly denied the charges the controversy over mr blairs decision has damaged britains image as a relatively corruption free country it has also been attacked by officials and anticorruption activists because they say mr blairs free pass to saudi arabia sets a bad example for other governments "the british decision to quash the investigation sent a very bad signal " said eva joly a former french magistrate who conducted a corruption probe into french oil company elf aquitaine in the s the controversy is likely to dog mr blairs successor gordon brown when he takes over as prime minister at the end of this month there is no indication mr brown will revive the bae investigation but he could come under pressure from parts of the ruling labour party to do so as a way of quickly differentiating his tenure from mr blairs the u s which routinely prosecutes companies and individuals for paying illegal commissions to foreign officials is also likely to object to the u k s handling of the bae affair and the closure of the serious fraud office probe according to officials familiar with the matter u s officials said law enforcement agencies or congress may go back and review bank records to determine the source of the funds to prince bandar the senior saudi continues to maintain considerable influence within the bush administration and is accorded great deference by top u s security officials renewed focus on the alleged bribery could also hurt bae britains largest defense company and an increasingly significant player in the u s the whiff of scandal could pose problems for future contracts with the u s defense department and for acquisitions in the lucrative u s defense market bae last month agreed to buy armor holdings inc a u s maker of military and heavy vehicles for &# billion the deal requires regulatory approval britains serious fraud office is continuing corruption investigations regarding bae in other countries including czech republic romania and chile swiss magistrates are also investigating suspicions of money laundering by bae through swiss bank accounts the deals in question date to when british and saudi officials signed the first of several contracts for the u k to provide military aircraft training and support for the saudi military bae has acted as prime contractor for the deals which have generated more than gbp billion or nearly &# billion in annual revenue and more than gbp million in annual operating profit for bae analysts estimate in mid prompted by media reports in britains guardian newspaper the u k s serious fraud office launched an investigation into whether bribes had been paid to saudi officials in relation to the so called al yamamah defense contracts bae has denied that it paid any bribes the probe was continuing in december when the saudi and u k governments signed a preliminary pact for a new aircraft deal valued at around gbp billion last december mr blair terminated the probe he said recently he didnt believe it "would have led anywhere except to the complete wreckage of a vital strategic relationship for our country in terms of fighting terrorism in terms of the middle east in terms of british interests" in saudi arabia it also would have cost "thousands of british jobs " if defense contracts were canceled in retaliation mr blairs decision to intervene in the investigation has caused the outrage but past experience suggests the investigators would have found mixed results u s investigators probing money laundering at riggs bank in washington d c in noted numerous irregularities in prince bandars banking activities but one investigator said in an interview that it was always difficult to determine whether these oddities simply resulted from cultural differences and the nature of the saudi monarchy on one occasion cited by investigators prince bandar ordered riggs to issue travelers checks for &# each and give them to an assistant the embassy later told riggs such checks "are often given to his associates for paying bills and reimbursements and are sometimes given to his aides as bonuses " some of the checks riggs investigators noted were cashed at the mgm grand casino in las vegas prince bandar received approximately &# million per quarter in his riggs account from an account at lloyds of london according to internal riggs documents and interviews with investigators it isnt clear who is the holder of the lloyds account in march the organization for economic cooperation and development an international body focused on promoting markets and democracy slammed britain for ending the fraud investigation the oecds country working group on bribery voiced "serious concerns" about the move implicitly rejecting the governments claim that the acts in question preceded the oecd anti bribery convention of the oecd launched a new probe of the u k s compliance with the treaty and noted the u k has yet to prosecute anyone for paying bribes overseas it has also repeatedly called on the country to update its antibribery laws oecd officials also say privately that the u k is violating the treaty by permitting its political officials to intervene in judicial cases david gauthier
