gasoline market pricing are mechanisms needed a june letter to the editor by jeff green stated that there must be a problem with gasoline market pricing mechanisms since prices are going up when supply demand and inventories are balanced i would ask mr green what "mechanisms " and should there even be any such "mechanisms" the oil companies and retailers should charge whatever the retail and commodities markets will bear period if individuals think prices are exorbitant then they will change their vehicles and driving habits market pricing is the only thing that will change our consumption of fossil fuels research the long term profit margins of big oil and compare them with other industries theyre modest when viewing long term moving averages mr green also states that "even a legislator can see there is a problem with gasoline market pricing mechanisms " i disagree with the premise that there is a problem read the history books on the historical economics of legislated wage and price controls this is a "solution" i fear greatly joel siegel fox island wash
