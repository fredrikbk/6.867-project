business day sign up for the e mail here the justice department countered the latest judicial rejection of its detention policies by reciting the alleged terrorist credentials of the detainee in question but in doing so the bush administration circumvented the focus of this and other courts unconstitutional treatment of the alleged evildoer not the man himself writing for the majority on a panel of the u s court of appeals for the fourth circuit in richmond va judge diana gribbon motz expressed indignation at the treatment of ali al marri a qatari graduate student arrested in peoria ill as a material witness in a investigation of and later declared an enemy combatant and placed in a military brig "for over two centuries of growth and struggle peace and war the constitution has secured our freedom through the guarantee that in the united states no one will be deprived of liberty without due process of law " judge motz wrote "yet more than four years ago military authorities seized an alien lawfully residing here he has been held by the military ever since without criminal charge or process " mr al marri hasnt been charged by the government with actually joining a fight against the u s she noted and has been held without constitutional defendant rights solely because the administration "believes that his military detention is proper " the court rejected government arguments that indefinite military detention of mr al marri was allowed under a statute governing the treatment of enemy combatants enacted years after his imprisonment and said that "even assuming the truth" of allegations that he trained with al qaeda the president has no authority to order the military to seize and detain him mr al marri can be returned to civilian prosecutors and tried like the oklahoma city bombers but "in the united states the military cannot seize and imprison civilians let alone imprison them indefinitely " judge motz wrote "we refuse to recognize a claim to power that would so alter the constitutional foundations of our republic " the justice department said it would seek a rehearing of the case by the entire fourth circuit and emphasized the danger to the public it sees in mr al marri as the new york times reports "in the summer of he met with khalid shaykh muhammed the mastermind of the september th attacks and entered the united states just before september to serve as an al qaeda sleeper agent and to explore methods of disrupting the u s financial system " the department said president bush it said will use all tools at his disposal to protect the country but other courts including the supreme court have rejected what the wall street journal calls an argument that "the president acted under the implicit powers suggested by both his constitutional designation as commander in chief and a congressional resolution authorizing a military response to " the al marri ruling and others "taken together send a clear message six years after the attacks the legal system has lost patience with government claims that it must dispense with traditional legal protections to guard against another devastating attack " the journal says gonzales vote falls short on capitol hill an architect of bush administration detention policies was himself under fire on another front where the white house has been accused of improperly usurping authority

opponents since the democrats had little chance of getting the votes to actually end debate on the measure which itself carried no force thus the vote was seen as a setback for the critics of mr gonzales who as the journal notes "has defied widespread predictions of his demise " but as the los angeles times reports the democrats intend to pursue investigations into whether mr gonzales and the white house improperly politicized the hiring and firing of u s attorneys as well as the national security agency domestic eavesdropping program he helped frame as white house counsel fords shopping
