divide and litigate president george w bush must envy franklin roosevelt although he faced a difficult two front war in asia and europe after pearl harbor roosevelt led a united nation the popular wartime slogans formulated as often as not by government information officers who would today be called propagandists emphasized political social and economic solidarity "together we win" emphasized a famous poster showing the hands of labor and management brought together by uncle sam those days unfortunately are long gone from the very beginning of the war on terror there has been strong and vocal opposition both to the war itself and to the bush administrations wartime policies this opposition has been celebrated and encouraged by much of the media and consistent with americas favorite pastime has increasingly taken the form of litigation in the courts the government itself has of course been subject to a blizzard of lawsuits virtually every aspect of the administrations war on terror related policies from the u s a patriot act to the use of military commissions to try captured al qaeda members for war crimes to the national security agencys terrorist surveillance program so called data mining no fly lists and related transportation security measures has been challenged in court on balance the courts have upheld the administrations actions or required relatively modest changes or additional congressional action in the case of military commissions significantly the supreme court has accepted the legality of the presidents adoption of a "laws of war paradigm " it is therefore not surprising that the wars opponents have shifted tack on may the american civil liberties union filed a lawsuit against jeppesen dataplan inc a boeing subsidiary specializing in air flight planning services in the federal district court in northern california the suit alleges that jeppesen provided air flight services to the cia as part of its "extraordinary rendition" program through which the three plaintiffs citizens of ethiopia italy and egypt were supposedly transferred to pakistani moroccan and egyptian custody where they were wrongfully imprisoned and abused up to and including torture the aclu case is based on the alien tort statute ats which gives the federal courts authority to hear civil claims for certain narrowly drawn breaches of customary international law its a real stretch as the supreme court stressed in its most recent ats case sosa v alvarez machain that law permits suits only where the alleged offense is firmly established as a violation of international law for which individuals are entitled to be compensated these are very few and far between indeed in the sosa case the court specifically rejected a claim for ats relief based upon the forcible abduction of a mexican physician wanted for alleged complicity in the death of a dea agent and his transfer to authorities in the u s the defendant in that case was far more directly involved in the alleged misconduct than was jeppesen assuming that the case is not thrown out because of the well recognized "state secrets" privilege as was a similar claim brought by maher arar a canadian rendered by the u s authorities to syria the aclus complaint should quickly be dismissed for failing to state a legally cognizable claim jeppesen did not abuse the plaintiffs it allegedly provided flight services such as flight plans ground service and weather reports to the cia agents who rendered the plaintiffs to foreign officials there is nothing illegal about that or about the practice of rendition itself this is a longstanding practice whereby one country transfers a prisoner to another country regardless of whether they have a formal extradition treaty extraordinary rendition in terror cases has in fact been a bipartisan practice used both by democrat and republican presidents beginning well before the attacks although it has strained u s european relations in recent years extraordinary rendition does not violate international law and this is true even where the detainee is rendered to a country with a poor human rights record in cases where there is a real risk that a particular detainee will be abused by the receiving state it is incumbent upon the sending state to obtain sufficient assurances as a condition of the transfer that the individual will be treated lawfully and humanely indeed despite the general condemnation of u s renditions by the european media and eu institutions a number of european states as part of their own post antiterrorism measures have sought to transfer or deport individuals to countries with human rights concerns based on exactly such assurances however transport companies like jeppesen are neither in a position to know the particulars of these agreements nor to monitor their implementation and are moreover entitled to assume that the government agencies they service are themselves acting lawfully leaving aside the lack of legal merit the aclus claims are part of a highly troubling new trend they are of a piece with a number of other ats lawsuits brought against government contractors actions filed last year against telecommunications companies alleging that they violated federally protected privacy rights by cooperating with the nsas data collection efforts and an action filed last march in minnesota against several airline passengers who had reported what they believed to be suspicious activity by a group of muslim imams the government enjoys legal immunities and other advantages in litigation that private citizens do not have moreover for a private individual a lawsuit however meritless can mean personal financial ruin and at a minimum significant disruption in his life corporations are similarly subject to costly and distracting litigation these are real advantages from an antiwar activists perspective since the result is likely to be a marked aversion by the citizenry in general and government contractors in particular to engage in conduct however lawful supporting the war this alteration in the corporate mind set such that risk averse companies no matter how patriotic their management would find it safer to say no to any war related requests from the federal government is very likely the goal of at least some activists divided nations can of course win wars throughout the civil war for example president abraham lincoln faced a vocal and determined antiwar effort in the north and both lincoln and roosevelt had to defend various of their policies in the courts even lincoln however did not have to deal with antiwar efforts targeting private citizens who were themselves supporting the governments war effort that is new and it will make fighting and winning the war against terror all the more difficult messrs rivkin &amp casey served in the u s justice department under presidents reagan and george h w bush see related letter "letters to the editor defending
