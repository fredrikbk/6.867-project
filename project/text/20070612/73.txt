politics &amp economics bush rebuked on combatants another court sees official overreach in antiterror policy washington in ordering release of ali al marri the last "enemy combatant" arrested and held on american soil a federal appeals court in richmond va joined a chorus of judges that have rejected the bush administrations assertion of extraordinary powers to deal with international terrorism although the administration has vowed to appeal the rulings taken together send a clear message six years after the attacks the legal system has lost patience with government claims that it must dispense with traditional legal protections to guard against another devastating attack "if the government accurately describes al marris conduct he has committed grave crimes " judge diana gribbon motz wrote in a page opinion but like others accused of terrorism in the u s including the oklahoma city bombers and al qaeda operative zacarias moussaoui he must face justice in the civilian courts she wrote "for in the united states the military cannot seize and imprison civilians let alone imprison them indefinitely " mr al marri a legal u s resident from qatar was a graduate student in peoria ill when he was arrested in december as a "material witness" in the investigation he was later charged with relatively minor offenses including possession of counterfeit credit card numbers and making a false statement on a bank application after months of legal maneuvers he was about to stand trial when president bush declared him an enemy combatant and placed him in military custody since then mr al marri has been held without charge at a naval brig in south carolina in a declaration filed with the court the government said mr al marri had trained in an al qaeda camp in afghanistan in the s met the terrorist networks leaders including osama bin laden and khalid sheikh mohammed volunteered for a "martyr mission" and come to the u s as a "sleeper agent" who would hack into banks to disrupt the countrys financial system in a decision the fourth u s circuit court of appeals flatly rejected the governments assertion that these actions even if true made mr al marri a military combatant rather than a civilian criminal as it has in other terrorism related cases the government said the president acted under the implicit powers suggested by both his constitutional designation as commander in chief and a congressional resolution authorizing a military response to those arguments have been rejected before most seriously in the supreme courts june ruling that struck down the presidents effort to establish military courts to try alleged terrorists without congressional authorization or judicial oversight judge motz adopted that reasoning and went a step further she wrote that the government had ignored legislation specifically designed to deal with such cases as mr al marris the so called patriot act the law allows detention of "terrorist aliens" for renewable six month periods if their release "will threaten the national security of the united states " the provision applies to aliens "affiliated with terrorist organizations" who authorities believe "have come to the united states to endanger our national security conduct espionage and sabotage" and commit other terrorist acts "congress could not have better described the governments allegations against al marri and congress decreed that individuals so described are not to be detained indefinitely but only for a limited time and by civilian authorities prior to deportation or criminal prosecution " judge motz wrote the government said it will appeal the decision to the full fourth circuit until that time mr al marri is unlikely to be released or sent into civilian custody the fourth circuits opinion has no direct implications for the nearly aliens held as enemy combatants at guantanamo bay cuba judge motz took pains to distinguish mr al marri from the armed belligerents allegedly captured on the battlefields of afghanistan but the decision comes just days after military judges at guantanamo in separate rulings likewise saw limits to the presidents authority judges dismissed war crimes charges against two prisoners because the president had no authority to classify them as "unlawful enemy combatants " instead they found a military tribunal must so rule before the prisoners were subject to trial before a military commission that limits due process rights the government says it will seek to reverse that ruling
