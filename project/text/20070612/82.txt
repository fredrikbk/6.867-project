putins missile gambit welcome to the fight vladimir putin thats the generous way to respond to the russian presidents surprising if also somewhat confused missile defense offer at last weeks g summit in germany mr putin wants to join the proposed u s led system for europe by substituting a russian radar in azerbaijan for the planned radar in the czech republic the underreported implication here is that in offering to help moscow is acknowledging what most of the rest of the continent figured out long ago that irans nuclear program and growing missile capability are a potential threat russians have long said this privately understanding that the war in chechnya could take a dangerous turn if iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad follows through on his promise to share the "islamic" bomb and missiles with fellow muslims but mr putins public stance has recently been that the proposed "third site" for europe is aimed at russia not iran even though the russians know that the system is designed to defend against one or two missiles launched from the middle east not against the thousands of missiles in the russian arsenal mr putins implicit acknowledgment of the iranian threat constitutes a degree turn the bush administrations immediate response to mr putins offer was to say it will study the matter to see if its technically feasible fair enough no one wanted to blow up the summit but as a strategic matter the appropriate response is already evident the defenses belong in europe not central asia the u s deliberations with the czech republic and poland where interceptor missiles are planned is a matter for bilateral negotiations between washington and two sovereign nations the cold war is over and moscow isnt the main player here this is a matter for prague and warsaw to decide countries formerly in moscows orbit are worried enough about russia letting moscow have a say in how they defend themselves would undermine eastern european confidence in american promises as a technical matter the russian proposal also looks to be a non starter for the simple reason that azerbaijan or turkey where mr putin suggests placing the interceptors planned for poland are geographically too close to iran to work effectively a long range missile launched from iran might be long gone before the system had a chance to pick it up on radar launch the interceptor and engage after studying the options for several years the u s chose poland and the czech republic for good reasons the private intelligence agency stratfor explains the decision with a baseball analogy "the polish czech facility would serve as an outfielder trying to catch a missile after watching to see where it is going the russians want the outfielder to stand in azerbaijan which would be essentially right next to home plate " ship based interceptors another putin suggestion are designed to shoot down short range and medium range missiles the proposed system for europe is part of the bush administrations vision of missile defense with a global reach it has been inviting russia to participate ever since it announced the u s withdrawal from the abm treaty in december u s officials have held numerous talks with their russian counterparts on what form that cooperation might take russia has potentially useful expertise in several areas including rocket engines and propulsion systems the u s missile defense agency will spend the summer evaluating the russian offer and theres a possibility there will be a useful way to integrate the azerbaijan radar into the u s global system its not however a substitute for the necessary facilities in poland and the czech republic see related letter "letters to the editor dont dismiss putins missile defense proposal" wsj june
