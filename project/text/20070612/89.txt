economys shakier regions when rescue lending fails the extra debt can make a bust just more spectacular among lenders that risk taking it on the chin are some hedge funds which have largely replaced banks as lenders in this kind of finance says mr derrough "to quote alan greenspan theres some irrational exuberance on the part of investors " how and when the credit cycle might turn isnt known but
