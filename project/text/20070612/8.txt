an ostrich farm takes wing again in south lebanon delicacies and handbags in mr yassines future hezbollah helps rebuild beirut lebanon not far from piles of rubble still being cleared after last years war with israel mohamad yassine recently took an important step in his own effort to rebuild middle east ostrich his first retail shop got ready for its grand opening passersby peered curiously through the window at his display of delicacies ostrich sausage ostrich mortadella and a basket of big ostrich eggs heat and eat ostrich cordon bleu and ostrich kiev were stacked in a freezer nearby souvenir plumes adorned a vase near the doorway before the war mr yassine planned a much larger business expansion than this storefront for now though it will have to do "the war was a disaster for us " said the year old mr yassine "were continuing on but we dont know how long well make it " thats a sentiment shared by many lebanese their hopes for prosperity so real last year were pummeled by days of fighting between the militant group hezbollah and israels military in july and august the aftermath of the war has brought political gridlock rising sectarian tensions and recently street battles between armed groups and the military last years war left deep scars on both sides in israel nearly hezbollah rockets landed killing civilians and damaging thousands of homes another soldiers died in the fighting many israelis were left feeling more vulnerable than ever in a hostile region lebanon took the brunt of the physical damage the southern suburbs of beirut and the rural south where hezbollah fired off most of its rockets and israels air force dropped most of its ordnance were devastated more than lebanese died mostly civilians and hundreds of thousands were out of their homes for months according to the international red cross the lebanese have spent much of the past year rebuilding drawing on funds from hezbollah the lebanese government and donations from countries ranging from the u s to qatar the rebuilding has gone slowly hampered by political paralysis in the countrys government and a sharp downturn in the economy though mr yassines business is unusual its the only ostrich farm in the country his tale of destruction and rebuilding isnt for a decade he had poured everything he had into building a flock of the african birds on a farm in maaroub in southern lebanon his brood numbered about when the fighting started mr yassine who wasnt at the farm when the israeli jets began streaking overhead phoned his son who was there mehdi yassine was on a summer break from the university of toledo in ohio where he is studying biomedical engineering the year old agreed to stay and try to keep the birds fed the bombing was so intense that mehdi couldnt leave the house most days he says on day he spread all the ostrich food he could find onto the driveway filled the swimming pool with drinking water and then let the ostriches out of their pens he and his father hoped the birds would forage enough to stay alive then mehdi took off for the relative safety of the north rebuilding started immediately with the cease fire that took effect on aug the elder mr yassine drove through an obstacle course of battered roads and collapsed bridges to get to his farm he was aghast at what he found of chicks in cages lining the farms long driveway just were alive and they died within days incubating eggs were ruined and six tons of fetid meat sat rotting in freezers long deprived of electricity adult ostriches wandered about the nearby hills and fields dozens lay dead some had been killed by shrapnel from the bombings others survived the initial blitz but were killed later when they kicked or pecked at the hundreds of unexploded ostrich egg size bomblets scattered over the property from israeli cluster bombs the controversial munitions are designed to spread smaller bombs that detonate through a wide area bomblets that didnt explode but that could at any time remain a major problem in lebanons south "we were surprised that any of the ostriches were alive " says zaki hussein a year old employee who helped mr yassine mohamad yassine had worked in construction in kuwait since he was in his twenties first as a laborer and then a contractor he saved money even while sending some back home to his family in he was hired by a kuwaiti to build an ostrich farm in that country he eventually became a partner of the owner in starting a similar farm in his native lebanon that brought him home his first chicks breed stock came from namibia in southern africa he says he poured almost &# million into the business it grew steadily especially after the israeli military pulled out of lebanons south in and the economy gained steam by last summer just before the war he had decided to take the business to the next level culling significant numbers from his flock to bring in some profits he rustled up several large orders in kuwait and cut a deal with a local poultry processor to produce frozen burgers patties sausages and other ostrich products but after the war he had to hire locals just to help him round up surviving birds some had wandered into villages two miles away mr yassine began piecing things back together as best he could he got more than &# cash from hezbollah to rent an apartment his home was also destroyed in the fighting and &# from the lebanese government to help him rebuild his home but to get his business back on its feet he has had to borrow &# from friends that helped him pay for the cleaning repair and disinfecting of the cages the united nations and hezbollah separately dispatched teams to remove most of the dozens of cluster bomblets on his land still ostriches that had eaten sticks and rocks continued to die for weeks after the war ended he says the females among the adult ostriches that survived have laid eggs so far this year he hopes that by next year hell have enough birds to begin culling them again for sale in significant numbers hes also making arrangements to go well beyond food hes negotiating with several local armenian leather workers to make ostrich skin handbags and backpacks and he hopes lebanons well developed soap and skin care makers can be talked into adding ostrich oils and salves to the wares they offer in stores here he has contacted artisans as far away as sudan about etching designs into ostrich eggs that would then be sold in art shops still the worsening political situation and rising sectarianism in lebanon are taking a toll on the business increasingly ethnic groups are staying within the areas of the country where their numbers are strongest when tensions have been highest for example thats made it difficult to keep up with ostrich orders in mountain villages populated by christians and ethnic druze lebanese "theyre scared to come down and were afraid to go up there " says mehdi yassine who plans to return to lebanon after he graduates in december to help his father run the ostrich farm still he says "we probably have a good chance to get back on our feet again if theres not another war "
