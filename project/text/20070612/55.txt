islamic groups nationwide use courts to intimidate critics floyd abrams "be careful what you sue for " editorial page june described how the islamic society of boston isb lawsuit against defendants backfired when depositions and discovery unearthed documents that showed the isbs claims to be false and a core concern raised by the defendants about links to terrorism to be justified the isb dropped the suit just before some of its important members were about to be deposed the suit against the david project and our co defendants which included a muslim sheikh who told the press hed seen hate literature in an isb mosque is a dot in a pattern islamic groups across the country are using our courts to intimidate critics and stifle discussion of the practices connections and intentions of muslim organizations the national review north carolina rep cass ballenger and the organization "anti cair" have been sued as well as passengers on a us airways plane who expressed anxiety about muslims acting suspiciously on their flight in boston news outlets that have been threatened with lawsuits have refrained from publishing letters and opinion columns about this case we stood up and fought to win a legal victory but mr abrams is right we need to reform the system so that those who bring frivolous suits and lose pay all the costs the announcement by the middle east forum of its new "legal project" to protect counter terror and anti islamist researchers and analysts is a most welcome development charles jacobs president the david project center for jewish leadership boston i feel reasonably certain that mr abramss enthusiasm for "the english system counsel fees to the winning side in cases like this" he means libel cases even though the english rule applies to all kinds of civil actions does not lead him to embrace the rest of english libel law english libel law still quite logically places the burden of proof of truth on the defendant who published the challenged statements in the first place and has consistently rejected the adoption of the u s supreme court created rules which turned our common law of libel derived from english law upside down it did this by requiring that all libel plaintiffs prove falsity and imposed a burden of proof of "fault" called "actual malice" on public official and so called public figure libel plaintiffs meaning publication by the defendant with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity to this daunting to the defamed party array of protections for libel defendants mr abrams would like to add another borrowed from our english cousins clearly mr abrams likes the potential "chilling effect" the english rule on counsel fees and costs might impose on persons who are considering their legal options because they believe they have been falsely accused and had their reputations damaged but such persons should not have to factor in the possibility of paying the defendants counsel fees because that never has been the american rule for any kind of case except a few statutorily defined categories and if i might return to the original wording of the aphorism "be careful what you wish for" mr abrams should consider the howls of outrage that would undoubtedly grace editorial pages all over the land when a losing media defendant has to hand over checks for both damages and counsel fees and costs to a winning libel plaintiff because that is the way the english rule works will he like the english way so much then john j walsh senior counsel carter ledyard &amp milburn llp new york
