energy rising costs for refiners delay expansion projects limited capacity could lift prices at pump for years the cost of building or expanding oil refineries is rising rapidly contributing to delays in increasing the u s gasoline supply at a time of near record prices the oil industry is blaming cost escalation driven by shortages of skilled labor and construction services along with higher materials prices for a spate of pushed back or scrapped expansion projects valero energy corp the u s s largest refiner in terms of the amount of crude it can refine has delayed expansions in quebec canada and in texas conocophillips has put off projects at refineries in texas and in louisiana while tesoro corp canceled the installation of new equipment to process cheaper crude at a facility in anacortes wash the decision to rethink construction comes as the industry flush with profits from high gasoline prices is under fire from congress and consumer groups in the u s for not doing enough to build capacity delays could expose the industry to additional criticism and unwanted oversight the average price of regular gasoline in the u s was &# a gallon yesterday up about three cents from a month ago and up from &# a year ago according to aaa formerly the american automobile association years of industry underinvestment have contributed to the current rise refiners in past years blamed low fuel prices and poor returns as well as environmental opposition to major expansion efforts and the cost of keeping up with fuel regulations in the u s no new refinery has been built since even today with prices high refiners are loath to build new facilities for those environmental and regulatory reasons as well as concerns that fuel prices might moderate long term instead the industry has invested in expanding or modernizing existing facilities resulting in gradual output increases meanwhile the big push for new refineries has been in the middle east and asia where demand for fuels is rising much more rapidly than in the u s some of these refineries plan to ship part of their output to the u s refiners say escalating costs threaten projects outside the u s as well conocophillips might back out of participating in a massive barrel a day refinery in the united arab emirates with international petroleum investment co of abu dhabi in april conocophillips chief executive james mulva said the refinerys costs were "challenging " and he questioned whether the houston company would participate the swiftly rising costs compound the industrys trouble in keeping pace with growing fuel demand world wide with demand soaring again the industrys attempts to catch up are overwhelming the engineering and construction capacities to build refineries as well as the global market for specialized refining equipment this couldnt come at a worse time for global consumers and it could keep transportation fuel prices high for years to come today despite high pump prices global consumption of gasoline and other refined petroleum products is rising paced by rapidly growing demand in china and other developing economies as well as continuing growth in the u s the energy industry already had been dealing with runaway costs for projects that extract oil and natural gas from the earth the causes were a scarcity of engineers as well as high prices for steel concrete and other basic materials this inflationary environment is now hitting the rest of the energy industry "all of you who cover our industry certainly are well aware of the rapid escalation in costs in the exploration and production segment in particular but it has spilled over into refining and chemicals " said rex tillerson exxon mobil corp s chairman and chief executive at a news conference following the companys annual shareholder meeting in late may u s refiners say costs started rising in and jumped after the hurricane season in as the gulf of mexico region absorbed much of the available labor materials and construction services for the repair of hurricane damage moreover refining companies are competing for resources globally "a lot of the skilled labor has moved on to other industries or other areas " valero president greg king said valeros costs for steel have gone up since while the cost of gulf coast skilled labor has risen mr king said the competition for labor and construction services has also resulted in a productivity drop of as the most skilled contractors take jobs elsewhere he added in recent years refining projects have sprouted all over the world amid growing demand for fuels the refinery related backlog of foster wheeler ltd an international engineering and construction firm almost doubled in from the year before to &# billion the bermuda based company warned investors in its annual report that as costs rise and "the delivery schedule of engineering and construction services lengthens clients may elect to cancel or delay investments until the market slows " still many projects are going forward "not every project is unaffordable " valeros mr king said this year the company finished an expansion of the crude unit at its port arthur texas refinery that increased capacity to barrels a day from valero is discussing plans to expand its refinery capacity in delaware city del by barrels a day marathon oil corp stuck to its plans to expand its garyville la refinery even though the price tag will be much higher than originally anticipated at the beginning of the company had expected the expansion to cost &# billion but it raised its projection to &# billion by the time the project was approved in november that year to deal with the global scramble for labor and materials marathon is looking to the future this year the houston based company organized a job fair to start recruiting and training people to build and operate its expanded facilities in before the ground in its construction site had been cleared the company ordered some of the massive equipment that will run the refinery earlier than usual "its a big project " said chris fox spokeswoman for marathon "you cant leave anything to chance "
