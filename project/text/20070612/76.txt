politics &amp economics house democrats face earmarks test washington house democrats rushing to begin floor debate on a new crop of budget bills face an old problem that haunted republicans before them what to do about spending items requested by individual lawmakers to curry favor at home beginning with a &# billion homeland security measure today the annual appropriations bills collectively represent a major policy statement adding billions to president bushs budget to strengthen domestic priorities of the new democratic majority but pork barrel spending trumps policy as the coin of the realm and new rules adopted after the scandals of the last congress demand greater transparency and accountability by democrats caught in the middle is house appropriations committee chairman david obey the wisconsin democrat who doesnt hide his disdain for the earmark process says he needs more time under the new rules to review the more than earmark requests received by his committee from lawmakers mr obey is a long time congressional reformer but in this case he argues that his committee and its staff are best able to protect the institution against abuses "the only real opportunity you have to prevent something stupid from happening is to have the protection of the staff who know the most about these programs and can fight something if they think it smells " mr obey told reporters "and they need time to do it " in a lengthy sometimes salty news conference he promised to make substantial cuts in the total number of earmarks this year and pledged to publish before august a full list of those his panel is prepared to include in final talks in september with the senate to avoid delay he is asking the house to vote first on the core budget bills which are being reported from his committee without any earmarks republicans are crying foul and accusing the majority of hiding a "slush fund" for future earmarks "democrats say lights out to hardworking taxpayers" read a news release from rep tom feeney r fla and mr obeys approach would also deny budget watchdogs something they covet most under the new rules a chance to force up or down votes on the merits of individual items when the funding bills come to the floor the first time "its a smidgen of transparency without accountability " said rep jeff flake r ariz with the senate appropriations committee poised to begin writing bills this week with earmarks attached critics are arguing that the house chairman should relax his hold and let the normal process proceed mr obey said the burden of the new rules is real however and the floor votes are rarely successful in any case since both parties vote their self interest and dont want to rock the political boat it would be far more effective he said to allow more time to review the requests and then respond in august after the list is published to challenges raised to individual items "i hate them i hate the process " he said of earmarks "but the fact is my preferences are irrelevant because the congress has a constitutional right to make choices on spending every bit as much as the executive " he also warned that he is prepared to pull the plug if no agreement can be reached on how to proceed "were not going to give the republicans the luxury of pretending they are against something they are for " he said of the spending set asides "if both parties cannot work without cynical partisanship exploiting this issue then as far as im concerned there can be no earmarks " together with senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd d w va mr obey agreed last winter to suspend all new earmarks for the current fiscal year ending sept but that was always seen as a temporary solution to expedite agreement on unfinished spending bills the white house after largely ignoring the growth of earmarks under past republican congresses has stepped into the fray by setting a goal of reducing the level of funds available for earmarks by almost &# billion in mr obeys own goal appears to be in the range of &# billion but unless some resolution can be reached on how to proceed republicans are threatening to obstruct the bills from going forward
