tattered justice on u s indian reservations criminals slip through gaps limited legal powers hobble tribal nations feds take few cases cherokee n c jon nathaniel crowe an american indian had a long documented history of fighting with police officers and assaulting women but the tribal court for the eastern band of the cherokee under whose jurisdiction he lives couldnt sentence him to more than one year for any charge not when he left telephone messages threatening to kill an ex girlfriend not when he poured kerosene into his wifes mouth not when he hit her with an ax handle "we put him away twice for a year thats all we could do " says james kilbourne prosecutor for the tribe "then he got out and committed the same crime again " indian tribes are officially sovereign nations within the u s responsible for running services such as schools and courts but a tangle of federal laws and judicial precedents has undermined much of their legal authority as a result seeking justice on indian reservations is an uneven affair tribes operate their own court systems with their own judges and prosecutors sharply limited in their sentencing powers they are permitted to mete out maximum jail time of only months for any crime no matter how severe the law also forbids tribal courts to prosecute non indians even those living on tribal land federal prosecutors can intervene in serious cases but often dont citing the long distances involved lack of resources and the cost of hauling witnesses and defendants to federal court in the past two decades only of tribal land crimes referred to u s attorneys were prosecuted according to justice department data compiled by syracuse university that compares with for all other cases the result many criminals go unpunished or minimally so and their victims remain largely invisible to the court system the justice gap is particularly acute in domestic violence cases american indians annually experience seven sexual assaults per residents compared with three per among african americans and two per among whites says the u s justice department the acts are often committed by non indians living on tribal land whom tribal officials cannot touch local prosecutors say members of indian communities have such low expectations about securing a prosecution that they often dont bother filing a report "where else do you ask how bad is the crime what color are the victims and what color are the defendants " asks mr kilbourne who has prosecuted cases on cherokee lands since "we would not allow this anywhere else except indian country " the lack of prosecutorial discretion is one of many ways in which indian justice has been split off from mainstream american due process for example some defendants appearing before indian courts lack legal counsel because federal law doesnt require tribes to provide them with a public defender although some tribes have them others cant afford to offer their members legal assistance its not unusual for defendants to represent themselves the indian civil rights act passed by congress in limited to six months the sentences tribes could hand down on any charge at the time tribal courts were seeing only minor infractions congress increased the maximum prison sentence to one year in wrongly assuming that the indian courts would continue to handle only misdemeanor level crimes tribal offenses meanwhile escalated in both number and severity with rape murder and kidnapping among the cases the supreme court weighed in on another level with its oliphant decision ruling that that tribes couldnt try non indian defendants in tribal courts even if they had committed a crime against a tribe member on the tribes land in its ruling the court held that it was assumed from the earliest treaties that the tribes did not have jurisdiction over non indians "if you go to canada and rob someone you will be tried by canadian authorities thats sovereignty " says university of michigan law professor and tribal criminal justice expert gavin clarkson "my position is that tribes should have criminal jurisdiction over anybody who commits a crime in their territory the supreme court screwed it all up and congress has never fixed it " jeff davis an assistant u s attorney in michigan who handles tribal land cases acknowledges that his hands are often tied mr davis is also a member of north dakotas turtle mountain band of chippewa "ive been in the u s attorneys office for years and both presidents i have served under have made violent crime in indian country a priority but because of the jurisdictional issue and questions over who has authority and who gets to prosecute it is a difficult situation " often cases dont rise to the level of felony federal crimes unless the victim has suffered a severe injury federal prosecutors have limited resources and focus almost exclusively on the most serious cases compounding that is the fact that domestic abuse cases are difficult to prove especially if the lone witness recants "it requires stitches almost a dead body " says mr davis "it is a high standard to meet " for some non indians tribal lands are virtual havens chane coomes a year old white man grew up on the pine ridge reservation in south dakota home to the oglala lakota near the site of the infamous massacre at wounded knee marked by a small obelisk the mass grave is a symbol of unpunished violence literally buried in the soil of the tribe the census documented shannon county which encompasses the remote and desolate reservation as the second poorest county in the u s with an annual per capita income of &# at the time only buffalo county s d was poorer according to local authorities mr coomes used his home on the reservation as a sanctuary knowing he would be free from the attentions of tribal prosecutors tribal police chief james twiss says mr coomes was suspected of dealing in small amounts of methamphetamine for years tribal police also thought he might be trafficking in stolen goods in mr coomes assaulted a tribal elder woodrow respects nothing a year old decorated world war ii and korean war veteran because it couldnt prosecute the tribe ordered mr coomes off its land but attempts to remove him were unenforceable "all i could do was to escort him off the reservation " says tribal police officer eugenio white hawk who did that several times the last when he spotted the banned man hauling horses in a trailer "he kept coming back after a while i just left him alone and let it go it was just a waste of time " mr coomes remained in his shannon county home until when he was accused of beating his estranged wife in nearby nebraska and threatening to kill her according to dawes county district attorney vance haug the crime was committed off the reservation and the subsequent investigation gave state authorities official jurisdiction after raiding his home they found stolen equipment as well as grams of methamphetamine and &# hidden in the bathroom along with syringes mr coomes is now in the fall river county jail charged with possession of stolen property grand theft and unauthorized possession of a controlled substance he also faces separate charges of assault and "terroristic threats" related to his wife in dawes county neb if convicted on the latter charges he faces up to six years in prison mr haug said mr coomess attorney declined to comment the jurisdictional quagmire also has implications for indian members on the other side of the tribal border gene new holy an ambulance driver on pine ridge had been arrested by the tribe more than a dozen times for various drunk driving offenses for which he received only two convictions totaling about a month in a tribal jail in state court four convictions would have led to a maximum sentence of five years lance russell the state prosecutor for shannon county and neighboring fall river county had never heard of mr new holy until feb when mr new holy got drunk at a fall river county bar according to court documents he nearly hit one car on a main highway forced two others into a ditch and sideswiped a third that had pulled off the road as mr new holy approached it in the wrong lane the last car he hit contained three tribe members cousins bart mardinian anthony mousseau and russell merrival all of whom died the accident was less than a mile off the reservation enough to give mr russell and the state jurisdiction in the case mr new holy is serving years in state prison for three counts of vehicular homicide much longer than the months per count he would have served under tribal law his attorney didnt return a call seeking comment "the holes in the system are more practical than legal and the victims of crime pay the price " says larry long iii the south dakota attorney general "the crooks and the knotheads win " the eastern band of cherokee located in the smoky mountains of north carolina is one of the most efficiently run tribes in the country its ancestors hid in these mountains while cherokee east of the mississippi river were forcibly moved to present day oklahoma a migration known as the "trail of tears " today the tribe is spread across five counties and is economically well off it takes in more than &# million annually from the harrahs cherokee casino &amp hotel which it owns and has a robust tourist industry about half of the tribes gambling spoils go to pay for infrastructure and government services its court which is housed in a prefabricated building looks like any other in the u s except the judges wear bright red robes the offices while cramped are modern and computerized and are a little over one hours drive from the federal prosecutors office in asheville tribal authorities meet regularly with federal prosecutors for training the tribes top jurist is a former federal prosecutor who has regular contact with his successors yet even here the justice system works erratically in tribal police received a tip that james hornbuckle an oklahoma cherokee who had moved to the reservation was dealing marijuana officers built a case for weeks they raided the business and then mr hornbuckles home where they found kilograms of marijuana packaged in small bricks by tribe standards it was a big haul and authorities approached the u s attorneys office gretchen shappert u s attorney for the western district of north carolina says federal sentencing guidelines for marijuana are so lenient that "wed need kilograms in a typical federal case" to pursue it the feds rejected the case if the state court had jurisdiction to prosecute the crime mr hornbuckle might have received a three year term instead he pleaded guilty to the marijuana charge and was sentenced to one year in tribal court recently the tribal council voted to permanently ban him from the reservation with backing from the feds messages left for mr hornbuckles attorney werent returned mr crowes name is all too familiar on the reservation tribal police chief benjamin reed has known him since he was a juvenile "what i remember is his domestic violence incidents he just wouldnt stop " mr reed says crystal hicks who dated mr crowe before his marriage says the tribal member was verbally abusive she says she left him after she had a miscarriage when he berated her for not giving him a ride to a motorcycle gathering "he said i was using the miscarriage as an excuse " says ms hicks years old after that in several telephone messages saved by ms hicks and her family mr crowe threatened to kill them and bury ms hicks in her backyard he was jailed by the tribe and ordered to stay away from the hicks family "one year " says ms hicks "he even told me he was fine in jail he got fed three times a day had a place to sleep and he wasnt going to be there long " after he married the violence escalated says police chief mr reed during one incident he drove to the home mr crowe shared with his wife vicki "he had threatened her and dug a grave and said no one would ever find her we believed him " mr reed said "just look at some of the stuff hed done that girl was constantly coming down here her face swollen up " at one point he choked his wife poured kerosene into her mouth and threatened to light it police reports say mr crowes attorney didnt return calls seeking comment none of these acts led to more than one year in jail a sentence he has been given twice since his criminal file at the tribal court building fills a dozen manila folders there are reports of trespassing and assault convictions telephone harassment threats and weapons assaults one for an incident when he hit his wife with an ax handle breaking her wrist his latest arrest in september came about a week after he finished his most recent sentence when he came home and beat his now estranged wife again after seven years his crimes finally triggered federal involvement although almost by accident federal prosecutors from around the country met at cherokee earlier this year to discuss crime on tribal land one federal official mentioned to mr kilbourne the tribal prosecutor a new statute that allows federal intervention where defendants have at least two domestic violence convictions regardless of the crimes seriousness mr kilbourne who was preparing for a new trial against mr crowe the following week quickly turned the case over mr crowe pleaded guilty to assault last friday and is awaiting sentencing
