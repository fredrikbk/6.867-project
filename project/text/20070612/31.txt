executives on trial in kpmg case the thorny issue of legal fees dynegys mr olis now in prison shows stakes in trial of accounting firms executives the federal judge overseeing criminal proceedings against former kpmg llp executives has been wrestling with a thorny issue how to ensure they get a fair trial given his finding that the government improperly forced the accounting giant to cut off payment of their legal fees for a vivid illustration of whats at stake consider the case of jamie olis a former executive at dynegy inc who is serving a six year term at the bastrop federal correctional institute in texas pressed by the government dynegy cut off mr oliss legal fees after he was indicted in on charges that he helped engineer a sham financial transaction at the houston energy company mr olis who sold his house as a result of his legal troubles says he was outgunned by the federal governments legal team which he believes led to his conviction late last month a jury in a civil court in texas ruled that dynegy improperly cut off his defense costs in a bid to avoid a criminal indictment of the energy company the jury ordered dynegy to pay mr oliss attorney who brought the case &# million in damages the company plans to appeal for mr olis years old the decision was a hollow victory a former midlevel accountant at dynegy mr olis was convicted in november on fraud and conspiracy charges for helping arrange a &# million loan disguised to look like normal corporate cash flows mr oliss original sentence of years was overturned on appeal with help from a high powered legal team his lawyers wont say who paid for the appeal but one expert witness said he testified at no charge mr olis remains in prison dynegy like many other companies had traditionally paid legal fees for employees caught up in company related investigations but as part of a broad crackdown on white collar crime brought on by the collapse of enron the government increased pressure on companies to cut off legal support for employees the justice department has since repudiated that approach codified in a document that became known as the thompson memorandum mr oliss criminal defense attorney said the lack of financial resources limited his ability to mount a strong defense "it wouldve made a difference " said attorney terry yates the government for example used computer programs to sort through million pages of documents produced as evidence mr olis couldnt afford the &# to print the documents the government had prosecutors federal bureau of investigation agents postal inspectors and accounting experts work the case mr olis found his attorney part of a three lawyer practice after his wife saw a picture of him in the houston chronicle getting kissed by a client he had successfully defended don degabrielle the u s attorney in houston says mr olis had "excellent" legal representation throughout his criminal trial and appeal "a jury convicted him and an appeals court upheld the conviction " he says a dynegy spokesman says the company "fully cooperated" with the government and "we believe we satisfied all our obligations to our employees " in january houstons then u s attorney michael shelby sent dynegys chief executive bruce williamson a letter expressing concern the firms cooperation in the government probe was "more apparent than real " mr williamson testified at the civil trial last month that he met with mr shelby the next day and "walked out of there a few pounds lighter " in a reference to the pressure he felt the government brought to bear on him mr shelby then sent a copy of the thompson memorandum which at the time detailed factors prosecutors could consider when deciding whether to indict a company rather than individual employees mr williamson said among them whether a company is paying an employees legal fees mr degabrielle who succeeded mr shelby said his office "followed appropriate justice department policies and procedures at the time " initially dynegy said it would pay mr oliss fees as called for in its bylaws even after he was fired in february but after mr olis was indicted that june along with two others the following month dynegys board passed a resolution placing his defense funds into an escrow account before and after his indictment and even after his conviction mr olis said federal prosecutors pressured him to accept a plea deal in return for testifying against others at the company he refused "what they wanted was for me to tell the story that i and everyone else engaged in a conspiracy " mr olis said in testimony from prison during his attorneys civil trial against the firm seeking his fees "i couldnt ruin those peoples lives im catholic and i cant do that " mr degabrielle said mr olis was offered a plea deal before trial and chose to exercise his constitutional right to go to trial two of mr oliss co workers accepted the plea deals his boss received a month sentence a colleague was sentenced to days mr olis was convicted in november his lengthy sentence became a flashpoint for harsh federal sentencing guidelines "i got a year prison sentence based on a transaction that my bosses told me to work on that i didnt make a dime off of " mr olis said at the civil trial brought by his lawyer no senior dynegy executives were ever charged in connection with the financing which prosecutors said was designed to help bolster the companys financial results and in turn its share price at kpmg the government held "the proverbial gun" to the firms head in forcing it to cut off legal payments for executives caught up in the investigation into the sale of allegedly improper tax shelters judge lewis a kaplan ruled last year attorneys for the former kpmg executives have argued that the fees are needed to ensure an adequate defense failing that they argued in filings friday that the judge should dismiss the charges because it would be impossible to undo the harm wrought by the governments actions the u s attorneys office in manhattan which is overseeing the kpmg case declined to comment judge kaplan allowed the defendants to sue kpmg for the fees but a federal appeals court overturned his decision now the judge is left weighing extreme choices he could dismiss the charges force the kpmg defendants to foot their own legal bills or hope the government comes up with a compromise judge kaplan has scheduled oral arguments on the issue for july
