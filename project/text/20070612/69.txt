notebaert to retire leaving qwest at a crossroads the man who turned a nearly bankrupt qwest communications international inc into a model of frugality is calling it quits qwest chief executive and chairman dick notebaert years old said he plans to retire from the western telecom company the announcement comes after years of heavy cost cutting and improvements to customer service in which mr notebaert even called in the unlikely help of shipping company united parcel service inc the results of all the activity qwest shares are up ninefold from when mr notebaert took over but as hes departing mr notebaert also leaves the company with a new set of sizable challenges after having decreased a crushing debt load the telecom company based in denver must now decide whether to ramp up spending on new technologies to stay competitive in the future and it is likely to continue to explore whether it can find a merger partner cable providers such as comcast corp are increasingly encroaching on qwests home turf and other phone companies are rolling out advanced new services like internet television under mr notebaert qwest was left out of the wave of industry consolidation in recent years making an unsuccessful bid for mci communications which was captured by verizon communications inc in recent months the company has been looking for potential combinations mr notebaert shopped the company to larger telecom providers with no luck people familiar with the matter say among potential acquisitions the company could go after would be embarq corp formerly the local phone division of sprint nextel corp some analysts say other possibilities include buying landline companies that serve mainly business customers such as xo communications and time warner telecom inc a qwest spokesman declined to comment with the departure of mr notebaert the entire team that engineered qwests turnaround will be gone last week the company said executive vice president of operations barry allen will retire at the end of this month chief financial officer oren shaffer retired in april qwest shares were down to &# at p m in new york stock exchange trading amid uncertainty over what the turnover in management means for the company the stock fell to &# after hours frank p popoff lead director on qwests board said mr notebaert wasnt forced out "hes put in five good years for us " mr popoff said "hes met all the expectations we had " mr notebaert said he would stay on until a successor has been found the company said a search is under way for his successor and said it has no timetable to complete it search firm spencer stuart is handling the hunt for a new ceo rival recruiters said a spencer stuart spokesman declined to comment people in the telecom industry and recruiters not involved in the search say potential candidates include embarq ceo dan hesse who could be brought in through a merger dick anderson a former bellsouth top executive greg brown president and chief operating officer of motorola inc and mike zafirovski president and ceo of nortel networks corp a spokeswoman for mr hesse said he hasnt been contacted mr zafirovski isnt interested in leaving nortel for the "foreseeable future " a person familiar with the matter said a spokeswoman for motorola declined to comment mr anderson couldnt be reached for comment one internal candidate who could be tapped is dan yost executive vice president of product development who has led the companys development of next generation internet and wireless services mr notebaert joined qwest in mid as the antithesis to joseph nacchio the former chief executive who recently was convicted of counts of insider trading he brought three decades of telecom industry experience to the table previously serving as president and chief executive officer of tellabs and before that chairman of ameritech corp a landline carrier that is now part of at&amp t inc when he arrived at qwest mr notebaert tried to rally morale among rank and file workers who survived the companys darkest hours touting the companys t shirts and other paraphernalia so much that he made the cover of "wearables business " a trade magazine on promotional apparel during his tenure he slashed thousands of jobs pared back benefits and reduced the companys debt by more than the company faced shareholder lawsuits and investigations as a result of accounting debacles of the early s and has since settled many of the disputes despite qwests makeover in recent years mr notebaert was careful not to declare victory "its nice to be almost normal " he said in a recent interview "but you dont want to ever exhale its always important to have some angst when you get up in the morning " in recent years mr notebaert turned greater attention to improving the companys once lackluster customer service in mid he sought out ups as a consultant to tune up qwests repair and service operations he thought qwest which dispatches its technicians to install phone and internet connections could learn something from upss experience sending out a legion of drivers to deliver packages among the changes inspired by the ups consultants qwest technicians began scheduling their days more efficiently with the help of computer generated routes eliminating long treks from one suburb to another between jobs and managers began closely tracking the quality and efficiency of technicians work sometimes even riding along with them on house calls the results qwest showed improvements in leading customer service surveys by j d power &amp associates and the university of michigan not everyone has been happy about all the changes at the company reed roberts a union official at the communications workers of america who represents about qwest employees in bargaining negotiations says the metrics used to track how well technicians are fixing internet and phone connections called "quality jobs per day" are unintelligible to many technicians qwest workers who have done say four jobs in an eight hour workday might get a score of quality jobs a day based on feedback from customers about whether a job was done quickly and correctly among other factors the company acknowledges that the new accountability might be a point of friction with some workers "not everybody is excited about it but people understand it " says qwest spokesman jon lentz if belt tightening was the first phase of qwests turnaround the second phase will be much trickier as cable operators like comcast plow onto qwests turf in places like denver seattle and portland ore both companies offer a "triple play" of phone internet and video services for around &# a month comcasts footprint already overlaps with of qwests households says donna jaegers a telecom analyst with janco partners qwest "is at a crossroads right now " she says "they are really facing an increasing amount of competition " to compete with cable providers at&amp t and verizon have been investing billions in network upgrades to offer higher speed internet service as well as their own television service both companies also operate their own wireless networks for now qwest offers tv and wireless services through reselling arrangements with satellite provider directv group inc and sprint nextel respectively ms jaegers says that strategy has worked so far but it wont allow the company to generate the same margins as other telecom providers in the long run mr notebaert has said he would invest in internet based on demand tv programming in markets where customer demand materializes in the next few years the challenge will be to upgrade qwests broadband infrastructure while keeping the companys overall capital expenses which are the lowest of all major carriers at of revenue relatively flat today only about of qwests customers can get the megabit per second web speeds that would be required for internet television "were spending our money on what customers want and at the pace they want it " mr notebaert said in a recent interview dionne searcey and li yuan contributed to this article
