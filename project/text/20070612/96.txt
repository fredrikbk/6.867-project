the evening wrap gazas downward spiral online edition the fighting between rival palestinian factions in gaza city has gone from bad to worse in recent days prompting onlookers to worry about the prospect of a civil war that could also divide the broader middle east hamas gunmen captured the headquarters of fatah controlled security forces in northern gaza late today in fighting that the fatah aligned president mahmoud abbas said amounted to a coup attempt by the islamist party and which left the fragile palestinian coalition government dangling by the thinnest of threads fatah commanders complained that they hadnt been given clear orders to fight back at a time when hamas seemed highly organized and determined to take over the security compound a key lever of power "there is a weakness of our leaders " col nasser khaldi said "hamas is just taking over our positions " officials said at least people had been killed and that others were hurt in todays fight hamas seemed to view the taking of the security post as a decisive move prime minister ismail haniyeh "urges restraint and an end to this chapter of conflict an immediate return to the negotiating table and an end to sedition " said an aide reading from a statement fatahs central committee said late today that its ministers will suspend participation in the government until the fighting stops while fatah forces were ordered into the streets escalating the fight hamas and fatah have been at odds ever since hamass surprising victory at the polls in january the parties reached an uneasy power sharing pact earlier this year but just who controls the palestinian security services has remained a point of tension and the two factions have never really coalesced into anything that resembles a functioning coalition government street violence between the groups has persisted and in recent days it has turned especially brutal roughly deaths have been reported since the weekend a terrifying shootout unfolded in a gaza hospital a fatah security official was hauled out of his home and shot execution style by hamas militants and some were thrown to their deaths from the top of high rise buildings the fighting has left many regular citizens hiding inside their homes and even the most high ranking officials in the government have had their brushes with it mr haniyehs gaza home was struck today by a rocket propelled grenade and mr abbass home was hit by four mortal shells neither leader was harmed in the separate incidents nor were family members but the attacks underscore how hard the fighting is to escape and why so many leaders around the world are watching developments with increasing unease the european union believes that if the fighting continues theres a good chance a full blown civil war will ensue u n secretary general ban ki moon urged other leaders to show support for mr abbass push to "restore law and order " while israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that an international force should be stationed along the gaza egypt border in order to choke off the flow of money and weapons to the "extremist forces " israel has recently said it believes hamas which has been firing rockets into israeli territory is building up a large stockpile of weapons but israel doesnt plan to intervene in the fight on behalf of fatah meanwhile lebanon was continuing to battle with militants inspired by al qaeda at a palestinian refugee camp lebanons army fired heavy artillery rounds into the camp and the army reported that it was "tightening the noose" on the militants but
