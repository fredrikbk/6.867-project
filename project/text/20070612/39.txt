global economy korean shipbuilders take novel construction tack booming business inspires new methods to make boats thinking outside the dock ulsan south korea two years ago hyundai heavy industries co the worlds largest shipbuilder had a problem business was booming so much that its nine dry docks the huge bathtub like structures near ports where ships are normally built were completely booked for several years but the company didnt want to pass up the chance to take in more orders hyundai engineers came up with a solution a radical new construction method rather than use dry docks which can be flooded to float a newly built vessel out into navigable water they would build ships entirely on dry land in designing the new process they confronted a major logistical challenge how to get the huge and heavy finished vessels off land and out to sea the companys engineers rose to the challenge figuring out how to lift an oceangoing ship onto a barge that could transport it to deep water the trickiest part came when the vessel sometimes the size of a story building but without a stable base first comes in contact with the barge one mistake and the costly metal hulk could topple over the new approach to shipbuilding is a byproduct of the strong global economy shipbuilders especially in asia are enjoying their biggest bonanza ever with orders stretching out three to four years even further ahead than in the s when the booming trade in oil led to a surge in tanker demand todays demand is being shaped by chinas appetite for raw materials and the increase in global trade shipping lanes are getting busier not just from asia to north america and europe but within asia particularly to india and to south america ship prices have risen since as calculated by clarkson a london based shipping broker and research firm the order backlog is valued at &# billion or nearly four years worth of work "its really been a sellers market " says christian waldegrave an analyst at clarkson "the prices are at all time highs " the big shipbuilders fear that if they dont expand customers will be put off by the long wait and walk away as it is fast growing chinese shipbuilders many of them state sponsored are nipping at the heels of the market leaders in korea and japan but expansion in the shipbuilding industry is always risky the scale of operations and manpower is so huge and demand is almost entirely tied to forces beyond the industrys control in for example the industrys overall order backlog fell quickly to two years from four as the energy crisis hit it took more than a decade for the industry to recover today shipbuilders are scrambling to meet orders in korea and japan they have revamped ship repair yards into shipbuilding sites and started building new yards in lower cost nations like china and the philippines korean conglomerate daehan group is transforming a small town on koreas southwest coast by spending &# billion on a new shipyard and related facilities there over the next four years though its first dry dock wont be finished until next month the company is already building parts for its first ship and has orders for more "we dont think this can be called a gamble " says park jae yeong vice chairman of daehan shipbuilding co shipbuilders have also shortened production cycles by adopting some of the parts outsourcing and other techniques refined by the electronics and automotive industries over the past decade many giant ships now come together in just four weeks in a dry dock down from just a few years ago but the industrys boldest step was to think outside the dock altogether the first company to do it stx shipbuilding co solved the problem of getting the ship from land to water by building a pulley system into the ground at its shipyard in jinhae korea three years ago now the company builds a ship in two halves above the system when done the halves still propped up on their supports are placed on wheels pulled onto a barge with pulleys and welded together then the barge travels a short distance to the nearby port and partially sinks allowing the new ship to float free the technique frees ships from the tight constraints of a dry dock allowing them to be built in bigger sections that means less work for cranes and fewer connections for welders and pipe fitters "if you look at the dry dock everything has to be transferred by crane " says lee soo jeung vice president of production at stx "now we can make bigger blocks and use other transporters to move them around its a very big difference " of the ships stx plans to build this year will be built on land and it will build even more next year by adding a second pulley system stxs method involves orienting the ship so it is perpendicular to the waterline and sliding it onto a barge that is as long as the ship at hyundai heavy about miles up the coast here in ulsan the company builds a ship parallel to the waterline and skids it along onto a barge using air pressure as if the ship were the plastic puck in an air hockey game before building the first ship this way hyundai heavy engineers needed to show customers the ship wouldnt bend too much during the transfer they calculated each end would be about inches lower than the center less than the inches that most oceangoing ships are designed to bend in normal use oh byung wook senior executive vice president at hyundai heavy says customers needed persuading at first "we had to prove our calculations were precise " he said when they transferred the first land built ship to a barge in late they stopped every inches for sensors lasers and computers to measure the balance and pressure on the vessel and barge they found their bending estimate was off by a mere inch lina yoon
