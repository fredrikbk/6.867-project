health savings plans start to falter despite employer enthusiasm for consumer directed approach patients express dissatisfaction with how the accounts work president bush and many big employers have hailed "consumer directed" health plans and savings accounts as an effective weapon in the battle against runaway medical costs but several years after the plans got off to a fast start the approach appears to be stumbling largely because of consumers unease in using them eight million to million americans are enrolled in consumer directed plans which involve a high deductible insurance policy that can be combined with a savings account to help pay for out of pocket health costs the plans which have lower premiums but shift more of the responsibility for health care spending onto consumers got a big boost in late after congress created portable health savings accounts that participants can use to sock away pretax dollars and let them grow tax free employers often put money in the accounts to subsidize the higher deductibles the plans are accomplishing some of what they intended a raft of data show that people enrolled in the plans do tend to spend less on care than others that is encouraging more employers to introduce such plans to their workers over the next two years but low enrollment and low satisfaction among workers who are offered them raise the question of whether consumer directed plans will stall before they ever hit the mainstream few employers are focusing on the costly measures such as offering better coverage or more consumer education that may be needed to accelerate these plans the numbers of u s workers enrolled in such plans through their jobs excluding dependents and those in firms with fewer than three workers grew only slightly to million in from million in according to the kaiser family foundation most do it because either their companies give them no choice or the premiums are the cheapest enrollment is growing faster on the individual market and among sole proprietors but that may be because the plans are often the only affordable option where employees do have a choice only choose the newfangled plans the kaiser study estimates in the federal employees health benefits program which has offered the plans for several years only about of its eight million members were enrolled in them in according to industry estimates at lightbulb maker osram sylvania just of employees enrolled in the plans in their first year in addition those who are in consumer directed health plans often report lower satisfaction and confusion about how the plans are supposed to work the general idea is for patients to conserve money in their savings accounts which are meant to pay for care until they reach their high insurance deductible in theory patients who shop carefully could have money left over which they can keep and let build into savings for bigger health care costs down the line in a survey published last month by towers perrin an employee benefits firm employees enrolled in them said they felt less capable of finding a quality doctor or hospital though they often were in the same network as colleagues in other plans only said they tried to save money in their accounts for future medical expenses though the consulting firm says consumer directed plans have much potential its executives were surprised consumer responses were so negative "if i were a product manager in any other industry and saw scores this low in customer satisfaction and understanding id be thinking of pulling that product from the shelves or retooling it " says david guilmette managing director of towers perrins health care consulting practice one reason for the frustration is the uphill battle many consumers describe in trying to shop for their health care six years ago howard katz an industrial design research consultant in rural eastern pennsylvania bought a family health plan with a savings account and a deductible that is now &# but getting specific price information on which to base purchase decisions for mris doctor visits and blood work has been difficult he says and the money in the health savings account gets spent only once has enough remained to roll over to the next year now he says he has rejoined a company as an employee after working on his own and one of the perks is regaining traditional health coverage "now i dont have to act like a medical examiner anymore " he says proponents of consumer directed plans point out that their overall enrollment continues to grow at a faster clip than enrollment in hmos did when they were introduced in the s among those who enroll the vast majority stay in and dont switch back to another type of plan in cases where employers spend months informing workers about how the plans work and offer them more financial incentives than just cheaper premiums workers report higher satisfaction and often get more preventive care than people in other plans "but the vast majority of companies still do not have the time effort or resources to prime the pump " says larry boress president of the midwest business group on health a coalition of large employers a growing number of industry experts believe that for consumer directed plans to succeed they have to offer coverage that is at least as rich as traditional plans that means providing upfront coverage of most preventive services and treatments and a generous contribution to employees accounts "if youre just trying to cost shift and you only get of your employees in they are the youngest and healthiest and you havent accomplished anything in terms of health care costs " says bill sharon a senior vice president at aon consulting the human resources consulting arm of insurance broker aon corp osram sylvania introduced a consumer directed health plan with a health savings account with premiums to cheaper than its traditional plans but employees were responsible for the entire deductible just of employees enrolled in preparation for it introduced another similar plan alongside it but with preventive care coverage and a &# contribution into the health reimbursement account and older generation of the health savings account "wed heard concerns from employees that they werent going to get the right care " says julie thibodeau co director of human resources at osram sylvania this year enrollment between the two consumer directed plans rose to aon has offered its own employees two consumer directed options since with deductibles between &# and &# nearly of employees are enrolled in one and the majority of them have money left to roll over from the &# to &# that aon contributes to their account each year employee premiums are about lower than in the more traditional plans aon offers says john reschke aon corp s vice president of benefits considering that the coverage is at least as rich for most employees as in the traditional plans "we should have a lot more people enrolled " he says "but this is a different kind of insurance and it can be scary at first until people understand " speed bump enrollment in consumer driven health plans number of u s workers excluding dependents enrolled in such plans through work was million in vs million in  of employees in a consumer directed plan say it was the only choice available from their employer where employees have a choice of health plan options only choose consumer driven plans source the kaiser family foundation see related letter "letters to the editor consumer driven plans for health care can work" wsj
