huddled classes yearning to learn free demand for no cost lessons could explode if congress requires english proficiency queens community house in jackson heights n y doesnt advertise its free english courses but for many years its lotteries for places in the class drew hordes that required police presence a new system has eliminated the crowds and the need for cops but competition for spaces remains fierce three out of four interested applicants are turned away "people plead and cry on the day the names are posted " says director k c williams an year veteran of english language programs "you cannot imagine how much these immigrants want to learn english demand is off the charts " and demand for english instruction is likely to explode in coming years an immigration bill now stalled in the senate would require million illegal immigrants to show proficiency in english in order to qualify for legal permanent residency or a green card president bush will meet with senate republicans today to try to jump start the bill but even if that effort fails any future immigration legislation is expected to require proficiency in english the majority of undocumented immigrants are believed to have limited english or lack english altogether yet already providers cant keep up with demand because of a dearth of publicly funded classes across the u s "the problem is not the unwillingness of immigrants to learn english " says chung wha hong executive director of the new immigration coalition an advocacy group "the problem is we dont provide enough classes " the cost of attending private language centers is out of reach for most new immigrants since the s programs that teach english as a second language esl have been funded through the federal governments adult education program as well as money from states and municipalities typically immigrants attend classes at community centers libraries and nonprofit organizations that compete for public funds each year immigrant resettlement organizations such the united jewish appeal offer esl programs using private philanthropy and some public funds religious organizations sometimes offer english classes taught by volunteers immigrants normally attend for free or pay only a nominal fee but amid a record influx of immigrants to the u s there are not enough seats in these courses to meet exploding demand for the fiscal year ended june there were million esl students enrolled in programs backed by public funds a survey conducted last year by the national association of latino elected officials educational fund of esl providers in cities found that maintained waiting lists in phoenix the states largest provider had a waiting list of more than people with waiting times of up to months for evening classes in boston at least adults were on waiting lists some of them for three years in albuquerque providers reported waiting times of up to months in new york city most esl programs no longer keep waiting lists due to huge demand to close the gap in recent years there has been a proliferation of private esl programs offered by colleges and language schools however private instruction which can cost up to several thousand dollars per semester is out of reach for most working class newcomers some employers including many hospitals offer on site english training for their foreign workforce however by and large u s companies dont provide or finance english classes for their employees thus programs administered with public funds are likely to represent the lions share of all esl seats for the foreseeable future experts say "the government and private sector should work together to increase capacity " says elyse rudolph executive director of the literacy assistance center a hub of technical assistance and training for adult education programs in new york state opponents say the u s government shouldnt be in the business of paying language instruction for immigrants "we dont agree with the idea that the government owes it to them to pay for their english proficiency " says ira mehlman a spokesman for the federation for american immigration reform as fair sees it he says exploding demand for english classes is an indication that "the flow of immigration needs to slow down " some politicians radio talk show hosts and anti immigrant groups express concern that the swelling ranks of spanish speakers whom they perceive as not wanting to learn english are diluting u s culture according to the u s census bureau million residents less than report speaking english "less than very well " since the s several states have passed "english only" laws designed to assert the dominance of english last week the senate passed an amendment to the immigration bill making english the countrys "national language " opponents called the measure demeaning and said they would try to kill it the primary federal source for esl programs is through title ii of the workforce investment act for adult education and literacy despite ballooning demand the allocation hasnt kept pace having stagnated at &# million for the last three years in the bush administration proposed scaling back funding to &# million for the fiscal year state education officials fought back averting the cut but they say the episode highlights the fragile nature of federal support new york states immigrant population has grown by nearly million since to about four million today yet esl programs added only new seats over the same period about adults in the state are enrolled last year the state allocated &# million to adult education which includes esl classes about the same as in including the federal funds which states disburse to teaching centers but the federal contribution has dropped forcing states to pick up a bigger share of the tab new york city is home to nearly three million foreign born residents and that population is expected to keep climbing "we figure were serving just of the need" for english classes says ms rudolph of the literacy assistance center although the general public sometimes assumes that newcomers can learn english by carrying out their daily activities experts estimate that between and hours of instruction are needed to master basic english verbal and literacy skills typically a student enrolls for one year taking three cycles of hours each with the average class being hours per week immigrants are expected to account for most of the growth in the u s work force over the next two decades and to be key to the countrys economic health research has indicated that knowledge of english is closely correlated with professional success and socioeconomic advancement a study by the national assessment of adult literacy found that median weekly earnings of proficient english speakers were higher than those at a below basic level students at the queens community house which occupies several rooms in an office building near henna tattoo shops halal butchers and other ethnic businesses hail from more than countries but about of the students are native spanish speakers reflecting the booming numbers of latin american immigrants to new york rosa maria cossio a year old immigrant from colombia succeeded in her third attempt to win a spot in an english course there currently she works tending to a child with special needs after completing the fifth and last english level she plans to have enough english to enroll in a nursing course "you know without english you dont go far in this country " says mrs cossio her husband who is a barber
