arbiter confirms that in fact most private equity firms hardly function as a partnership of equals instead a small circle of founders control a disproportionate share of the firm while most partners are left sparring for their cut of the rest for example at tpg the former texas pacific group founders david bonderman and jim coulter own most of the firm and when they bought out the third founding partner bill price last year most of his equity went back to the remaining two blackstone executives tried to avoid an internal battle between the haves the have lesses and the have nots that was complicated by mr schwartzmans penchant for taking big cuts of the firms profits no founder of any of the major private equity firm had ever kept as much of the equity in the firm as mr schwarzman according to numerous people familiar with the matter and that alienated some former blackstone executives these people said this time both mr schwarzman and mr james were determined that the process satisfy everyone including talented young people the firm wanted to retain mr james suggested distributing the firms equity as democratically as possible according to people who were briefed on the matter he told associates that this would avoid resentments these people say blackstone executives consulted with executives at goldman sachs group inc for tips on how to avoid internal dissension over money one result blackstone like goldman eventually set aside billions of dollars to reward nonpartners in a bid to keep future stars at the firm content blackstone executives declined to comment on the filing the securities and exchange commission imposes a quiet period before an ipo the division of the spoils became easier when the value of the company became clear early in the ipo process blackstones investment bankers put a valuation on the firm but messrs schwarzman and james believed the number was too high according to people familiar with the matter but the january listing of alternative investment firm fortress investment group llc confirmed just how valuable their business was likely to be still the negotiation over shares was intense these people add blackstone has adopted a complicated formula that commits most principals to hold the bulk of their shares for as long as eight years to ensure that they dont leave after their firm goes public and while senior managing directors all receive a &# salary the bulk of what they take home remains tied to investment performance to keep their interests aligned with those of the public shareholders it is mr schwarzman and mr james to whom potential investors will look for future performance since mr james joined blackstone turnover among blackstone staffers has slowed greatly mr peterson has been less active in the firm in the past several years and will formally sever his relationship with blackstone next year for his part mr peterson himself has told outsiders "i have reduced my shares on my own i never wanted a situation where the younger people at blackstone would feel they missed it " mr peterson plans to devote much of his time and his wealth to charitable causes some analysts note that blackstone executives received much less cash than the top hedge fund managers last year and compared with other private equity firms blackstone tries to cultivate a more modest image the offer memo refers to the fact that messrs schwarzman peterson and james reimburse the company for personal use of airplanes but other partners are expected to fly regular commercial flights compared with their counterparts at firms like tpg and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co a fact that gives rise to considerable complaints internally despite such gestures mr schwarzman and blackstone have become candidates for a potential backlash and regulatory action "going public entails another whole level of scrutiny " daniel daniello co founder of carlyle group another large private equity firm said at
