small talk kelly spors answers questions from readers about entrepreneurship q im working to launch my own line of luxury goods i have finished samples and gorgeous photography rather than manufacturing the goods first would it be a disaster for me to send out images and information to magazines in hopes of being featured and to get possible sales leads that way or would i be sinking myself before im in the marketplace since i wouldnt have ready inventory erica wilcott aiken s c a dont forget that luxury goods buyers expect to be treated like gold and that any glitches with customer orders or your supply chain can tarnish your reputation fast your idea of getting photographs published in high profile magazines before you have inventory is risky most consumers assume a product is readily available if its shown in a magazine and they want the merchandise quickly yet its possible for some luxury goods makers to market themselves in a way that makes their customers feel their products are worth waiting for says jeff winsper president of winsper a boston consulting firm on luxury goods branding for instance some luxury items like steinway pianos are custom made or limited in supply so customers feel theyre getting an exclusive item and will gladly wait several weeks for it to arrive but if you go this route youd better have your supply chain the manufacturer the materials and the shipping all ready to go so you can tell customers exactly how long theyll need to wait you dont want them to get upset because they expected it earlier whats more you should portray yourself as an established business so that customers dont feel like theyre taking a chance by ordering from you mr winsper adds richard baker chief executive of the luxury marketing council of dallas fort worth says its safer for small luxury goods makers to break into the market by finding a small boutique that sells similar items and persuading them to grant you shelf space by telling them the story behind your business and how you plan to market your goods then you manufacture a small amount of inventory before expanding into larger markets but there are alternatives for instance you could first try getting your photographs in specialized or local publications to make sure you can fill orders before sending them to well known magazines or try selling direct to consumers using a web site to sell your products makes it easier to control your inventory if youre feeling overwhelmed with business you can stop running online ads to slow orders down but going this route requires a good grasp of online and search marketing to help the right consumers find your products online
