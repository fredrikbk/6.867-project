a cultural conversation with micheal flaherty his movie company is far from hollywood in many ways boston the offices of walden media have the feel of a dot com startup in the s the staff members seem like college buddies and at least a few are the reception area features a beat up futon and there are cool toys everywhere but walden a movie production company whose offices are based here miles from hollywood is trying to create something more than a passing fad the company which is owned by billionaire media mogul philip anschutz creates faithful movie adaptations of classic childrens tales its biggest hit so far has been "the lion the witch and the wardrobe" but walden has also made a touching "bridge to terabithia" out june on dvd a charming "charlottes web" and a rollicking "around the world in days" and then there are some titles like "holes" the story of young stanley yelnats sentenced to dig holes in the texas desert as punishment for stealing a pair of sneakers who manages to uncover a tale of ancestral curses exotic fortunetellers wild west shoot outs and buried treasure that people over the age of and who dont have kids may never have heard of "how do you pick the stories " i ask micheal flaherty waldens president and co founder a round irish catholic guy with a heavy boston accent mr flaherty has a boyish face and a boyish enthusiasm for his project "we look for books where kids can really experience something life changing and transformational and can rise above their circumstances " he tells me but that makes waldens movies sound like schmaltzy after school specials which they most certainly are not mr flaherty says the ideas for which books to adapt come from teachers and librarians around the country he sends his staff to several conferences of each group every year but walden is careful to avoid stories that are "of the moment of concern to someone of that day " that is a popular genre though last summer for example the childrens book council a trade association of childrens publishers recommended "alls fair in love war and high school " the story of a cheerleaders campaign for student body president when i describe such books to mr flaherty he smiles knowingly "c s lewis described a kid named eustace clarence scrubs when he first gets to narnia he is completely overmatched because he has read all the wrong books he had read about grain elevators and fat kids doing exercises but he didnt read books about heroism and courage the timeless transcendental things and thats what we look for literature wise " mr flaherty acknowledges that he wasnt reading such things when he was a kid his tastes ran more to comic books but as a young adult he found himself working on massachusetts education reform during the week and tutoring disadvantaged kids in boston on saturday mornings when he would ask the children what they did the previous evening it was always the same thing watching tv or movies but when "titanic" came out in mr flaherty recalls they started telling him about going on trips to museums to see exhibits about the famous sinking they even took books out of the library on ship building "i saw a big idea there " he contacted his roommate from tufts university cary granat who was in hollywood producing movies like "scream" and "children of the corn " he told mr granat his idea for "creating movies to get kids into learning " mr granat who had a young daughter at the time had become interested in making different kinds of movies as well the two spent a year traveling the country looking for investors "i flunked micro and macro in college " mr flaherty jokes "so i bought business plans for dummies " by the end of that year messrs flaherty and granat had received a lot of good advice from the potential investors they met but no one would put any money on the table that is until they met philip anschutz though some of the movies have done exceedingly well mr anschutz is still adding untold millions to waldens budget each year in a speech in february mr anschutz told his audience "my friends think im a candidate for a lobotomy and my competitors think im naive or stupid or both but you know what i dont care if we can make some movies that have a positive effect on peoples lives and on our culture thats enough for me " and the walden movies do somehow seem different earnest without being treacly they all have children at their centers and most have animals too in an age of targeted marketing they seem to appeal across gender and age lines many of them have strong religious elements mr flaherty said that this is not necessarily part of their mission but librarians and teachers were very strongly recommending stories with spiritual themes and their messages to children are empowering ones mr flaherty notes that much of the family fare offered by hollywood presents childrens situations as "hopeless " he cites g k chesterton on the subject of fairy tales "we dont write about dragons just to write about dragons we write about dragons to show that they can be defeated " which is not to say that the worlds depicted in waldens stories are always comforting for children narnia has some pretty frightening battles and "the dark is rising " based on the s series by british writer susan cooper out this fall from walden does not shy away from the notion that there is real evil in the world i ask mr flaherty whether parents should be concerned about the level of violence in such films again he paraphrases c s lewis "people usually have two kinds of objections to kids witnessing this kind of violence one is to protect kids from those pathological fears that keep them up late at night and for that i have complete respect the other one is borne of a naive assumption that we should insulate our kids from knowing they are born into a world of good and evil and that one i reject the best thing we can do for kids is to teach them that though they may encounter cruel enemies they will also encounter brave knights if we dont teach kids that were making their future only darker not brighter " if the old saw is true that when it comes to censorship liberals want to regulate violence and conservatives want to regulate sex walden seems like an awfully conservative company the closest any of the children in the movies come to romance is when fern rides the ferris wheel at the county fair with henry in "charlottes web " mr flaherty tells me that while they do not explicitly avoid boy girl relationships in their movies none of the teachers or librarians are recommending books with that theme watching "bridge to terabithia " which is about a boy girl friendship the characters dont even kiss one wonders whether the adolescents involved are from another century people who market products to children today talk about a phenomenon called k g o y kids getting older younger a mattel executive recently told the new yorker "little girls are really much more sophisticated now than they used to be " mr flaherty is skeptical of this kind of attitude "i dont get and year olds being attracted to cynicism " he tells me "weve spoken to professors and child psychologists and theyve told us that this doesnt reflect reality for the most part kids love their brothers and sisters they have good relationships with their parents and good relationships with their teachers " speaking of teachers walden purchases hundreds of thousands of the books on which each movie is based to distribute to schools nationwide along with a bunch of educational materials i ask mr flaherty whether walden is sending the message that seeing the movie is the reward for completing the chore of reading the book and whether children shouldnt simply spend more time reading than at the movies "i guess the popular thing is to only let kids watch pbs and limit their screen time to minutes " mr flaherty says but he lets his three children watch plenty of age appropriate television and movies and even play video games in their spare time he cites an national endowment for the arts study that showed that kids who are the strongest readers are still watching two or three hours of television a day "people can get their crime and punishment and their law &amp order in the same day " he jokes ultimately though he tells me that walden is doing something that transcends any particular medium its just launched a joint venture with penguin to publish new books that might someday be made into films by walden or by another movie company and walden is even considering getting into the video game business mr flaherty is convinced that their project is "platform neutral" "our idea is to get kids back to loving stories " ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
