enterprise small firms see big potential in going green consumer concerns and a desire to buy locally boost sales when ofer mizrahi launched a line of eco friendly flooring products and countertops in the response was lukewarm "people were skeptical about the durability of the products and if they would last " says the year old entrepreneur what a difference a few years makes revenue at mr mizrahis miami based business coveringsetc soared to &# million last year from &# million in the company now has employees and four showrooms in three states the explanation part of it was simply better marketing mr mizrahi learned to pay more attention to selling the design and quality of his products but more important a fundamental change was taking place the public had started to see the value of eco friendly construction materials thanks in part to a widespread movement toward "green" architecture the eco terr line has become a hit "as more people become aware and learn more about green products and technology " mr mizrahi says for entrepreneurs its never been a better time to go green prompted by fears of global warming and other environmental ills consumers have started seeking out more eco friendly products giving a big boost to small businesses that serve the niche some entrepreneurs have also gotten a hand from government programs that reward them for helping the environment just how strong is consumer interest in green products heres one measure according to the organic trade association a small business trade group in greenfield mass sales of organic foods and beverages reached &# billion last year a increase from &# billion in meanwhile sales for nonfood organic products such as soaps and paper was &# million in no data are available for says the association many consumers of course are turning to large companies such as whole foods market inc for their eco friendly products not small businesses but ultimately some experts and entrepreneurs argue small businesses have an advantage over big ones when it comes to selling green merchandise many green consumers tend to see a small local business as naturally more environmentally sound than a sprawling multinational and small businesses can provide a personal touch that big ones cant which can be important when selling complicated eco friendly wares "small businesses connect with consumers on a personal level " says michelle barry senior vice president of hartman group a research institute in seattle small businesses making green products can also gain an edge in new product development by giving suppliers a home to test new formulations and components "we can work with the procter &amp gambles and it will take a year to change the mind sets about these long held formulations " says peter huntsman ceo of huntsman corp a &# billion chemical conglomerate based in the woodlands texas that makes additives that go in an array of products including clothes detergents furniture and automobiles "but we are seeing an explosion taking place with the smaller operations that make end use products for consumers " says mr huntsman mr huntsman who estimates his company has partnerships with small partners says he believes there will be applications for green items that will be specific to certain regions this he says will also open more doors for small firms for instance there might be more opportunities for a green laundry detergent out west where there are larger families than in midtown manhattan where more people send shirts out to be laundered "typically the revolution will start locally before someone starts tinkering with the tide laundry detergent " mr huntsman says some green entrepreneurs say being small gives them another advantage since they arent answerable to shareholders or big investors they can stay true to their vision and values thats why jeff mendelsohn founder of new leaf paper funded the small paper manufacturing business himself he also relies on the personal touch when selling his recycled wares the year old entrepreneur sells directly to printers and end users rather than relying on distributors "we have a unique product line and story to tell in the paper industry and we prefer to manage our customer relationship directly " mr mendelsohn says last year new leaf paper brought in revenue of &# million up from &# million in when the company launched its own paper line the government is also giving small businesses a spur to go green just as large companies receive government breaks for environmental friendliness the department of agriculture offers a small business innovation research program that offers awards of &# to &# for using certain environmentally friendly practices in selling or processing wares the environmental protection agency gives grants to small businesses involved in environmental industries and initiatives on a state level new york awards funds to small businesses that are involved in projects such as pollution prevention and recycling such grants helped brother and sister bill and deborah robbins owners of rubberform recycled products llc in lockport n y the company recycles old rubber such as tires and turns it into new products "rubber is a real problem " says ms robbins a year old former health care worker "we want to do our part by reducing the numbers of used tires dumped into landfills by cleaning up the environment for our children and future generations " the pair used local state and federal funds as well as private investments to launch the business in december through the end of may sales totaled &# and the company recently received a contract from another eco friendly small business rubbersidewalks inc of gardena calif to make its rubber sidewalk footpath products
