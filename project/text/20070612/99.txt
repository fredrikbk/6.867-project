the ghost house prague in mudawi ibrahim adam a professor of engineering at the university of khartoum was arrested by security agents and detained for seven months in what the sudanese called "the ghost house " in he was detained again for five months from to he was imprisoned for eight months and again for five months in the reason "the regime knew my views were against fundamentalism " mr mudawi speaks matter of factly about his experiences in the dungeons of islamist dictator omar bashir "you are taken in blindfolded " he says "you go into a cell sometimes its very dark theres nothing in it except the floor sometimes you are placed in a small crowded room sometimes in a large empty one it all depends on the situation they want to put you in they keep you up all night and cuff you to the door forcing you to stand beating is the normal thing " mr mudawi who heads the non governmental sudan social development organization or sudo is in prague to attend what is being billed in the press as a "dissidents conference " russias garry kasparov is here as is egyptian academic saad eddin ibrahim former syrian parliamentarian mamoun homsy and others from iran palestine belarus lebanon iraq saudi arabia and china they mix easily with a half dozen israelis led by natan sharansky the former soviet dissident who with the czech republics vaclav havel and spains jose maria aznar is chairing the event the idea is to put together what mr sharansky describes as "a trade union for dissidents " which can do to the various tyrannies of our day what polands solidarity movement did to the great tyranny of its time also making appearances are sen joe lieberman and george w bush who in his speech wednesday described himself as a "dissident president " mr mudawi does not begrudge him the label "i have a different view of bush " he says having twice met the president privately "people say hes crap i see him as a very intelligent person not that im in favor of his positions but hes focused and he knows what hes talking about its his advisers who are the problem " reportedly it took mr sharanskys personal intercession to get mr bush to come to prague against the advice of the state department a depressing indication of where things stand with what used to be called "the freedom agenda " thats bad news for mr mudawi whose personal jeopardy waxes and wanes depending in part on the amount of scrutiny the regime feels itself under from the u s sudo was founded in while mr bashir following a long dalliance with osama bin laden was seeking favor with the clinton administration by improving intelligence ties and relaxing domestic repression over time however the relationship grew too comfortable mr bashir relaxed and the repression returned in april the cia received sudanese intelligence chief salah abdullah in washington at the time mr mudawi was being prosecuted on espionage charges which carry the death penalty the case was suspended thanks to an international outcry but the charges stand "if you are saying you are for democracy well then ok " he says "this is the most brutal person in this government and you are rewarding him for helping you on terrorism but you are doing it at the expense of the people of sudan " at the conference the formal title of which is "democracy and security " there is a debate about whether a policy that promotes the former in places like iraq is inversely correlated with the latter mr mudawis experience in sudan suggests democracy and security are in fact mutually reinforcing he observes that mr bashirs dictatorship has from the first been sustained by islamic radicals such as al qaeda and the muslim brotherhood which used their influence with mr bashir to infiltrate the security services and the army and from there to sow chaos throughout the country hence the situation in darfur as with sudanese generally most darfuris practice a sufi version of islam that eschews extremism and is therefore hostile to mr bashirs government "from the beginning the islamic fundamentalists were having a problem with the people of darfur because they wouldnt support them " he says "some people say the problem is tribal thats wrong its the central government waging war against its own people " through sodu mr mudawi has been calling attention to the plight of darfur since two years before the killing began in earnest with each return to the region he has witnessed new lows in chaos pillage rape and murder not to mention new lows in the failure of the international community to do much about it the presence of african union troops he says has made no difference and the united nations is even worse "sudan said it didnt want u n special envoy jan pronk and the u n removed him at el fasher a town in north darfur a human rights monitor was doing good work protecting people so the government said we dont want him here and the u n caved in when i asked the u n why dont you protect your own staff they gave me irrelevant excuses " what would work mr mudawis answer is an international embargo on sudans oil exports the governments main source of income enforced by the credible threat of an international boycott of next years olympics in beijing if china the principal producer and customer of that oil persists in doing khartoums bidding at the u n security council his goal isnt to moderate the behavior of the regime but to replace it with a secular democratic federal state something he believes is doable "the fundamentalists dont have the support of even of the people " he says "the first free election would be the downfall of them " if that sounds like a pipe dream in prague it can almost be believed the conference takes place at the czernin palace where in czechoslovakias freedom died with the probable murder of foreign minister jan masaryk and where years later its freedom was reborn with the formal dissolution of the warsaw pact when it comes to ghost houses at least some have been exorcised of their demons
