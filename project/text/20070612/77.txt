politics &amp economics how russia seeks to shape europes security posture old pact is cited in bid for leverage against nato brussels a dispute over europes cornerstone security treaty shows how russian president vladimir putin remains determined to shape the continent on moscows terms despite cooling his recent cold war style rhetoric russia has summoned officials from the north atlantic treaty organization and ex warsaw pact nations to vienna for a special four day conference starting today to discuss the conventional forces in europe treaty which limits how many combat aircraft and heavy weapons are allowed in europe the dispute is as much about principles as it is about arms moscow is upset because no nato country has ratified changes to the treaty adopted in to reflect the fact that the warsaw pact no longer exists some warsaw pact members such as poland now belong to nato others such as the three baltic states have joined nato but arent covered by the treaty nato countries have balked at adopting the changes because the group wants moscow to first withdraw relatively small numbers of troops and obsolete munitions from its smaller ex soviet neighbors moldova and georgia both fear an escalation in their tense relations with moscow moscows resistance to natos demand speaks volumes about its attitude toward its neighbors and its frustration at western built alliances and international bodies in recent years russia has become increasingly vocal in its opposition to a perceived campaign by the u s and nato to contain it militarily by expanding into the former soviet union it has been angered too by the involvement of the european union in bilateral disputes with member states such as polands efforts to persuade russia to drop a ban on its meat exports moscow also has protested the use of bodies such as the organization for security and cooperation in europe to monitor elections and monitor so called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova with what moscow sees as an anti russian bias mr putin appeared more conciliatory at last weeks summit of the group of eight leading nations he offered the u s use of a russian radar base in azerbaijan provided washington doesnt build its own radar in the czech republic to support a planned missile defense system but in a speech at a russian business conference in st petersburg this weekend mr putin returned to anti western language when he attacked the world trade organization the international monetary fund and the world bank as outdated and in need of change he said they fail to "reflect the new balance of power" in the world russia is the only major global economy that isnt yet a wto member "russia is just fed up with recent developments when none of our concerns were taken up " said konstantin kosachev chairman of the international affairs committee of the state duma the lower house of russias parliament "if you want russia as a partner you need at least to talk to russia if not we have to take steps to show this is serious for russia " one such step was russias decision to call this weeks conference on the european conventional forces treaty russia has said it wont repeat earlier threats to pull out of the treaty but last month first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov declared a moratorium on verification inspections and information sharing under the treaty "if we want to be formal about it and start counting the nato side is in gross violation" of caps on heavy military equipment under the treaty said vladimir chizhov russias permanent representative to the eu he said poland and other new nato members should now count their armed forces against natos quota russian officials are angry too about u s plans to rotate some of its nato troops from bases in germany to romania and bulgaria countries on the black sea and closer to potential flash points in moldova and georgia these two countries have " main battle tanks armored personnel carriers pieces of heavy artillery above their ceiling and thats today after the americans move in there will be even more " said mr chizhov giving a taste of what nato officials can expect in vienna nato doesnt dispute the adapted cfe treaty is necessary but says russia must first fulfill commitments to georgia and moldova that it made in a statement attached to the treaty changes alliance officials and ambassadors say a principle is at stake you cant station troops in other countries against their will since russia has pulled most of its troops and weapons from georgia and moldova but georgia wants russian peacekeepers removed from a base in its russian backed separatist territory of abkhazia moldova wants about remaining russian troops and peacekeepers and tons of munitions pulled out of its russian backed separatist territory transdnistria the peacekeepers could be replaced with international monitors including russians under u s and eu proposals "this is not that hard" to resolve said paula desutter the u s assistant secretary of state for arms treaty verification compliance and implementation but russian diplomats say the commitments it made in werent a legal requirement for fulfilling the treaty mr chizhov also argues peacekeepers werent covered by the commitments and the dispute has nothing to do with nato since moldova and georgia arent alliance members moldova and georgia worry that russia is balking because it wants to stay in their territories for the long term relations between georgia and russia have deteriorated sharply during the past two years and moscow has imposed sweeping trade and transport embargoes on its neighbor georgia believes russia is backing two separatist territories in order to thwart georgias nato membership
