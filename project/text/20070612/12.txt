business technology talking tech good site bad site evolving web design design on the internet is a moving target says forrester research which has looked at more than sites over the last few years in a recent report the research outfit says that web site design for businesses trying to attract consumers still has a long way to go forrester analyst bruce temkin reports on what is getting better with the layout of web sites and what hasnt changed q what is the biggest problem that web sites have these days a in the early days the biggest problems sites had was with value they just werent delivering value now thats improved but over the last few years the bigger problem has become navigation as sites get bigger and more complex they have much more value but its harder to have people get to what they want say you are an insurance company that wants to provide information to users looking for coverage in the same place where users are asked what kind of coverage they want there should be information about what the right coverage ought to be but often youll find the information isnt available on that page you might be able to find it somewhere else if you look through several layers but its not available where its most appropriate q what other problems are there a one of the biggest problems that sites have is having their home pages provide evidence that user tasks can be completed a basic usability principle is that if you want someone to continue with a process such as buying something two fundamental things should happen users should feel there is a high likelihood they can accomplish the task and they should be given clear evidence that they are making progress along the way a lot of sites dont design their home pages for that to occur q for example a say its a retail site and we are a user who has a problem with a product and wants to return it what we would look for on the home page is a specific link that a user could click on for returning products but some sites might bury that link behind a tab that might say "service and support " the key goals for your customers should be obvious from the home page q how do well designed sites happen a the really good sites are designed by groups that ask and answer three questions who are your target users what are their goals and how are you going to help them achieve those goals q how about bad sites a some companies have a very internal or self centered view of design lacking a focus on customers theyll be trying to make design decisions in a committee and a vp of marketing will come into the room and say i like that one or that one works for me when i am sitting in on these meetings i always say i dont care what any of you like this isnt about satisfying your needs its about satisfying your customers needs q cant web sites improve their design by asking for feedback from users a the difference between a good site and a bad site isnt how effectively they listen to user feedback but what sort of design mechanisms they have in place to begin with you need good design skills to even interpret feedback from customers customers cant tell you how to fix a problem they can only tell you that the problem exists
