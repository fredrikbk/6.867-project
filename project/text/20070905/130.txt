watch out for the china bashers the recent outcry over poisonous pet food and the recall of lead tainted toys sourced by mattel in china proves one thing we have a china problem it is not however a china problem in the way most people think it is not a problem with safety standards that threaten our children and our pets it is a problem with the very fact of china as an emerging force on the global economic stage and it underscores a profound and worrying trend in american political and economic life for half a century we fought for the creation of a global capitalist system now that we have one we seem to have forgotten one little thing capitalism means competition and we are acting like we cant handle it to understand that the uproar over the toys isnt really about product safety we need to look back at the past few years and see that the current hullabaloo is just the latest incarnation of our simmering china problem the rumblings began during the election of with accusations that u s companies that outsourced work to china were traitorous and being led by "benedict arnold ceos " never mind that most of the jobs outsourced to china had already been outsourced to mexico a decade ago the chorus grew two years ago when one of chinas state owned energy companies attempted to buy unocal that led to a strenuous and yes bipartisan position in congress that allowing the deal to go forward would jeopardize national security and unfairly benefit china democratic sen ron wyden declared "i dont think being a free trader is synonymous with being a sucker and patsy " the republicans were no better the deal was scuttled then last year the sharply rising trade deficit and current account deficit with china generated pressure in congress to force china to allow its currency the yuan to appreciate more rapidly against the u s dollar the first proposal was sponsored by sens lindsey graham and charles schumer and would slap china with a tariff unless it allows for an immediate and sharp revaluation the second is working through the senate this summer and is sponsored by sens charles grassley and max baucus it would force the treasury department to label china a currency manipulator based on the fact that china doesnt allow the yuan to float freely that in turn would lead to series of procedural moves with escalating penalties never mind the fact that even a substantial rise in the currency wouldnt change the dynamics of u s china trade china is appealing not just because of costs but because of a reliable infrastructure and a proven ability to produce never mind that sourcing in china has direct benefits for hundreds of millions of americans in the form of less expensive goods from appliances to entertainment never mind that china partly subsidizes u s spending and consumption by purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of u s treasuries and never mind that china has become an integral market for u s goods and companies as the purchasing power of chinese consumers rises rapidly macau is already a larger market for u s gaming companies than las vegas and multinationals such as proctor &amp gamble and ge are seeing some of their fastest most substantial growth from selling to china not from sourcing in china while the rhetoric in congress and on the campaign trail isnt likely to derail these trends the unwillingness to acknowledge the benefits of chinas rise is part of a pattern of china bashing that raises questions about the ability of the u s to compete in the global economy that it did so much to create the issue of safety needs to be seen in this context there is no question that standards in china are less rigorous than they should be but consumer concerns over product safety long predate the current scare and only a severe case of amnesia can turn this into a china issue remember ralph nader in his s heyday how about the global recall of perrier water made in france in because of fears of benzene contamination or the rollover problem of the ford explorer in the same period what about the recall of halogen torchier lamps in because of an unfortunate tendency for the bulbs to explode read the annual report of the u s consumer product safety commission in which pointed to the recall of infant "bean bag" cushions made in the u s that caused deaths moreover given the recent outcry over dangerous tires made in china we should remember that this pales in comparison to the deaths attributed to defective firestone tires in the late s that led to the recall of million in this is only a small sample of product recalls in the past years that had nothing to do with china while this year china is a major source of product defects the actual number of faulty products is regrettably normal proportionate to how much it produces and comparable to the safety issues that have bedeviled manufacturers of all nationalities in past decades companies not countries bear ultimate responsibility for what they sell under the label and it says something about current attitudes that so many have collectively forgotten the recent history of product safety concerns and turned it into a china problem chinese officials recognize that reason and rationality arent at work here zhao baoqing a chinese trade official in washington recently attacked the quality of u s goods sold in china and pointed to cranes and to generators made by general electric as posing serious safety hazards most americans will in this climate probably dismiss his claims as so much empty rhetoric but the record of safety issues with u s made products should give anyone pause before doing so as we plunge into this long election season china is a convenient bogeyman for all sorts of ills and fears without question china presents an unparalleled challenge at various points in the th century the u s faced military and ideological threats but since the dawn of the american republic we have never faced the kind of economic challenge that china presents it is playing the game of global capitalism almost as adeptly as we are and our response for now seems to be a mixture of fear and disbelief rather than seeing china as adding to an expanding global economic pie we treat its ascendance as a zero sum proposition for our workers our companies our currency and now even our health while the evolution of china and the u s is anything but certain and while each face internal issues that could derail the steady move forward one thing should be fairly clear our china problem is going to harm us more than it will derail china it is perfectly legitimate for us to demand that chinese companies and authorities attend to product safety and to a level playing field in terms of trade that after all is the guiding spirit of the world trade organization it is perfectly legitimate as both hillary clinton and barack obama have said to treat china as a competitor and press the chinese for greater access more transparency and assorted reforms but much of the rhetoric and cultural undercurrent these days casts china as the on deck enemy should al qaeda not prove up to the task of long term adversary like it or not china is going to be a force to contend with just as the u s was a century ago already we are more linked to china than most of us realize or than many would like if china bashing becomes the prism through which china is viewed the recent turmoil in the markets caused by the subprime mortgage mess will seem placid by comparison mr karabell is executive vice president and chief
