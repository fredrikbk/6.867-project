income investors rediscover bonds market rout of recent weeks has boosted yields to levels that are irresistible to some locking in at a flood of selling by hedge funds and institutional investors has depressed the prices of a wide variety of bonds in recent weeks now individual investors are being lured by the attractive yields on many of these income generating investments as prices have declined on many bonds ranging from investment grade corporate issues to high yield or junk rated municipal bonds their yields have gone up some bonds with good credit quality are offering yields as much as half a percentage point above where they were just a few weeks ago while yields on junk rated issues are up as much as two or three percentage points thats created a buying opportunity for some people mutual funds that invest in high yield corporate bonds saw net inflows of investors cash last week for the first time in nearly three months according to amg data services which tracks fund flows meanwhile funds that hold investment grade corporate bonds bank loans and high yield municipal bonds saw sharp reductions in the amount of money being pulled out with a greater number of these funds reporting inflows and fewer reporting outflows "what we appear to be seeing is that investors are discovering new opportunities at these lower price levels " says robert adler president of amg whose latest data are for the week ended aug "overall investor sentiment is stabilizing in the fixed income area " there are risks of course to stepping back into the bond market when prospects for the economy remain uncertain this summers credit market crunch brought on by worries about defaults on subprime mortgages prompted widespread selling of bonds and bond funds with exposure to asset backed loans instead investors fled to the safety of treasurys if that continues nongovernment bond prices could fall further and its often tougher for individual investors to know if theyre getting a fair price on bonds since the pricing mechanism isnt as open as in other markets still there are signs that investors are regaining their confidence in fixed income investments leon rousso a financial planner in ventura calif has been buying bonds issued by gmac the finance arm of general motors corp for one client mr rousso says he bought bonds maturing in at a discount which allowed him to lock in an annualized yield to maturity of daphne elliott another of mr roussos clients says she isnt worried about the credit quality of the gmac bonds which carry the highest grade available for junk bonds "it was general motors after all not some skittish equity " says the year old retiree dan genter of rnc genter capital management a money manager in los angeles says the best bargains have been in corporate paper because "thats where the real dislocation has been " mr genter has been buying for clients investment grade corporate bonds that are nearly half a percentage point higher than just a few weeks ago for instance he says he recently purchased bonds issued by bear stearns cos with a coupon of and due in the bonds are now yielding he says in the week ended aug investors pumped &# million net into funds holding high yield corporate bonds after withdrawing money on a net basis for straight weeks according to amg investors also began piling out of bank loan funds in mid july a trend that peaked when net outflows reached &# million in the week ended aug amg says but in the latest week net outflows from bank loan funds which hold senior secured bonds backed by bank assets eased to &# million matthew tuttle a financial planner in stamford conn has been adding to clients positions in bank loan funds in recent weeks "i think the funds were unfairly penalized throughout the subprime crises " says mr tuttle who uses the highland floating rate fund and the highland floating rate advantage fund unlike other high yield funds mr tuttle says the bonds in bank loan funds are more protected in times of crises fewer investors are also pulling out of high yield municipal bond funds last weeks outflows of nearly &# million from the funds were the lowest since investors began net withdrawals from the funds in early july amg says carolyn dolan founding principal at samson capital advisors in new york has found bargains in investment grade municipal bonds including the new york state thruway personal income tax revenue bonds due with a yield to maturity of she says yields on munis in the six to year range have jumped about to in the past couple of weeks investors also are showing greater confidence in equity investments although outflows from stock funds began later than from bond funds stock mutual funds and exchange traded funds saw net inflows in the latest week after four consecutive weeks of outflows according to amg amgs weekly fund flow numbers capture of the funds reporting data but represent roughly of the assets thats because the data exclude major fund families such as fidelity investments and vanguard group amgs monthly numbers include the bigger fund companies and are expected to provide further evidence that money is coming back to bonds and stock funds though bond yields are up they are down from their peaks as investors have come back into the market the benchmark triple a rated year municipal bond hit a recent yield high of last month but has since dropped back to as of aug according to research firm thomson financial but that is up from at the start of the year average yields on investment grade corporate bonds have jumped about a half a percentage point in recent weeks to about or more for year issues yields have widened even further on junk rated issues whose prices began falling earlier this year for example yields on bonds issued by specialty finance companies such as cit group inc and by the finance arms of the auto makers such as ford motor co and gm have jumped by two to three percentage points to more than in the past three months says mr genter the money manager some advisers are finding bargains in other product areas closed end mutual funds for example are trading at wider than usual discounts to their net asset values unlike regular mutual funds closed end funds issue only a set number of shares so depending on investor demand they can trade at prices above or below their nav starting this week mr tuttle the stamford planner began buying the eaton vance floating rate fund a closed end bank loan fund for some of his clients the fund is currently trading at a discount to its nav he says and is paying a yield of closed end funds however tend to have wider swings in prices since the funds often borrow money to enhance returns so if interest rates were to rise the nav could drop sharply because the leverage will exacerbate the drop in prices ian weinberg chief executive of family wealth &amp pension llc a financial planning firm in woodbury n y has been buying preferred stocks issued by money center banks and brokerage firms such as citigroup inc merrill lynch &amp co inc goldman sachs group inc and bank of america corp yields on preferred stocks which carry a fixed dividend and whose prices move with interest rates were yielding about a few months ago peaked at about last month and are now around he says one of the risks with preferred shares however is that many issues can be called away meaning the issuing company can buy back the shares at par value after reaching the "call date " while the shares could be called away if interest rates drop investors could find issues that allow them to lock in or more yields for two to four years says mr weinberg yields on so called callable bonds have also jumped in recent weeks because of the market volatility when a bond is callable it means that the issuer has the right to pay off that debt early often this happens when interest rates are dropping which means that investors get their money back at a bad time for reinvesting it samson capitals ms dolan last week bought some new york city general obligation bonds maturing in with a call date of on a tax equivalent basis and adjusting for new york city and new york state taxes the yield to call date is and yield to maturity date is for a person in the tax bracket she says bond bargains investors are wading back into bonds but risks remain many investment grade corporate bonds are yielding about half a percentage point more than a few weeks ago yields on some corporate junk bonds have jumped two to three percentage points many closed end funds are trading at unusually wide discounts to net asset value with the economic outlook uncertain there are risks to buying nongovernment bonds
