mattresses with serta and five perfumes bear the vera wang signature all told her privately held empire generated at least &# million in wholesale sales last year now ms wang years old has designed a line of dresses starting at &# and handbags starting at &# for discount chain kohls corp bearing the name simply vera vera wang as the cheap chic apparel accessories and home goods arrive sunday at more than kohls stores naysayers are watching for signs that the line will weaken ms wangs image her high end collection is only three years old and many consumers still know her best for her bridal gowns the chinese american designer raised on manhattans tony upper east side recently took a break from preparing for her runway show at new yorks fashion week which starts today to discuss the new line ms wang dressed in black leggings and an oversize top at her park avenue home reflected on the challenges of building a powerful brand excerpts wsj whats on your mind as you launch this kohls line ms wang well i am nervous i would be dishonest if i said i wasnt but i think i brought intelligent fashion and style and a sense of who i am personally to the merchandise i took my best shot at it and of course it is nerve racking i have never gone this path so it is a big job for me i dont consider it a jump down i consider it a jump across to a much bigger world being able to dress so many more women to me as a designer is a privilege sure i love the new collection runway show there is nothing like it but if i cant see my work on more people what did that mean ultimately for me as a designer fashion is also about being able to reach more women isnt that the ultimate goal are you dressing people in the world or are you dressing the world i would argue that both are possible you work so hard on it and then you put it out there and you dont know all you could do is your best guess thats about all any creative person can do a lot of the rest of course is marketing and a lot of it is how you present yourself your own tastes your own vision with the kohls project it is up to the consumer to decide so i am waiting to be judged in terms of how women approach it wsj what are the most important things a designer ought to do to build a powerful brand that can exist high and low ms wang there has to be segmentation in the product not only in terms of price specifically my runway collection is fashion forward and takes huge chances it is for very few it is there to create brand identity and brand awareness i like to think of it as extremely sophisticated lavender label is about a younger fit the sizing is tighter smaller a bit sexier lavender is about a client that has a more youthful kind of body type and attitude the kohls line is about being comfortable edgy whether you are wearing a &# dress or a &# top it could be for my teenage daughter a young working professional woman or a young mother even a middle age mother its not about age kohls is about ease and a comfort and you can throw it on it can be put together you can make it part of your own wardrobe but at every price point you have to ask how to really make it worth the money when a top is &# the question is does it look different enough is there enough technique are there enough decorative elements that make a woman feel this is worth &# for the kohls client who might be weighing whether to spend &# versus &# for a top the question is is there enough to justify the price in the detailing of the cuff or the texture and the fineness of the wool does it feel worth it thats the challenge you face at every level wsj what were the biggest chances you took in your career ms wang the first big chance i took was to open a retail store to sell wedding gowns everybody says retail is a big killer and that nobody succeeds in retail you go into retail to brand the company to have a presence the second biggest chance i took was going into ready to wear because ready to wear at the collection level is so costly the help needed the accessories the shoes on the runway the fabrics you have to invest in the know how to make the same pattern in sizes to to and lets not even talk about the production of the show itself the real figure minimum if you want to be really great is &# million think of what you have to make pretax just to break even so it is a loss leader but what it does do is aid the perception of the brand at the high end wsj do you think middle america is getting more or less sophisticated about fashion ms wang i have been all over the united states in my fashion career and one thing i noticed was how terrific women look today i see the way girls are put together and how their moms are put together and i am really pretty amazed they know what the flip flop is the t shirts they have the shorts they have a special jean they have a great designer handbag you should never underestimate women and dont underestimate how important fashion is in america today how important trends are how much women care when i was growing up in new york in the s fashion was very elitist you would go to alexanders or orbachs to buy the knockoff of french fashion wsj what sort of woman do you have in mind when you are designing your high end collection and your kohls collection ms wang it is always the same woman it is a woman who is quite confident and independent and also loves a bit of art some unique detail an element of surprise even if it is a twist of a sleeve one of the women i have always admired a lot is scottish model stella tenant she puts vintage together with new she puts boyish with dress up she makes fashion her own i dont care if you bought the most expensive coat or whether you bought the least expensive t shirt it is about an attitude it is about a woman who is active she loves her life even if she is wearing something quite precious she doesnt wear it in a precious way wsj which items in your new kohls line are your favorites ms wang there is a t shirt dress that i like in black jersey in the front there is this panel i could have done it in colors you put the little belt on it or not depending on whether it is a fat day or a skinny day it has an urban look the other piece is my short sleeve coat it has enough architecture to make it special i love the fact that you can dress it up or down you can be my daughters ages and in it or me in it one night the three of us walked out all wearing it going out to dinner my youngest wore it over a pair of jeans my older wore it over a dress i wore it over my ubiquitous leggings with a great top that said it all to me wsj like many other high end designers you have used licensing deals to extend your name into new realms what is your philosophy on licensing ms wang my products are things i relate to that is part of building a brand an area that we could go into that would make a lot of sense and not cost a lot of money is chocolate chocolate for weddings for gifts all of that it fits right into the weddings it is not like if i went into the car business wsj youve also said you are trying to model your business after ralph laurens what did you learn in your time at ralph lauren ms wang what i learned was that to really be in the fashion business you need a large infrastructure thats one thing a lot of young designers dont realize that leap between starting up and becoming a huge brand is a lot more costly than it used to be and there is a lot more competition so it is a lot harder to distinguish yourself today than most people think also ralph never sacrifices his upper end you also have to be true to your own vision of who you are as a designer wsj in bridal specifically players such as j crew now sell wedding gowns made of the same satin that you frequently use but at less than half the price have you tweaked your strategy in response to the new competition ms wang my bridal business is a luxury business and will always stay a luxury business it is what bridal means to me what we stand for and it is the foundation of our business wsj you have two kids a husband two dogs and a vast private business that is growing and you have plans to open your first nonbridal apparel boutique in new york this fall how do you make it all work ms wang i dont really make it all work i just do the best i can i also try to stress to my husband and children that i am a stand up person and i care about people and being the mother of daughters i have always been very much of a feminist i have always felt that if you can give back as a woman to other women thats one of the greatest things that you can do
