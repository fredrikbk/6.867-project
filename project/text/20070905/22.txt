business world is the housing panic overdone before addressing wall streets lobbying for rate cuts and housing bailouts lets turn to new orleans for another failure of government nerve providing money but not sensible steps to reduce vulnerability one of the least reported and most consequential political statements of recent years was new orleans mayor ray nagins "i have confidence that our citizens can decide intelligently for themselves where they want to rebuild once presented with the facts " that was march mr nagin was running for re election and his solomonic "rebuild at your own risk" was meant to shield him from charges that he was giving up on low lying parts of the city occupied at least in legend by the poor working class and black tens of billions in federal aid later an associated press round up last week cited tulane geographer richard campanella to the effect that "time weather patterns and the insurance market will prove the folly of allowing people to reoccupy the citys old footprint " whats true of new orleans is true of the entire gulf coast increasingly a government subsidized set of bowling pins in the path of inevitable hurricanes but this years katrina is the housing market in what seems to be an annual "crisis" that requires heroic federal exertions to relieve americans of the consequences of their own choices now let it be said that some serious and impressive people harvards martin feldstein john makin of the american enterprise institute various wall street forecasters see deep economic repercussions from a complex credit crunch arising from the subprime lending mess fed chairman ben bernanke appears to have become a believer after problems in the market for short term corporate debt yet its also the case that the feds first mission is protecting its political independence the bush administration has already started compromising with the political furies calling for tax changes and federal subsidies to help troubled borrowers this may turn out to be a downpayment on a rescue operation unjustified by the current "crisis " true theres always danger of self fulfilling prophecy but its interesting to note the endless use of words like "toxic " "worthless " etc for lower rated mortgage paper that however untradeable at the moment continues to perform though defaults and foreclosures will happen the hair pulling in some accounts overlooks the fact that these are collateralized obligations investors may lose some money but they wont lose all a related paranoia is that somehow the business of clearing wont occur because homeowners cant find the lenders with whom to work out if that were true the lenders wouldnt be able to find the homeowners on whom to foreclose not only will investors have every incentive to minimize their losses but workouts are often their best alternative the loss of a home a person cant afford through foreclosure can be anything from a tragedy to an inconvenience to a blessing though the press can be relied upon to focus on the widowed grandmother not the housing speculators who account for or more of foreclosures in hardest hit states and what about the half a million people who lost their homes in say without washington lifting a finger as katrina and showed it pays to be in the wrong place at the wrong time at the right time that is when cable tv will plump hours a day for government action on your behalf officialdom may believe its periodic bouts of activism have kept the ungovernable global markets from blowing up the real economy but those markets arguably have performed better than government katrina was the most anticipated disaster in history but neither the federal nor local government ever had any stomach for letting realistic price signals instruct homeowners and developers about the wisdom of living and building in locales that could not be protected from devastating weather youll know washington is doing for housing what it did for new orleans if it now heeds countless pleas to expand the mandate of fannie mae and freddie mac to refloat the housing market and refinance underwater loans their lending already has grown much faster than the economy much faster than housing demand channeling a current &# trillion in artificially cheapened capital into the housing market fannies and freddies securities were the direct conveyor recycling chinese surpluses into u s housing with washington supplying a de facto guarantee against chinese losses to imagine this wasnt a cause of home price inflation and in turn subprime lending is not to listen closely enough angelo mozilo ceo of troubled mortgage originator countrywide financial knows his customers "the main driver was real estate values rising and when they begin to rise no different from the tech boom everybody at all levels of society wants to participate they dont want to be left behind " for a longer term perspective on the same phenomenon consider that todays uptick in the foreclosure rate is nothing compared to the nine fold increase that began in the s and accelerated in the prosperous s and s other factors played a role but always available government backed financing has clearly helped make homeowners more willing to gamble their homes as a tax favored wealth accumulation strategy sadly a few economists who see todays troubles as reason to curb fannie and freddie wont get much hearing in washington our basic path to prosperity survived every other media denominated "crisis" of recent years and will likely survive the u s housing correction and the stock market is a powerful non panicky indicator here whether our prosperity can continue to survive the governments palliatives for all these upsets is another question
