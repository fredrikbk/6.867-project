policy "exists to be complied with down to the centimeter " said the mayor promising to demolish the building mr maroni an amateur boxer with a shaved head who stands feet inches tall claimed he was being scapegoated "im immoral dissolute and depraved if you like but i pay my taxes and my situation is legal " the year old mr maroni told brazilian reporters he denied that his building poses any

runway the runway is feet long but the actual space available for landing is just feet the tall buildings surrounding the landing strip prevent planes from touching down at its very end the hotel is

overrun area klaus schweem a pilot who is coordinator of sao paulos wings aviation school says that "if someone loses an engine while taking off that hotel becomes a big problem " the director of flight safety for the national aviators union capt carlos camacho says that ideally there would be fewer buildings around the airport but he doesnt see the hotel as a particular threat william voss president of the flight safety foundation in alexandria va says the landing area in congonhas is "on the short side but not alarming " whats most disturbing mr voss says is the way air safety has

nevertheless a few years ago he tried building a subterranean passageway between the two buildings city officials made him halt the project because of zoning concerns part of mr maronis problems at the bahamas club stem from a recent tv interview in which he seemed to brag about his business "yes its high class prostitution " mr maroni said "were not going to be hypocrites " mr maronis son arua says his fathers words were distorted by bad editing the newspaper o estado de sao paulo editorialized that it was high time authorities moved against "figures involved in marginal activities who remain far away or above the law " but mr maroni has plenty of fans too fabio alves passing by the shuttered club on a motorcycle paused long enough to predict that mr maroni would soon be free and running his hotel "powerful people go to his club and that gives him power " he said as an airliner roared overhead "he knows things that could embarrass people "
