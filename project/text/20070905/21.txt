business bookshelf the man who sharpened gillette doing what matters by james m kilts with john f manfredi and robert l lorber crown business pages &# when the hard nosed harold geneen was driving the growth of itt in its heyday in the s and s from a &# million company to a &# billion conglomerate his management philosophy was blunt "in business words are words explanations are explanations promises are promises but only performance is reality " when jim kilts showed up at gillette in the first outsider to run the boston based company in more than years he found a business with great brands losing market share its acquisitions of duracell and braun were not delivering sales and earnings were flat the company had missed its earnings estimates for straight quarters the stock had plummeted and wall street had lost patience yet two thirds of the top managers were getting top ratings people were being rewarded for effort performance under mr kiltss regime became the new measure as he recounts in "doing what matters " mr kilts was fortunate to have a wise board that included warren buffett and henry kravis mr kilts says that in mr buffetts view unrealistic earnings estimates were the problem mr buffett made his opinion known "both at gillette board meetings and in public comments " mr kilts writes quoting him saying "for a major corporation to predict that its per share earnings will grow over the long term at say percent annually is to court trouble " and "managers that always promise to make the numbers will at some point be tempted to make up the numbers " the book cites a fascinating mckinsey study showing that only of companies in a sample of more than were able to sustain double digit earnings growth for five consecutive years make that consecutive years and the number drops to less than overambitious projections lead to the death spiral that mr kilts calls the "circle of doom" sales shortfalls increased prices cuts in marketing "loading the trade" with excessive shipments to make sales forecasts and doom in considering a business memoir the place to start is with the credibility of the author it has been entertaining in recent years to read management advice based on unexpected sources like sun tzus "art of war" or genghis khan but any correlation between theory and business results is likely to be coincidence were on surer ground with "doing what matters " jim kilts has a stellar track record ably leading kraft and nabisco before really hitting his stride at gillette where he engineered a major turnaround his account written with john f manfredi and robert l lorber of facing down gillettes problems is particularly instructive plenty of options greeted him when he took over should gillette divest itself of duracell and cut further losses or hold duracell but treat batteries as a commodity and slash prices divest itself of braun divest itself of the personal care business should he strip the company of everything but the profitable razor and blade business introduce a fresh growth strategy by taking gillette into new product sectors or just throw in the towel and call in the bankers for the best possible endgame mr kilts took none of these steps how he and his team and he gives generous credit to his team and mentors went about setting a new and successful course is the heart of "doing what matters " as at kraft and nabisco mr kilts introduced a policy called zero overhead growth zog which aimed to control costs and then invest the savings in research product development and marketing his willingness to make cost cutting a way of life at his companies brings to mind the mantra of the semiconductor business the price of survival is to take out of costs every year forever but controlling costs was just one of several immediate fixes to stop the bleeding at gillette mr kilts also wanted to alter the companys prospects for long term health that would require something he calls functional excellence fe it is he writes "a broad gauge initiative to achieve best in class capability and performance at the best possible cost " early on in his tenure mr kilts says he was sure that plenty of his senior managers "would have said that fe was a euphemistic way of describing layoffs and cost reductions " but that is a simplistic view of the benefits of establishing a culture that rigorously searches for excess and waste one of the primary benefits of fe mr kilts writes is that it instills a company wide sense of "purpose and urgency " after about two years when he felt that his managers had got the hang of fe mr kilts decided to add a new wrinkle he called it total innovation ti a three tiered program of continuous improvement incremental innovation and "big bang" innovation meant to come up with "game changing" products such as in gillettes case the sensor and mach shaving systems the multipronged attack on gillettes problems worked the companys sales rose after his first year on the job then rose the second year and continued to thrive along with gillettes stock price which climbed between and but after considering the implications of heavy reliance on one profitable category surrounded by consolidating competition the company initiated and completed a merger with procter &amp gamble which had long coveted gillette as a complement to its own consumer products business the all stock deal in was valued at &# billion "doing what matters" is informative about how mr kilts brought all this about but the prose alas is at times clunky and couched in executive speak "pushback " "strat plan " "walk the walk " "metrics" the ultimate test of a business book however is whether it can be recommended with conviction to a young person starting out or on the way up on this score
