the daily fix for a third straight major henin ousts serena williams online edition one williams sister down one remaining at the u s open for the third straight time in a grand slam tournament justine henin dispatched serena williams in the quarterfinals last night ms williams has won just one set in their three encounters and forced just one tiebreak in the six sets shes dropped venus williams plays jelena jankovic tonight for a chance at a semifinal meeting with ms henin tennis fans who came to arthur ashe stadium last night hoping to see a williams triumph instead saw the worlds no player at peak form "it was a sedate crowd for the most part looking for some of that nocturnal u s open mayhem but instead getting a virtuoso performance from the tours most elegant player " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "we speak not of earrings or &# outfits but the elegance of the one handed backhand and a punishing forehand that often finds henin fully airborne at impact no one beyond henins minuscule inner circle seems to know her at all but henin speaks quite eloquently with a racket in her hands " in the boston globe bud collins writes eloquently about the " ms henins unlikely excellence "if this was your first glance at the global rivalry you would have cried stop the fight before it began " mr collins writes "it looked like a mismatch robust serena against scrawny justine youd have to be sherlock holmes to find any muscles on justine but somehow through coordination and willpower she blasts away with lethal line drive groundies her presence recalls another great mite named ken rosewall who was called muscles by his aussie brethren but that sort of guy sarcasm wouldnt fit her henins forehand now measures up to her celebrated one handed backhand and her serve is becoming more formidable in movement and retrieving shes a sprite who gets it right " mr collins may have written that column while wearing pants made nearly four decades ago from an italian political banner on his miami herald blog dave barry has more on mr collinss wacky wardrobe after the match ms williams glumly showed up for her mandatory press conference intimating that she was there only so she wouldnt have to pay a fine for skipping the inquisition of her opponent ms williams said "i just think she made a lot of lucky shots " "the words came snipping out from under the bill of a lowered baseball cap " bill dwyre writes in the los angeles times "eye contact was nonexistent add angry body language to angry words and you get an angry message one much angrier than the situation dictated she is years old has played nearly tour matches and done news conferences after each one its part of the deal its how the sport promotes itself she has been no won eight major tournaments been the toast of the town and a nation of tennis fans who have loved her and embraced her from the start despite her general self centered attitude and dismissive nature toward opponents " crucial chicago cubs numbers through mondays game the teams record was barely good enough for first place in the wretched nl central the record and era respectively of putative staff ace carlos zambrano in his prior six starts the number of consecutive seasons without a championship those numbers might add up to a plausible case for booing mr zambrano after his latest implosion contributed to an loss to the dodgers on monday but not in his view he said after the game "i dont understand why the fans were booing at me i cant understand that i thought these were the greatest fans in baseball they showed me today they just care about them thats no fair " sure its fair says chicago tribune columnist rick morrissey thats the fans right for caring more than players do and suffering more too "unless youre a player who grew up in chicago and rooted for the cubs in the face of overwhelming evidence that you were a goof for doing so you cant possibly know the feeling of dryness on the north side " mr morrissey writes "lets face it a multimillion dollar contract takes away a lot of the sting of not winning whatever your emotional investment is in the cubs it cant be bigger than your paycheck cubs fans have no such soft landing place no escape they cant go anywhere else oh they can move out of town but their cubs afflictions are hitched to their cars right now the fans see a mediocre division and a golden opportunity to get to the playoffs they look in their rearview mirrors and see those seasons of aridity they see the end of their communal rope they want to win now the fans know you players are trying but theyre sick of rooting for effort theyve seen decades of both effort and lack of effort theyre sick of tapping their toes checking their watches and waiting for next year they want results now " inevitably mr zambrano apologized for his comments "there was no mention of crawling on his knees through bucktown in penance or wearing a hairshirt until christmas " rick telander writes in the chicago sun times "but his mea culpa droned on like something you might expect to hear from a convicted murderer or michael vick and what it showed is how weird and tense cub dom has become now that the signature player in the teams frantic lame duck push for a world series has seemingly melted down again into a big pile of money and immaturity " as football seasons begin on both sides of the atlantic sportswriters check in with the players rudely discarded by clubs and seeking a place to play or an alternative career si coms peter king counts about dreams crushed each year in nfl training camps then lets one of the rejected players ross tucker describe what it felt like to be let go by the washington redskins "i knew this was a bottom line business and the bottom line was they didnt need me " mr tucker writes "interestingly enough the only time i got even a little bit emotional was when i spoke to the owner of the redskins daniel snyder for the first time in my life i asked mr snyders assistant if i could thank the redskins owner for the opportunities he had given me in his office i choked up a bit as i said thank you so much for giving an undrafted free agent rookie from princeton an opportunity in you really changed my life its true the redskins gave me my first and my last chance at my dream in an attempt to lighten the mood i told mr snyder i still had one claim to fame i am pretty sure that i am the only year old princeton grad that has been fired five times already he laughed " its another kind of football but similar emotions for british soccer players "if only i had another profession to fall back on the way ive been feeling about football the last six months id jack it in " one of the rejected players

rugby world cup against the u s without jonny wilkinson star of englands world cup triumph times of london columnist simon barnes considers "the ever increasing fragility of sporting heroes physically and mentally they break down again and again the reason for this can only be the stresses they are under we test them to breaking point we marvel at what they can do and when they do eventually break down we are daft enough to be surprised perhaps games are not supposed to be played as often and as hard as a modern athlete must play them with bodies bigger stronger and faster than they ever were before it is hardly surprising that the infrastructure of the body gives way beneath the strain " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com
