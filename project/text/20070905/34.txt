dress barns bold wager appears to be paying off new york if dress barn inc has long been one of wall streets best kept secrets the company may have finally outdone itself for years the suffern n y retailers namesake chain of womens clothing stores had been prized by risk averse investors for its strict eye on costs and dependable cash flow but in late the company bought a duluth minn chain called maurices for &# million vowing to add new stores aggressively executives said mauricess higher margin business would boost long term profit growth for the once sleepy dress barn by all accounts dress barns bold move has paid off for the fiscal year ended in july analysts expect the company will post net income of &# million on revenue of &# billion thats more than triple the profits dress barn posted for fiscal when it had &# million in sales operating margin is forecast at about for the fiscal year just ended versus three years earlier executives say maurices still has room to boost the companys overall profitability fast growing maurices which now accounts for a third of the companys sales and of its operating profit is the key to understanding dress barn and the future of its business yet enthusiasts complain that it remains a cipher to most investors one big reason is that the chains more than middle market clothing shops which are adding about locations a year and span more than states are concentrated in small towns that are mostly away from the coasts "the stores are so far from major metropolitan areas its difficult for investors to kick the tires " says mark montagna an analyst at cl king &amp associates in new york "the average individual investor still probably doesnt even know what maurices is " a multiyear rally in dress barn shares turbocharged by growth at maurices sent them to an all time high above &# in may more than double their value before the acquisition but dress barn has seen a bumpy ride since having hit a week high of &# last december the shares recently were around &# up from a week low of &# set last month on top of the markets recent selloff dress barn shares were hurt this spring by bumpy sales at the dress barn chain which the company partly blamed on bad weather maurices meanwhile has delivered double digit gains since may dress barns choppy performance has spurred a defection by some investors who had piled into its stock following the maurices acquisition says steven schuster a portfolio manager at cramer rosenthal mcglynn llc a new york investment firm that owns more than three million shares but those defectors have been steadily replaced by a more value minded set he says peers in the specialty womens clothing business such as chicos fas inc talbots inc and coldwater creek inc have been hit by fashion missteps as their clientele has become increasingly picky amid concerns about their personal finances but dress barn has been a relatively steady performer of late having raised its earnings outlook at the end of may yet its stock price as a multiple of earnings forecasts is just versus for its peers according to factset mr schuster predicts that on top of a recent round of aggressive share buybacks he expects dress barn to continue this fall maurices will continue to fuel impressive gains in sales and profit "earnings growth will be higher than the street expects this year and its multiple will eventually reflect that " he says a key reason to believe this bulls say is mauricess move in june to exit its mens apparel business and replace it with plus size womens apparel a highly profitable and fast growing niche that dress barn stores have worked for years the laggard mens business which had been in about two thirds of mauricess stores and occupied of its floor space was generating about &# a square foot in annual sales well short of the chains average of &# already the new plus size merchandise is exceeding that rate executives say with sales of &# a square foot for the year just ended maurices is expected to reach &# a square foot within the next two to three years the company says dress barn reports its sales figures separately the dress barn chain which generated &# a square foot last year also aims for &# a square foot as it continues to improve its merchandise inventory control although it will likely take longer to reach that goal these arent impressive numbers by most standards chicos stores for instance can generate sales of more than &# a square foot but the rock bottom rents for mauricess small town stores allow them to generate big profits on relatively small sales president and chief executive david r jaffe also addressed a few misperceptions about the maurices chain noting that the maurices stores which target women in their s are midprice and dont compete with small town discounters like charming shoppes inc or cato corp in fact maurices prefers to share strip centers with big discounters like wal mart stores inc and target corp siphoning away shoppers investors might be surprised how effectively maurices competes with kohls corp and j c penney co mr jaffe says mauricess goal of spanning at least stores is "eminently doable " mr jaffe adds stores that recently have been added in larger suburban and "metro fringe" markets have been a success and maurices is expanding quickly in texas and new york and will enter florida and california within the next to months he says maurices wont necessarily be the companys only growth vehicle in the coming years dress barn is compiling a list of possible acquisition candidates mr jaffe says "weve been aggressively pursuing opportunities " he says "but were really holding off to find just the right fit "
