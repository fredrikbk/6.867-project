politics &amp economics republican forecast cloudy partys woes go beyond bush as it bleeds support among key groups washington for republicans hoping the campaign will bring a fresh start after the troubled tenure of president bush there are sobering signs evidence indicates that the partys problems with the american electorate are much bigger than the president and wont go away when he leaves office recent voter surveys including private polling done by a leading republican strategist suggest a broader erosion of republicans appeal in particular three groups crucial to mr bushs goal of a "permanent republican majority" are drifting away younger voters hispanics and independents the reasons include the iraq war conservatives emphasis on social issues such as gay marriage abortion and stem cell research and a party led backlash against illegal immigrants that has left many hispanic and asian american citizens feeling unwelcome the upshot is that republicans face structural problems that stem from generational demographic and societal changes and arent easily overcome without changing fundamental party positions longtime republican pollster tony fabrizio this year conducted an exhaustive survey of his partys voters to update one he did in he found that the party is significantly older and more conservative than it was a decade ago that he says suggests a republican party increasingly at risk of being seen "as very old fashioned very old and not in touch with the realities of todays society " those problems contributed to republicans loss of control of congress last year overall though republicans defections to date havent necessarily been the democratic partys gains many renegade republicans instead are declaring independence of either party and becoming swing voters susan murray years old a registered republican of henniker n h says that she is "not at all happy with george bush" and that the party "is just so far right leaning " especially on social issues but the democrats she says "are too far left " so she splits her ballots between the parties mr fabrizio thinks republicans could improve their standing significantly if they find a popular and inspirational presidential candidate "because the perception of a party depends so much on who it nominates for president " with a strong contender he says "those trends are not unstoppable " while polls show significant majorities saying they want a democrat to win the white house next year in head to head matchups of particular republican candidates against new york sen hillary clinton and other democrats the leading republican candidates have run close with former new york mayor rudy giuliani even slightly ahead in some polls but if republican erosion continues the election could confirm a trend away from the period of conservative dominance in u s government and politics that dates back nearly three decades to the partys uncertainties turn on some of the most important groups of voters younger voters represent necessary new blood hispanics are the nations fastest growing demographic group and are concentrated in big states such as florida and california that are keys to presidential victories independents ranks fluctuate but are expanding amid voters disgust with partisanship each party needs them to win elections in the congressional elections democrats won all three groups voters to years old favored democrats over republicans by to exit polls showed hispanics favored democrats to republicans share was percentage points lower than its hispanic vote in congressional elections two years earlier independents went for democrats to in democrats only narrowly got more votes than republicans "the state of the republican party is worse than any time since watergate and arguably this is worse than watergate " says party strategist vin weber a former congressman "because that was about an event whereas this may reflect a trend " republicans recovered quickly after the watergate related losses in and triumphing at all levels of government in and electing ronald reagan in to usher in the conservative era the forces now at work already have hurt republicans in mr reagans california home to many hispanics social liberals the young and those always trying to be young now democrats are making inroads in other once reliably republican states among them florida virginia arizona new mexico colorado montana and even mr bushs texas mark penn chief strategist for sen clinton says democrats are regaining hispanics who voted for mr bush and drawing more women and more higher earning voters "how permanent is it that remains to be seen " he says but republicans "have to redefine themselves and typically parties dont do that until theyre forced into the wilderness and someone steps forward to bring them out of the wilderness " in mr fabrizios survey of republicans more than seven out of call themselves conservatives up percentage points from in those who call themselves moderate or liberal republicans have declined points to just a quarter of the party from a decade ago it follows that the survey shows republicans have further declined in the more moderate northeast and gained in the more conservative south now of republicans are southerners while live in the northeast in new hampshire independent voter edith keene illustrates the drift of moderates standing outside an event for mrs clinton she indicates her interest in the democratic field she says she twice voted for mr bush but "now he looks ridiculous " in the fabrizio survey republicans were evenly split between those whose main concerns were economic issues and those whose focus was social and moral issues this year he found the party more segmented in the wake of the terror attacks national security conservatives are back after a lapse with the end of the cold war economic conservatives though are now a much smaller share of the party "moralists " mr fabrizios term for the evangelical conservatives with "laser like focus" against abortion and gay rights remain a quarter of the party just as in but as other groups splinter that now makes moralists the largest of the seven republican subgroups mr fabrizio identifies shaping americans perceptions of todays republican party "it is the moralists whose voices youre hearing " he says thats causing dissonance even within the party by to republicans say the party "has spent too much time focusing on moral issues" rather than economic issues in the current survey of republicans are to years old down from in republicans and older constitute of the party up from a decade ago mr bush initially made gains with younger voters and independents and in drew a larger share of hispanics votes than any republican before him though still less than democratic nominee sen john kerry the president sought to capitalize on those gains in choosing his two second term domestic priorities creating private accounts from social security and overhauling immigration policy both were pursued as much for their perceived political benefits as for any policy merits but both failed the white house argued that private accounts held particular appeal to young voters since many dont believe social security will be around when they retire and to hispanics who tend to be better savers than americans generally the fabrizio survey found that just of republicans are hispanic along with who are black "weve made no progress in years " the pollster says not a good sign "in a nation that is becoming more heavily minority "
