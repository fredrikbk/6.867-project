the informed patient hospitals combat dangerous bedsores new medicare payment rules spur push for prevention the four eyed body check every two hours olympics style theme music is piped over the audio system at osf st francis medical center in peoria ill signaling to hospital staff that its time to perform a vital task repositioning patients in their beds to avoid wear and tear on sensitive skin hospitals around the country are scrambling to put new programs in place to prevent pressure ulcers commonly known as bedsores after the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services announced last month that as of october it will no longer reimburse hospitals for treating eight "reasonably preventable" conditions pressure ulcers are among the most prevalent costly and dangerous on the list in addition to interfering with recovery lengthening hospital stays and causing extreme pain and discomfort pressure ulcers can increase the risk of infection with nearly deaths annually from hospital acquired pressure ulcers nursing homes and long term care facilities have made strides of their own in prevention motivated in part by the costs of litigation for failure to prevent pressure ulcers but in acute care hospitals where patients stay for much shorter periods prevention has been sporadic acute care hospitals treat about million pressure ulcers each year and as many as of hospitalized patients may have pressure ulcers at any one time according to the institute for healthcare improvement estimates for the cost of treating all pressure ulcers in the u s range up to &# billion annually to combat this hospitals are pushing screenings of all incoming patients from head to toe for skin issues that could lead to pressure ulcers they are using visual examinations ultrasound and other technologies that can help identify skin with tissue damage in some cases they are photographing areas of a patients skin to document how it changes from day to day hospitals are also buying special beds with high tech air mattresses that minimize or redistribute pressure and they are adhering to strict monitoring schedules that include shifting patients every two hours frequently cleaning and moisturizing soiled or sensitive skin and making sure that at risk patients have enough protein and other nutrients in their diet to help the healing process pressure ulcers are caused when skin lesions form near prominent bony parts of the body from unrelieved pressure when patients stay in one position for too long starting with skin redness or a blister sores can progress to a deep crater that damages muscles tendons and bone requiring surgery and increasing the risk of complications such as the bloodstream infection sepsis the late actor christopher reeve was being treated for an infection associated with a pressure ulcer when he died of cardiac arrest in elderly or disabled patients sores can begin forming in as little as two to six hours but pressure ulcers also can develop in much younger and healthier patients on the skin of the tailbone back buttocks heels back of the head or elbows poor nutrition or dehydration can weaken the skin and make it more vulnerable in february the national pressure advisory panel npuap org updated its definition of the original four "stages" used to diagnose pressure ulcers and added two new stages on deep tissue injury and unstageable pressure ulcers advisory panels in both the u s and europe are updating guidelines in several languages through a joint project pressureulcerguidelines org a number of quality groups including the nonprofit institute for healthcare improvement and vha inc an alliance of not for profit hospitals in the u s are working with hospitals on the new prevention programs using lessons learned from osf st francis and others that have sharply reduced or even eliminated pressure ulcers to be sure patients often arrive at the hospital with pre existing skin lesions and researchers say some ulcers may simply be unavoidable in patients with severe disabilities or compromised immune systems generally however experts agree that bedsores are a classic example of preventable harm despite strong evidence of effective strategies for prevention guidelines are frequently ignored or overlooked part of the problem is a nationwide nursing shortage that makes for a more harried and chaotic hospital environment but there has also been no real incentive for prevention programs since medicare and private insurers typically pay for complications that arise once a patient is in the hospital that is changing with the advent of medicares new payment policy which some private insurers are considering following in addition to pressure ulcers the preventable conditions for which medicare will no longer reimburse hospitals include injuries from patient falls urinary tract infections vascular catheter associated infections and mediastinitis an infection following heart surgery also included are so called never events meaning they never should happen objects left in the body during surgery air embolisms and blood incompatibility medicare plans to add three additional conditions next year last year there were cases of pressure ulcers as a "secondary diagnosis" in addition to the primary reason the patient entered the hospital reported in medicare patients the cost of treating a severe pressure ulcer with complications that require surgery can be as high as &# studies show critics of medicares new rules say unreimbursed costs for pressure ulcer treatment will simply be passed along in higher medical charges for everyone but medicare counters that the new policy will give hospitals a strong incentive to screen patients who may be at risk if hospitals can document that the skin ulcer was present at admission it will pay for treatment owensboro medical health system in kentucky began a program in that included putting pictures of clouds on the doors of at risk patients to remind nurses to reposition them in their beds every two hours but a study in found it hadnt made a dent in reducing pressure ulcers joni sims a nurse and director of medical surgical services says nurses werent all adhering to the turn schedules and some patients who were at risk didnt get the cloud symbols the hospital switched to turn clocks in each patients room with a clearly marked schedule for turning patients every two hours it also provided nurses assistants with pagers to remind them of turn times byron morris a nurse at owensboro says that the assistants help by repositioning patients if the nurse is busy the paging system "can be unnerving but its all worth it in the end " he adds "a little prevention goes a long way " the hospital had also been using inflatable air mattresses that patients would take home at discharge charging the bedding to patients hospital bills but after a pilot program showed a sharp reduction in pressure ulcers in two units that used pressure relieving mattresses the hospital spent &# to buy atmosair mattresses supplied by san antonio based kinetic concepts inc as permanent medical equipment for the hospital owensboro has reduced the incidence of skin breakdown at the hospital to of patients from in preventing an estimated pressure ulcers from march to march that comes to a savings of as much as &# million on treatment costs and &# in supply costs "not to mention the harm to patients weve prevented " says ms sims last month the hospital initiated a policy requiring that all patients undergo a "four eyed body check" on admission with two nurses checking patients from head to toe patients can refuse but the refusal will be documented in the medical record the atmosair mattress has a system of valves that allows air to move between cushions to adjust to the patient weight and minimize pressure hospitals can rent or purchase the mattresses which cost about &# each lynne sly president of kinetic concepts therapeutic surfaces division says families and caregivers can help by asking if hospitals are following prevention programs and by asking for special beds "if an elderly patient who is pounds and thin skinned is admitted to the hospital the family or caregiver should be asking what alternatives they have " ms sly advises collaborative efforts among groups of hospitals also show promise a two year effort sponsored by the new jersey hospital association with hospitals nursing homes and home care agencies had reduced the incidence of new pressure ulcers by as of last month participants adhered to guidelines that included performing a complete skin assessment within eight hours of admission evaluating patients nutritional status and repositioning patients frequently aline holmes the associations senior vice president of clinical affairs says in some cases hospitals found that patients in operating rooms werent positioned carefully or placed on surfaces with adequate padding and in other cases frail elderly patients were being held in emergency rooms for a long period of time on thin mattresses that exacerbated conditions in already frail skin hospitals
