anything is possible like actually enjoying a good digital read if the jetsons have taught us anything its that in the future paper will be a thing of the past and everything we read will be on a computer screen this isnt just about work that future is already here thanks first to word processing and then to the internet its about reading for pleasure too the sort now done sprawled on the couch with a favorite book or magazine and a cat on the lap most people beyond a certain age would regard reading for pleasure on a computer an oxymoron the machine is associated with the office and nothing quite takes your mind off a detective novel than having an email alert pop up the ergonomics are all wrong too the eyes get tired and even an aeron chair has nothing on a good recliner no wonder most people still print out anything long they need to read carefully all this though is slowly starting to change there are new ways to read old things both the internet archives archive org and project gutenberg gutenberg org allow you to download entire books free of charge usually those no longer under copyright either as text or as scanned images the free not for profit million book project is a work in progress at ulib org the big tech companies have discovered books google and microsoft are busy scanning libraries putting them on the web and making them searchable and when you buy selected titles from booksellers such as amazon com and oreilly com you can pay a few dollars more and start reading them right away online newspapers of course have long made available text searches of old published stories now many magazines have digitized archives that present old issues on the screen just as they looked on paper the new yorker has been selling its complete library for two years the years of harpers are online free for subscribers in november bondi publishing will market digital versions of all old issues of rolling stone and playboy laptops which you can unplug and haul over to the couch are becoming equal to the task of pleasure reading on my inch wide laptop screen side by side pages of the digital new yorker are sufficiently readable to allow you to flip casually through them just like youd do with the real thing even better than a laptop for casual reading at least for books would be a digital reader the size of a book itself alas there have been so many failed attempts at these e books that theyve acquired a reputation as like in the old joke a technology of the future that always will be but in the past year there has been another go at digital readers thanks to an innovative screen technology from a cambridge company called e ink this display is monochrome and reflects ambient light rather than being back lit like an lcd while you need to be in a fairly bright room for the screen to be easily readable you can also take it outside in the bright sun where it looks its best its resolution is much higher than on a desktop monitor resulting in smooth text without any jaggy edges and since you arent staring into a bright light your eyes dont get as tired sony has been selling an e ink based reader for nearly a year it now sells for &# amazon is rumored to be preparing its own michael lesk of rutgers university said reading researchers like himself know that readers retain information from a screen as well as they do from a printed page but its an open question as to whether the emotional experiences of the two are the same or whether ink stamped on a tactile piece of paper that you hold in your hands somehow makes more of an impact than ghostly letters that flicker on an ever changing screen my own little test using the sony reader to reread "pride and prejudice" suggests it doesnt for the first few minutes i was too aware of the new technology and had trouble concentrating on the story but that didnt last long and i soon settled in laughing and worrying in all the right places at the end i was just as happy for elizabeth bennet as i had been when i first read it in paperback it is a truth universally unacknowledged that reading a book for pleasure involves a lot of hard work you have to fight to keep it open and pressed flat and just when youve comfortably arranged everything you have to turn the page and start all over again naturally you need to do all this without bothering the cat you may not appreciate these difficulties only because youve never had an alternative to a book for comparison the sony reader is slim light and can be held in one hand to go to the next page you just nudge it with your thumb yes there are things not to like about reading for pleasure on a computer screen even for generic text only paperbacks you have to forgo the stories that books themselves can tell with all their stains and scribbles and when youre done reading you dont get to put another trophy on your bookshelf in exchange though you get to put an entire bookshelf in your pocket we surrender charm and tradition in return we get convenience and abundance with computers its always the same compromise email me at lee gomes wsj com
