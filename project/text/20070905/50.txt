honeywell puts green into its diesel honeywell international inc unit uop llc is well known in the energy sector for technology used to refine petrochemicals but it lately has been touting its work with more mundane substances vegetable oil and animal fat the push is designed to keep uop ahead of the curve not to mention competitors at a time when interest in alternative fuels remains high and energy companies are being prodded to produce more petroleum "is here to stay " said jennifer holmgren director of uops month old renewable energy and chemicals business but "what you want to head toward is feedstock diversity we want to bring feedstock diversity into the refinery " in june uop and italian oil company eni spa announced that eni will build a plant in italy to produce "green" diesel fuel from vegetable oil beginning in using a refining process jointly developed by uop and eni uop which is licensing the technology to others anticipates a similar announcement for construction of a u s plant by the end of this year although uop declined to disclose the company involved while the initial eni facility will rely on vegetable oil as its feedstock ms holmgren said the process works with any type of grease or animal fat provided it is cleaned beforehand she also said the source of vegetable oil whether soy grapeseed or other plants doesnt matter "our technology can convert all of that into a very high quality diesel fuel " she said uop is hardly alone in exploring non petroleum sources of diesel a more energy efficient fuel than gasoline "biodiesel" derived from grease or vegetable oil using a different chemical process is sold in the u s but biodiesel is blended with conventional diesel at relatively low percentages and it cant be transported or stored with conventional diesel conversely uops green diesel also known as renewable diesel can be used as a replacement for conventional diesel in standard diesel autos or as a blend and it can be transported and stored with it several competitors including conocophillips and neste oil have plans to produce their own varieties of renewable diesel although the fuels arent commercially available yet even when they are available economics could be an obstacle to widespread use based on current prices for vegetable oils ms holmgren estimated that crude oil would have to hit &# to &# a barrel for uops green diesel to be cost competitive with conventional diesel without any government subsidies crude has been trading around &# a barrel ms holmgren expects uops technology to find a significant niche as companies strive to meet growing global mandates for the use of alternative fuels she also noted refiners feedstock costs either for crude or for vegetable oil rise and fall which will render green diesel more or less economical bob mccormick an engineer and biodiesel researcher at the national renewable energy laboratory in golden colo called the effort by uop and others to produce green diesel promising although he said an overall analysis of the various fuels environmental benefits hasnt been completed yet but "all these technologies displace petroleum " he said "they displace imported petroleum so theyre good for energy security " traditional biodiesel which accounted for about million gallons or less than of the billion gallons of highway diesel fuel produced in the u s last year has proved to be a "winner" in terms of energy efficiency and the environment he said and the market for it is growing rapidly uop is optimistic its green diesel technology can also be commercially successful although the company declined to provide market projections uop is forecasting about &# billion in total revenue this year only an insignificant amount of which will come from its renewable fuels push in addition to the green diesel effort uop has been working on various other renewable energy technologies including a government backed effort to make jet fuel from vegetable or algae oils "we want to create a multitude of products fuels and chemicals" from renewable feedstocks ms holmgren said "our goal is really to develop a slate of technologies to really do exactly what we do in the refinery " using renewable feedstocks
