fiscally fit home buyers on the fence its a buyers market but some are anxious that home prices may drop even lower online edition i recently wrote about how the mortgage crunch is playing out among homeowners in my area in response some readers wanted to know if they should buy a home now or wait in case prices fall lower its not a decision to be taken lightly prospective homebuyers who arent likely to be in their homes long enough to weather the downturn could end up "under water" owing more on a mortgage than a homes market value my husband gerry faced a similar decision years ago he started shopping for homes in early after the late s housing market implosion gerry was sitting on &# in a low interest savings account and older friends whom he respected were urging him to invest in a house prices were still declining from the bust and interest rates on a fixed year mortgage were hovering around not bad when compared with double digit rates in the s gerrys parents urged him to wait they felt home prices would go a lot lower than the &# listed for three bedroom one and a half bath homes he had his eye on in our central new jersey community because gerry was such a diligent saver he had a substantial down payment and didnt worry so much about being underwater on his mortgage we talked it over and despite his parents concerns gerry decided to buy a home because he intended to stay put for at least seven years he decided not to worry about where prices were heading it worked out after eight years when he sold the house to buy his fathers home he walked away with about &# in profit so how likely is it that gerrys scenario will play out for todays would be home buyers its tough to say since the housing market is facing a downturn that is steeper than we experienced in the early s indeed recent data on the housing market paints a stark picture home prices are declining in many regions nationwide last month the national association of realtors projected that existing home sales will fall this year while new home sales are likely to fall at the same time foreclosures are soaring according to data provider realtytrac foreclosure filings are up in july from the previous year or one foreclosure filing for every households foreclosed homes are hitting many housing markets already saturated with unsold inventory inventories of homes for sale in july rose to million or about months of supply at the current sales pace a six month supply of homes for sale is generally the norm in a balanced market for homeowners trying to sell the news is expected to get worse wall street has been burned by bad subprime loans and is curtailing new investment in mortgage lenders as a result consumers without stellar credit may be unable to get mortgages at reasonable rates all of these factors combined are expected to continue to weigh on home prices so what does this all mean for buyers sitting on the fence if youre unsure whether youre ready to buy first consider your outlook conventional wisdom says that homeowners who are likely to be in a home for at least seven years will see prices rise if youre going to want to or have to sell the home in the next three years when some markets may still be suffering the mortgage mess fallout consider renting its true renting has its own costs but you wont pay closing costs real estate agent fees and myriad other expenses incurred when buying owning and selling a home renting also may allow you to save for a larger down payment potentially eliminating the need to pay for private mortgage insurance when youre ready to buy get help with the rent vs buy calculations here if the only way to afford the home you want is to finance it with an adjustable rate mortgage id be wary of buying now some readers over the years have taken me to task for being overly conservative by recommending fixed rate mortgages arms worked for many during the housing boom when home price appreciation built enough equity to allow homeowners to refinance amid the bust many arm holders are finding they cant refinance because theyre underwater with their mortgages sadly many are losing their homes in foreclosure because they used arms to buy homes they really couldnt afford before shopping for homes figure out how much home you can afford here if your finances are solid and you can afford the home you want with a conventional mortgage and youre buying for long haul the time may be right and for some buyers the market is secondary to the reality of family life the impending arrival of a new baby may be the deciding factor to whether now is the "right time" to buy one big factor in gerrys decision to buy a home was the desire to start building our lives together when shopping for homes where the market is weak consider buying a newly built home home builders are hoping to lure buyers with discounts of as much as and other valuable incentives such as granite countertops luxury appliances and in ground pools the national association of home builders reports that of builders are offering financial incentives up from about a year ago the best deals will often be found where home price declines are the worst but given the severity of the conditions behind the current downturn the regions that saw the most heady gains during the housing boom particularly arizona california and florida may take more time to rebound in other areas of the country most notably detroit the local economy is contributing to home price declines in these areas its particularly important to know whether youll need to sell quickly or not there are markets where home prices continue to show steady growth including seattle atlanta and dallas according to standard &amp poors if youre shopping in these regions youll find the best values if you prove yourself to be a qualified buyer who can quickly close the deal that means getting your mortgage pre approved where you have a written guarantee that youll get the loan for the amount you need also it would help to avoid placing contingencies on the sale such as the need to sell an old home before closing on the new one there are enough contingencies in the market right now without adding too many more is now the right time to buy a home or should buyers wait for lower prices and sweeter incentives id be interested to hear from other
