modern and muslim in turbulent pakistan start ups drive a boom fast growing economy lures entrepreneurs liposuction and pilates islamabad pakistan pakistans political scene is growing more clouded but a clear demonstration of confidence in the countrys future is coming from an emerging economic force entrepreneurs scores of new businesses once unseen in pakistan from fitness studios to chic coffee shops to hair transplant centers are springing up in the wake of a dramatic economic expansion as a result new wealth and unprecedented consumer choice have become part of pakistans volatile social mix volatility has erupted often in recent weeks yesterday two bombs exploded outside this city killing people adding to the political uncertainty is the expected return monday from exile of former prime minister nawaz sharif who was ousted in a military coup led by pervez musharraf to counter that challenge president musharraf is close to sealing a power sharing pact with another former prime minister benazir bhutto the two aim to join forces in a government that would take on islamic extremists who have recently launched a series of suicide attacks around pakistan clashes between militants and security forces have pushed pakistan toward an uncertain future but they have largely overshadowed some of the broader changes taking place a new class of entrepreneurs is emerging who in small but significant ways have challenged the religious orthodoxy they provide a stark counterpoint to the rising islamic radicalism that the u s and others view as a threat to pakistans position as a staunch western ally and with many importing ideas from abroad they are contributing to pakistans st century search for itself "can you be modern and muslim how is pakistan going to link into the global economy " asks ali cheema an economics professor at lahore university of management sciences who has researched pakistans entrepreneurs "these people are posing important questions " by sheer demographic weight the younger generation will determine pakistans direction of its million people million are under the age of many are rural poor and unprepared for a role in the global economy but fast economic growth has also drawn more men and women to the cities propelling some up the income ladder through education and new jobs on a recent summer afternoon clerics from a muslim seminary here walked across the street to a new boutique which purports to be the first couture store in islamabad the bearded men clad in white cotton tunics and trousers were patrolling the neighborhood for signs of moral laxity upon entering the store they walked over to a rack of slinky shirts "our women dont wear such clothes " declared one of the visitors "youre right " replied yasser anees the boutiques year old co owner "those are for men " the patrol soon departed overall the entrepreneurial class remains a sliver just over a million people by some estimates much of the business is confined to pockets of urban wealth that most pakistanis wont experience in their lifetimes and yet the brief business careers of many entrepreneurs show how rapidly dramatic change can unfold in pakistan that change also helps explain why gen musharraf remains relatively popular among this group following recent events that have engulfed his government in turmoil gen musharraf can use all the support he can get his efforts earlier this year to oust the countrys supreme court chief which were unsuccessful provoked months of street protests from people worried about the loss of civil liberties many of them from pakistans new middle class meanwhile many fear the country has become less safe the pakistani army has battled militants in the northwest and on the border with afghanistan which is where the u s government believes tribal chieftains harbor key figures of al qaeda possibly including osama bin laden in july pakistani security forces raided a heavily fortified mosque in islamabad killing dozens of armed militants with pakistans past leaders preparing to return from exile the turmoil is likely to intensify mr sharif and ms bhutto will be coming back to a country that is much different economically at least from the one they left since mr musharrafs coup in pakistan has become one of asias fastest growing economies in the past eight years sales of cars have climbed annually televisions and air conditioners over the past four years economic growth has averaged according to government figures the consumer driven growth has signaled the spread of a middle class in pakistans biggest cities for decades after independence in a handful of extremely wealthy industrial families dominated the economy in the s nationalization of important industries gave the government a major economic role in recent years a privatization program has sought to shrink the states hand while introducing more investment and competition pakistan now permits foreign ownership of its banks prompting more consumer friendly lending for home mortgages and cars meanwhile a telecommunications monopoly has been broken up and policies have been tweaked to reduce user fees cellular subscribers have expanded a year since government economists boast that these changes greater access to credit and more mobile phone and internet connections have ushered people into the economic and social mainstream "millions of young people now have a way to escape from poverty and get away from extremism " says salman shah an economic adviser to the prime minister not all are convinced the economic traction is sustainable though while pakistan has seen an unprecedented consumer boom inflation and a sluggish job market have undercut modest income gains contends abn amros senior economist in islamabad sakib sherani in luring new industries and cultivating a broad based business class that will keep the economy globally competitive pakistan lags behind countries such as vietnam as well as china and india mr sherani says many critics also contend that substantial amounts of u s assistance estimated at more than &# billion a year may be the biggest underlying reason why pakistans economy is doing well but the economy is also sprouting from the bottom thanks to seed capital from abroad and more credit friendly banks last fiscal year pakistan received a record &# billion in foreign direct investment the government says overseas remittances which are what pakistanis are returning from bank accounts overseas hit &# billion in the same period also a record in the past many entrepreneurs would need to rely on family or unethical money lenders who would sometimes break a leg "maybe two" if not paid says sardar usman rashid chief of the credit division for the sme bank a government arm that lends to small and medium size companies more choices are available now this year sme bank expects to extend about loans ranging from &# to &# million up from about last year larger banks are now wading into a loan market for small and medium size companies valued at about &# billion according to mr rashid "banks are not so shy about lending to the small guy " he says signs of how this change is rippling through the economy are evident on bustling mm alam road in lahore a decade ago asma shah opened a small store that centered on novelty scented candles in ms shah a british citizen of pakistani origin sold her apartment in london and brought the capital back to finance a big expansion of her store called "candelicious " shes imported silk throw pillows from

brochures for a new health club ms shahs sister in law is opening "body &amp soul" will offer personal trainers yoga and pilates a popular physical fitness regime the studio promises to "keep you

road some are franchises brought back from overseas by entrepreneurs who believed they spotted a market for the same business at home in the past customers would have splurged for a hair transplant trip to the u s or europe but now options are close at home says tahir mahmood country manager for the international laser hair transplant surgery center in lahore "there are quite a few bald people in pakistan " he says "we have helped the nation by keeping the revenue here " new niches in pakistans economy have created space for people like haroon qureshi a year old self employed private wealth manager in t shirt and jeans smoking benson &amp hedges cigarettes mr qureshi recounts how earlier this year he made money for clients by buying and selling the same square yard plot of land twice those transactions earned him &# in days he says real estate prices have rocketed in pakistans big cities and on the fringes as development pushes outward mr qureshi believes the social change that has accompanied pakistans economic growth is spreading widely and cant be rolled back on an early august evening he sits in masooms pancake lounge one of two coffeehouses in lahore started by a husband and wife team returned from reno nev its filled with twenty somethings drinking cappuccino and listening to loud music over the din of hot chocolates song "you sexy thing " mr qureshi credits such achievements to pakistans top leader gen musharraf "for our emerging economy " he shouts "we need an army man right now " gen musharrafs policies also have been good to mr anees the fashion designer and co owner of the islamabad boutique after graduating from high school mr anees says his only ambitions were hanging out with friends and wearing cool clothes the problem was that he couldnt find the clothes he saw in indias bollywood movies so he ended up drawing the designs from some foreign glossy magazines that he says were beginning to come into the country in while mr anees was still a student gen musharraf showed up as chief guest at a fashion show that helped launch mr aneess designs a year ago mr anees and his fashion school classmate year old atif ali founded their boutique called "at yas " in june fashion tv pakistan one of dozens of private television channels that have popped up since gen musharraf came to power covered the first fashion show of at yas after the show mr anees says the at yas team received a message from local clerics via an at yas employee "they told us to watch our step " he says the owners built a brick wall to obscure their glass showroom they hired a guard with a pump action shotgun to stand outside the store though they describe their clothes as "classic " at yas designers give them flourishes there are billowy harem pants and see through tops made from pakistani chiffon many items are priced above &# a lofty sum in a country where per capita income is still under &# a year business has been brisk the owners say they can barely keep up with orders for lavishly embroidered bridal gowns in a nod toward the countrys conservative crosswinds they plan a line of designer burqas which will fit more snugly than the typical head to toe gowns some shoppers see at yas clothes as too racy for formal occasions and too dressy for more relaxed social gatherings at the store earlier in the day one young woman complained that she wanted something traditional or modern not something in between an hour later she was squeezing through the door with a full bag "thats typical " says mr anees "people change their minds after they come to our store happens all the time "
