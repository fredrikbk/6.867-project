shes on the road to renown years ago working at a boston radio station i was often at ringside covering boxing bouts i regularly saw exceptionally skilled local fighters who never broke through to become headliners in the trade they were called "club fighters " similarly in jazz there have always been regional players respected by their peers who never became widely known coming off a road trip coleman hawkins the inventor of the jazz tenor saxophone would tell me about some of those "club jazzmen " amanda carr a true jazz singer in a time of wannabes after playing gigs around new england for years is now getting national and international recognition that will increase with the release of her new cd "amanda carr soon" oms records available at amazon com and cdbaby also a pianist and composer she sings and swings with the unaffected confidence of a genuine jazz improviser unlike some of the present alleged jazz vocalists ms carr does not try to imitate a horn she is an authentic musician in the front line with her longtime colleagues on "soon" guitarist john wilkins bassist bronek suchanek and drummer kenny hadley who produced the album also present is exuberant tenor saxophonist arnie krakowsky ive rarely heard a jazz singer fuse so naturally and pleasurably with what are ordinarily called "sidemen " in this group sound there is a lilting often soaring confluence of jazz time in a repertory that ranges from george and ira gershwins "soon" and a c jobims brazilian ballad "if you never come to me " to fats wallers "squeeze me " amanda carr is both a daughter and granddaughter of jazz in the s her grandmother played stride piano for vaudeville acts and her mother nancy carr sang regularly at the totem pole ballroom in newton mass where as i remember there was a huge chandelier adding multiple colors to the romantic ambience on the dance floor trumpet player nick capezuto amandas father is a veteran of the big band era having played with glenn miller larry clinton louis prima elliot lawrence woody herman and herb pomeroy who for years was a prime regenerator of the boston jazz scene as amanda proudly tells me "there are a handful of us in the boston area who are sons and daughters of the working jazz players of the s s and s we have an unofficial obligation to carry on a musical legacy " now she continues "we are the younger set with the old school attitude the ones that dress just a little bit better and show up a little bit earlier were the ones who work sick because you dont sub out unless youre dead we drive miles for a hundred bucks " amandas first steady gig when she was was at a restaurant bar in her hometown of hingham mass for &# a night a pianist as well as a singer she furthered her apprenticeship in dance nightclubs in the boston area after filling in for her mother on some big band gigs she began as she puts it to feel an affinity for that genre of which jazz was then an integral force in she recorded her first album "carr toons " on which she felt honored to have herb pomeroy play she told him defensively "im not really a jazz singer" but an italian producer upon hearing the cd thought otherwise he invited her to be a headliner at the eurojazz festival in turin with her on stage were famed tenor saxophonist james moody and bassist george mraz having been a hit in turin amanda was invited back the next year to record a live concert with an italian trio that had accompanied her at her international debut in recent years amanda has toured this country as a featured vocalist with "ghost" bands revivals of bands originally led by artie shaw harry james and glenn miller amanda has also occasionally starred in a traveling "tribute to peggy lee and benny goodman" with the everett longstreth piece band the show starts a nationwide tour in september of next year like all the durable jazz musicians ive known amanda keeps surprising and delighting herself with how much she has to keep learning "like " she tells me "theres so much more room between notes than when i began more subtle play and less need to break out every tool in the box to showcase good singing its having the sense of restraint and especially the concept of the group sound and homage to the element of space that shapes phrasing as much as the notes you never see the end of the journey " hearing amanda tell of what shes learned on her journey through jazz i remember dizzy gillespie saying to me "its taken me most of my life to know which notes not to play " since the music on "soon" is so satisfyingly a group creation the other players credits should be cited guitarist john wilkins has performed with clark terry the kenny hadley big band and the artie shaw orchestra mr hadley one of new englands first call drummers has worked with master teacher dizzy gillespie exemplifying jazz as an international language bassist bronek suchanek was trained at a polish conservatory but took the risk at the time of listening intently to jazz he left his native land for sweden where he worked with such american originals as thad jones mel lewis and don cherry he now lives in the land where jazz began tenor saxophonist arnie krakowsky whose room filling presence would have delighted coleman hawkins has worked with ray charles mel torme and a variety of jazz and latin combos of his association with amanda he says "were playing for each other and relating to what went down in the past when you die and get to where youre going all the masters are going to be there today everybodys sound is predicated on being famous and much of it sounds the same its completely opposite of what this craft is supposed to be " on a previous amanda carr cd "tender trap " theres one of my favorite and seldom played duke ellington songs "what am i here for " all the players on "soon" know the answer to that question mr hentoff covers jazz for the journal
