housing slump strains budgets of states cities tremors from the housing markets slump are straining the budgets of state and local governments from coast to coast sending officials scrambling to plug gaps rising defaults on subprime home loans are boosting the inventory of unsold homes and driving sale prices lower thats cutting into housing related revenues from building permit fees taxes on contracting and recording property transfers and even sales taxes as a result legislators in florida which was at the forefront of the housing boom plan a special session this month to consider deep budget cuts to offset a projected &# billion funding gap california forecasts a shortfall of at least &# billion in next years budget and chicago faces a &# million gap in its &# billion budget for in the kansas city mo area more than two dozen agencies that serve the homeless are likely to lose at least some of their funding this year meanwhile the tiny town of sultan wash near seattle has had to lay off the janitor at city hall forcing office workers to take over bathroom cleaning duties in many cases budget officials knew that the fast pace of housing related revenue growth in recent years wasnt sustainable but the extent of the slowdown has sometimes surprised them unlike the federal government states and local governments generally balance their budgets that means sudden revenue shortfalls can translate into serious cutbacks in spending plans "our forecasts for the last couple of years have been building in a decline" of revenue as the economy headed toward a soft landing says amy baker coordinator of the florida legislatures office of economic and demographic research "what we discovered when we met in and then spring is that the decline was actually occurring more rapidly than we thought " among other effects the housing slump has caused a decline in revenue from real estate transaction taxes which are based on sales prices such taxes typically account for a small percentage of state income but can contribute enough for a sudden shortfall to turn a surplus into a deficit collections are down amid a decline in the overall number of home sales and an increase in houses in foreclosure which typically are sold for less than homeowners might otherwise have received sales tax revenues have also declined a side effect of the housing slump that has blindsided many states and municipalities states are collecting less in sales tax which can account for as much as to of their total revenue partly because builders have cut back on buying construction materials and fewer homeowners have been withdrawing equity from their homes to remodel or buy furnishings homeowners struggling to pay mortgages have even less incentive to splurge states blame weak real estate sales for lower than expected spending on cars and other big ticket items their budget problems could worsen when property tax assessments catch up with the rapid decline in housing prices over the past year or so something that hasnt yet happened in most parts of the country still the outlook for states doesnt appear as dire as in then following recession and the sept terrorist attacks states had to slash a total of &# billion from their budgets some even saw their annual budgets decline from the previous year the fiscal problems were largely resolved by helped by a general economic rebound a real estate boom and higher revenue from corporate income taxes more than half of states recorded higher than expected revenue last year allowing them to undertake new spending projects and build up rainy day funds much of the spending increase has gone toward health care which accounts for about a third of state expenditures in various forms states also had been reversing significant across the board cuts made from through this year however many state budget officials have been preparing for slower growth and recognize that rising expenses for such things as health care education employee pensions and infrastructure may get tougher to meet according to a june report from the national governors association and national association of state budget officers in most places the next stage is more likely to be slower spending growth than an outright spending cut in the longer term however leaner times may lie ahead even though some data show home prices are falling sharply homeowners in most parts of the nation have yet to see their property taxes decline in states like california and indiana some counties already are seeing a record number of homeowners protesting their assessments residents are upset that their property taxes are still rising as market prices decline in the indianapolis area disgruntled homeowners have held rallies outside the indiana governors residence to protest property taxes in response the governor has set up a commission headed by a former state supreme court justice to try to streamline local government and fix problems with property tax assessments which residents complain can seem arbitrary and inconsistent "for its size and population indiana has far too much local government " and thus too many people collecting property taxes according to a report from the governors office the state has more than officials responsible for property tax assessments lower assessments would cut into property tax receipts a crucial source of funding for local governments but which rarely account for more than of state level tax collections "as a nationwide trend youll probably start to see property tax revenues begin to fall next year or the year after " says gerald prante an economist with the tax foundation a nonpartisan research group in washington reduced assessments are already causing budget problems in some areas in virginias fairfax county where almost of county general fund revenue comes from real estate taxes housing prices fell last year for the first time in years foreclosures have jumped and the county wants to hire more appraisers to perform new assessments chicago meanwhile is grappling with lower than expected revenue from real estate sales rising personnel costs and expenses stemming from a harsh winter as home sales have slowed chicago has fallen short of its projections for its real estate transaction tax a levy of on property sales that is paid by a buyer collections of this tax jumped to a record &# million in from &# million in though the city had expected a slowdown this year revised projections show the tax raising only &# million &# million below plan in may chicago announced a broad hiring freeze a furlough day for managers making more than &# and a cut in nonpersonnel spending in july the city ordered an additional spending cut last week mayor richard m daley told city managers who earn more than &# to take another unpaid furlough day this year because these steps saved the city just &# million chicago has to go much further to balance its budget as required by law "while we cant control the housing market there are other things we can control " city budget director bennett j johnson iii says "right now we are looking at everything on the table to find out how we can close this gap " in kansas city agencies that serve the homeless get funding from a &# surcharge jackson county collects on real estate sales documents the county awarded &# to the agencies in february but revenue is falling far short of projections a legislative auditor warned the fund could exhaust its balance by the end of the year and face a &# deficit which would force drastic cuts he suggested increasing the fee by as much as &# a move that would require a public vote smaller locales are getting hurt too sultan a city of roughly people about miles from seattle had been expecting three new subdivisions this year producing fees from building permits but instead sultan has issued just three permits all three subdivision projects have been delayed so the city is likely to receive &# less in building permit fees than it had expected in the northwest housing prices have been stable or rising but sultan city administrator deborah knight says she is hearing about a large supply of homes on the market sultan cut back its building inspector position to part time to save money but that alone didnt bridge the gap now sultan cant afford to employ a custodian at city hall either on june virginia ended its budget year with tax collections that were &# million below its target and the state is expected to miss its current year estimate by &# million virginia gov tim kaine in a recent address to the state legislature said taxes levied on property transfer records fell below the previous years level he asked state agencies to draw up plans for a spending cut sales taxes too have been affected in virginia one quarter to one third of all sales taxes is connected to housing such as taxes on construction expenses and furnishings says state secretary of finance jody wagner after meeting with housing industry executives this summer she said she doesnt expect a quick recovery "if we thought we only had to deal with and then go back to normal we wouldnt be as concerned " ms wagner says "but we think its going to be a prolonged slowdown " some of the states facing the largest shortfalls are those that had the biggest housing booms over the past few years in florida the &# billion shortfall &# million for the last fiscal year and &# billion for this year is nearly all due to the weak housing market says ms baker of the florida legislatures research office though economists knew the states housing run up over the past five years wouldnt continue forever the decline now appears to be sharper and longer lasting than they had expected in the three week special session scheduled to convene sept state senate committees would like to cut the states &# billion budget by in big spending areas such as education and social services meanwhile local governments in florida are considering everything from laying off elementary school crossing guards to raising bus fares "people kept hoping that the good times would continue " ms baker says "when the bubble has burst and were returning to more normal levels and even a little below its just a rude awakening "
