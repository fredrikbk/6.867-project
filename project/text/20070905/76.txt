me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q as my sister considers the mazdaspeed hatchback and the subaru impreza turbo hatchback as her next car we are debating the subarus all wheel drive versus the mazdas front wheel drive is one better at handling and performance carrie noxon houston a both are fun to drive and surprisingly fast but i think the subaru is a better balanced car that will be more pleasant to live with over the long term in general small front wheel drive cars with a lot of horsepower feel sloppy during rapid acceleration as the wheels are overwhelmed with having to steer and direct the engines power to the pavement as the car moves forward weight transfers rearward making the front end "light" and increasing the likelihood of the wheels spinning if traction is unevenly split between the front wheels the car may veer back and forth an effect called "torque steer" all wheel drive distributes the power more evenly and seems to largely cure the problems of overpowered small cars the subaru has also been on the market longer so the chances are better that the bugs have been worked out q i recently purchased a new honda civic hybrid and was surprised at what a hard sell i received on their extended warranty plan i declined but wonder if i made the correct decision bill fishburn cedar rapids iowa a i think you made the right choice i have yet to hear about an extended warranty for a new car that wasnt really a scheme for the dealer to squeeze more dollars out of a transaction extended warranties for used cars and even some new models can be worthwhile but only when buyers spend time on research to find the warranty with coverage that best fits their vehicle also versions of the civic hybrid have been on the market for years and arent considered exotic or particularly troublesome q the lease on our acura mdx is expiring my wife likes the safety of an suv but id like something with better gas mileage any suggestions clinton stevenson cresskill n j a for a significant increase in fuel economy while keeping the foul weather handling and creature comforts that have made your mdx an enjoyable vehicle your best bet is an all wheel drive luxury sedan like the volvo s audi a or bmw series less expensive models like the ford taurus or chrysler also offer all wheel drive
