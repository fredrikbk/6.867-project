street scenes opera on a brooklyn sidewalk the summer king brooklyn n y saturday operaprojects org summerking brooklyn n y st johns place a quiet street two blocks from eastern parkway on the edge of this boroughs crown heights neighborhood is home to tenements a rarely used synagogue a parking garage and the five myles gallery a converted one story industrial building that in the summer becomes a gathering place for young neighborhood artists including painters poets and a group of teenage hip hop dancers on an august saturday afternoon a few dozen chairs a sound system a keyboard and the makings for a barbecue were set up on the sidewalk outside the gallery in preparation for the eighth annual st johns place on stage a minifestival of local talent coordinated by performance artist hanne tierney owner of the gallery this years anchor event was something a little different a staged reading of two scenes from a new opera "the summer king " by daniel sonenberg produced by american opera projects mr sonenbergs opera is about josh gibson the famous catcher and home run hitter of the negro baseball leagues who was known as the "black babe ruth " gibson who played for the homestead grays and the pittsburgh crawfords died in at the age of just a few months before jackie robinson broke the color bar in major league baseball by joining the brooklyn dodgers the story of "the summer king" is both a celebration and a tragedy celebrating a player who could hit a fair ball out of yankee stadium but also reflecting the pervasive racism of the period the separateness of its black baseball culture and gibsons own precipitous decline and early death the opera certainly has relevance to this african american neighborhood the barber shop of act scene could be the one right around the corner from five myles on franklin avenue albeit in since the operatic barbers lament the fact that the dodgers are about to leave brooklyn and ms tierney notes "all the kids around here know about josh gibson " american opera projects which is developing the opera felt that the baseball theme and the african american hero could make the opera a good vehicle for outreach into communities that dont usually come to the opera house aop held a raffle of baseball merchandise at the performance to collect names and contact information from the audience a second performance was given in fort greene park on aug before a screening of the baseball film "bang the drum slowly" a third also in fort greene park is scheduled for saturday at p m as part of fortgreenefest on st johns place a pair of local djs in do rags worked on the operas sound check as several dozen spectators assembled for the minute performance despite the fierce afternoon heat ms tierney thought that some of the neighborhood people might have been intimidated by the prospect of an opera and stayed away but it was nonetheless a racially mixed group including a singer and a poet who would also be performing in the festival their families and those of the hip hop dancers a few teenage boys some young couples with small children some friends of the composer the occasional passing car slowed down to investigate mr sonenberg hears gibsons story in the musical language of grand opera in act scene the elder barber sung by tenor lynn randolph who remembers gibson in his heyday has a challenging vocal line including a high c he his wife soprano lori kaye miller and the younger barber a jackie robinson fan baritone kenneth overton sing a lyrically nostalgic trio the scenes accompaniment is jazzy and a popular song "did you see jackie robinson hit that ball " comes over the radio for a moment but this is no pop opera scene flashing back for a pantomime re enactment of a big gibson homer in is dominated by the white baseball announcer sung by tenor robert hoyt who adds to the excitement by singing high bs so does his language common in the s but provocative today "they say these darky clubs add enough comedy to the game to give you your moneys worth " the audience was attentive and appreciative the composer a professor at the university of southern maine has been working on the opera his first since and has completed about minutes of the projected two hour score american opera projects the brooklyn based organization dedicated to developing new operas though workshops readings and other activities has been a critical partner for him for example after a staged reading of several scenes in mr sonenberg says "i ended up cutting out all my favorite bits of music i saw it staged and realized that there were places where the singing would finish and there were three bars of music with nothing for the singers to do " he has also learned through the workshop process that his predilection for writing in the extremes of vocal ranges needs to be "paced" a bit working slowly and making changes has been good "so many new operas get commissioned and produced so quickly and they have the kinds of problems that i have had the opportunity to get rid of " he says american opera projects has several works in different development stages including one based on vikram seths verse novel "golden gate " and another on joseph conrads "heart of darkness " in the past decade it has also started doing full fledged productions including the recent holocaust themed "darkling " which was mounted off broadway in and several pieces that have been presented at the lincoln center festival charles jarden aops executive director thinks that it could serve as the "development company" for new work in bigger producing opera companies money is always the issue grants are needed to pay for workshops and opera companies need subsidies to mount new works still he says "its a great time to run an opera company like ours we could fit into lots of holes the opera world has been reinventing itself in the last couple of years they cant do just la bohemes any more " the fate of "the summer king" remains to be seen several more scenes are due to be completed in the next few months and mr sonenberg is hoping that he will have a complete score by next summer aop may put more scenes on its workshop schedule next year in the meantime some new audience members got a tantalizing taste of something different and aop has their names for whenever "the summer king" is ready to go ms
