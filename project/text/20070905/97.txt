picking winners and the losers in the fall lineup questions for lee doyle company wpp groups mediaedge cia title chief executive officer mediaedge cia north america in coming weeks many families will begin their annual armchair exercise critiquing the new fall television line up as the networks roll out their shows starting in september millions of viewers will form opinions about what they will watch through the winter a similar process is under way on madison avenue where media buyers must decide which shows should be supported by their clients deep pocketed marketers during the next months advertisers will spend billions of dollars on the star studded and not so star studded programming to prepare many media buyers have foregone fun in the sun in the past few weeks to analyze the networks new schedules mr doyle talks below about which shows are likely to be successful and which programs will likely to have short life spans the wall street journal what shows are advertisers most buzzed about mr doyle "the big bang theory " a show about two computers geeks and a girl on cbs its sort of a no brainer for advertisers because its in an easy hammock position between "how i met your mother" and "two and a half men" on monday nights monday nights on cbs has become what thursday night on nbc used to be a good solid night of comedy its not a unique concept but its got such a great slot that its probably one of the more likely to succeed geek shows also "the reaper " a show about a kid whose parents sell his soul to the devil it has got a lot of advertiser buzz about half of our advertisers were excited about "big shots " predominantly the female half "big shots" is four guys doing "sex and the city" on abc the girls are excited about it wsj which network has the riskiest fall schedule mr doyle the riskiest schedule has to be nbc they are in a very weak position to begin with and they have the fewest number of new entries and they have done nothing on thursday night which has a very high revenue potential due to things like movie companies it used to be a position of strength for nbc and they have lost that position and they have done nothing to address it wsj which show will be the sleeper hit of the season mr doyle i wouldnt call it a sleeper hit but "cane" starring jimmy smits on cbs is clearly poised for success its got an excellent cast overall it looks like a really good quality drama while its up against some established hits "boston legal" and "law &amp order svu" both of those shows are getting a little tired wsj which program will be the first show canceled mr doyle "viva laughlin" on cbs it is song and dance and its "cop rocks" redone its a tough concept for people to get their heads wrapped around and to find an audience its up against "extreme makeover home edition " football "the simpsons" and "king of the hill " it has got everything going against it wsj given the brouhaha surrounding "kid nation" on cbs are advertisers nervous to buy it mr doyle yes there are probably some advertisers that are going to want to steer clear but if its a runaway hit people will want to take another look at it wsj once again the new fall schedule isnt heavy on sitcoms is this a problem for advertisers mr doyle no its heavy on freaks geeks and nerds at the end of the day advertisers are looking for an audience certainly sitcoms are less likely to be on your hit list of risky programs ultimately we want the networks to deliver an audience whatever programming delivers that audience that is safe for their messages is good with us wsj why do you think the new season is so heavy on geeks and freaks mr doyle one hit begets another everybody always latches onto a concept and spins it out in their own way it looks like they are all looking for the next "heroes" a fairly unexpected hit last year wsj if "cavemen" on abc fails do you think that will hurt the geico brand mr doyle you mean when caveman fails no i dont think it will hurt the geico brand the geico brand has this other campaign with a little lizard so i think they are fine the show is a concept that is funny for maybe a minute or a minute and a half but its not a half hour worth of funny wsj does "gossip girl" have the ability to lift the fortunes of cw mr doyle absolutely "gossip girl" and "the reaper" are two of the more buzz worthy shows out there we anticipate the cw will probably have the biggest ratings growth on a percentage basis because of these shows wsj this summer cable offered up a bevy of critically acclaimed shows such as "mad men " will this rash of top notch programming influence advertisers and make cable more top of mind heading into the new broadcast season mr doyle its been happening for the last few years cable successes have generally been in the broadcast networks off season these days whether you are a broadcast network or a cable network the differential in ratings is so small that all it takes is one or two hits to lift the tide of the entire network the challenge for cable networks is how do they sell the rest of their lineups to advertisers because most cable network brands are defined by one or two shows and they have a few other hours of programming that they have to sell throughout the year wsj will the heavy line up of buzz worthy cable dramas this summer hurt the broadcast network ratings will we see "drama fatigue" mr doyle i think the key is that each drama has to have its own unique hook if you look at the landscape of dramas they are all very different where you run into drama fatigue is when you have shows that are just too similar when you look at the broader spectrum including the cable dramas you have shows that are very different and have unique hooks the bigger issue in the long run is dramas dont play out well in syndication or repeat well like sitcoms do wsj whats your personal favorite mr doyle i am actively rooting for "pushing daisies " i like it it appeals to me it has a lot of interesting elements i think it will be hard for abc to find an audience big enough for it to succeed
