nauticas upscale relaunching turn from moderately priced clothing tacks toward higher end stores when nautica holds its first runway show in three years today the catwalks transparent liquid filled floor wont be the only splashy surprise instead of the plain cotton polo shirts yellow nylon windbreakers and other safe sportswear for which the brand is known the male models will wear luxurious items such as enzyme washed cotton jerseys navy hoodie windbreakers made of light polyester with a silver coating and white sanded cotton canvas pants parent vf corp the nations largest apparel maker with annual sales of &# billion is trying to transform nautica from a moderately priced mens brand sold primarily at macys to supplement that more affordable line nautica is adding a more upscale "halo" collection that might one day be carried by a boutique or higher end department store such as nordstrom or saks fifth avenue the push is part of vfs broader strategy to focus on brands with growth potential amid shrinking demand for middle market labels department store consolidation and a move by these stores to promote their own private label merchandise much of which looks similar to the middle market labels clothing sales of upscale and high end brands are growing at a faster clip than moderately priced brands and they tend to be sold in venues that dont discount as heavily or often as middle market department stores which also increases profitability last year nautica introduced a womens line as part of its attempt to expand nauticas repositioning is being steered by the labels new creative director mirian lamberth a former creative director at tommy hilfiger she was hired this year to fill a position that had been vacant since when nautica founder david chu left over differences with vf of greensboro n c about what direction the brand should take as well as adding more luxurious fabrics and pricing the "halo" collection by an average of to higher ms lamberth is bringing back some of the brands signature touches such as speckled draw cords reinforced navy nautica labels on the back of outerwear and sail inspired zig zag stitching "the brand got a little too interested in trend and fashion " and it missed the boat when it came to the trend toward more upscale touches and fabrics says ms lamberth an apparel industry veteran who has helped a variety of brands including tommy hilfiger and oshkosh return to their roots the nautica runway show which kicks off new york fashion week is intended to generate buzz among the fashion set and get well to do shoppers to take another look at the year old brand the aim is to give nautica a luxury halo that "will set the tone for the brand and give it an aspirational aspect " says denise seegal president of the vf division that oversees nautica but it isnt a sure bet current fans of the label may balk at the higher prices and nautica may have a tough time persuading new customers to pay as much as &# for a navy cashmere pea coat from a brand they associate with the middle market consumers response "will depend on how well they can execute some really fine quality fashion and style product " says madison riley a principal at retail consultant kurt salmon associates adding that nautica may have a challenge in persuading consumers that it is doing something different and getting consumers to try the new collection sticking only with the middle market isnt an option for nautica sales at macys nauticas largest customer have been slumping and overall sales at midtier retailers fell in the months ended july according to customer growth partners a retail consulting firm sales at luxury retailers by contrast increased and sales at discounters jumped part of nauticas strategy now involves opening more full priced stores in the u s and abroad there are more than stores now world wide and updating their look to make customers feel like they are on a yacht the newer stores which carry both mens clothes and a year old womens line have maple and cherry floors curved surfaces porthole windows and nautical motifs nautica stores previously had a minimalist look with stark white walls and marble floors as with liz claiborne inc and other makers of midtier apparel vf also is revamping its brands to focus on those with higher growth potential in january it sold its vanity fair intimate apparel business for which the company was named to berkshire hathaway inc s fruit of the loom for &# million in august vf acquired premium jeans brand seven for all mankind for &# million to help start a contemporary clothing group vf is also putting more emphasis on its sportswear group which includes nautica the john varvatos brand and accessories label kipling together these labels accounted for of vfs sales in nautica is the groups biggest brand but its growth has lagged behind varvatos and kipling when mr chu started nautica in it focused on casual sailing themed clothes such as swim trunks fisherman sweaters and yellow slickers it eventually expanded to include preppy meets outdoorsman shirts pants and outerwear the lines signature motifs included sailboat logos and orange rubber "floaties " or key rings which ms lamberth the new creative director also is bringing back on some items such as polo shirts nautica grew robustly in the s but lost its luster in recent years partly because of rough conditions at department stores its fashions also veered off course getting increasingly contemporary and less traditional by the time vf bought nautica for &# million in it had weathered four consecutive years of declining profits mr chu who became the brands chief executive and vf had plans then to reposition the brand to go more upscale and traditional but mr chu ended up leaving a year later "once you are acquired by a company like vf it may have plans that you may not agree with you say its ok were different we can part ways " says mr chu who now designs high end tailored clothing for men and is creative director for luggage maker tumi among the first things ms lamberth says she did after her arrival was to get her staff to concentrate on nauticas identity and come up with a "creative vision" statement among the messages "we draw our strength from the sea " and "classic yet modern and always focused on whats next " together the group also selected five words to keep in mind when designing clothes for the label crisp clean nautical bold and refined "this is what we stand for and our clothes have to have these things in common " ms lamberth says still on her wish list sailing lessons for all nautica employees "im dreaming of having everyone in the company learn how to sail " she says adding that she has proposed the idea to higher ups "its important from an authentic design point of view " vfs ms seegal says nautica will offer sailing lessons to its creative crew this year corrections &amp amplifications vf corp s sportswear division
