mobile firms dial into homes faced with stiffer competition and the emergence of rival internet telephony and wifi technologies mobile phone operators are looking for ways to cash in on the time consumers spend using their phones inside the home in europe to of mobile phone calls are made from within the home and in the u s this figure is as high as according to london based research firm ovum yet with poor reception limiting cellular usage inside many buildings mobile operators are losing out to emerging internet technologies such as ebay inc s skype and wifi services launched by national landline incumbents having spent billions on third generation or g telephone licenses so that they can offer consumers lucrative high speed mobile internet services such as television and music downloads mobile phone operators now plan to claw back their share of residential phone usage by putting tiny box shaped base stations the size of a paperback novel into customers homes european network operators such as vodafone group plc telefonica sas o france telecoms orange and japans softbank corp are currently testing femtocell technology tiny indoor versions of the large phone towers that link up national mobile networks via a users broadband internet connection femtocell derives its name from being a unit far smaller in size than an outdoor phone tower commercial roll outs are planned for mid but operators hoping to deploy this femtocell technology must overcome challenges including its costliness and the impact it will have on existing network coverage "more and more calls are made from inside of buildings in fact quite a large percentage are now " said dave williams chief technology officer at telefonica o europe the u k s largest mobile phone operator by subscribers which is internally testing the technology in the u k and in homes in madrid "people are comfortable with their mobile devices but today in some homes theres not the coverage that there should be " said mr williams instead of developing more outdoor radio towers to try and improve indoor phone coverage which especially with g radio frequencies struggles to travel through walls and into buildings operators will be able to start building telecom networks from the inside out rather than traveling from the nearest radio mast femtocells allow the operator to send voice calls and data directly into the customers home over the internet using a broadband connection calls and information are then transmitted through the air from the femtocell box to the mobile phone however when the person leaves the house calls will roam back onto the larger outside macrocell network most operators currently use macrocell networks made up of large outdoor phone masts and base stations to provide customers with mobile services however these sometimes struggle to reach all customers in built up urban areas as radio waves can weaken when traveling through building materials according to new york based analyst group abi research some million femtocells will be installed in homes around the world serving million users by in a recent presentation to investors arun sarin chief executive of vodafone the worlds largest mobile operator by revenue also said the company was encouraging manufacturers to develop femtocell technology despite not yet committing to the technology because of current manufacturing costs and remaining technical glitches he said he expects femtocells to become commercially deployed by the middle of mr sarin added that the deployment of femtocells could fit with the companys "mobile plus" strategy which is focused on earning the company an additional of group revenue or about gbp billion about &# billion from new services including broadband mobile advertising and fixed to mobile convergence by while operators such as orange and bt group plc are currently using other technologies such as wifi and unlicensed mobile access to launch hybrid wireless phone services that offer customers the cheapest tariff depending on whether they are at home or outdoors femtocells can also reduce the cost of running an operators larger macrocell networks according to research firm ovum there are only a small number of phones that work off wifi and uma networks whereas femtocells work with consumers existing devices says ovum analyst vincent poulbere femtocells could offload a considerable amount of voice and data traffic from the national outdoor macrocell networks this may lead to cash savings by lowering capacity needs on the outdoor network and by reducing site rental power supply and mobile traffic costs mr poulbere said understandably because of the growing interest among operators private equity investors such as paris based rothschild gestion and londons advent venture partners llp alongside technology giants google inc and intel corp are funding some of the prominent femtocell start ups such as u k firms ip access ltd and ubiquisys ltd larger telecommunications infrastructure firms such as motorola inc telefon ab l m ericsson huawei technologies co and nokia siemens networks the telecom infrastructure joint venture between nokia corp and siemens ag are also developing the technology and could well snap up the smaller pioneers says jean michel beghin private equity partner at rothschild fund r capital technologies which has invested in ip access "its a fact that we are seeing fixed to mobile substitution among users but at the same time other technologies are challenging in the home if mobile operators can reduce the pricing difference between wireline and mobile then people will start switching to this very quickly " he said however femtocells still have several hurdles to overcome with femtocell boxes currently costing about &# to &# compared to the average dsl router of &# one stumbling block is price consumers could be loath to pay for yet another expensive box which potentially offers more value to the operator rather than the customer meanwhile with call prices dropping operators are reluctant to invest in such an expensive kit "we are obviously looking for a mass market price on this which would be substantially less than &# " said vodafones mr sarin but os mr williams believes that prices are set to drop as commercial roll outs gain momentum he adds that by bundling the femtocell into other devices such as wifi and broadband routers as well as digital television set top boxes prices can be mitigated in spain and the czech republic femtocells could be added to os internet tv devices he says where as in the u k or germany it could fit into a dsl router one manufacturer ubiquisys ltd has already signed a deal with mass market router maker netgear inc to bundle femtocells dsl wifi and internet telephony into one box while rival firm ip access is working with thomson to build femtocells into tv set top boxes by bundling multimedia services such as tv music and internet access operators could reduce customer turnover and attract new subscribers says ovums mr poulbere however several infrastructure challenges remain operators need to balance security of their radio network while ensuring that home gateways are simple for customers to set up and configure also operators will need to ensure that there isnt interference between neighboring femtocells and outdoor macrocell networks mr poulbere says but os mr williams believes these technical issues can be ironed out and are already being addressed in current tests o and its chinese technology partner huawei have been working to overcome interference and test consumer usage patterns "theres a couple of things that will happen in the next few years there will be a lot more broadband penetration than we have today and wifi frequencies will become very noisy and congested this makes femtocells attractive " he said "its a very very interesting space and i think it will become quite big "
