personal measure scholars link success of firms to lives of ceos a family death hurts studies say as does buying a mansion should shareholders in a company care if the chief executives child dies what if the mother in law passes away such things dont normally figure in investment decisions but maybe they should according to a recent study by three finance professors mining a trove of danish government data on thousands of businesses they were able to track links between ceo family deaths and the companies profitability over a decade it slid by about one fifth on average in the two years after the death of a ceos child and by about after the death of a spouse as for an executives mother in law the old jokes seem to hold the researchers found that profitability on average rose slightly after her demise the study is part of an emerging and controversial area of financial research that delves into the lives and personalities of executives in search of links to stock prices and corporate performance the trend is an outgrowth of the tendency to lionize ceos as critical to the businesses they lead if their performance is so vital the researchers say investors should want to know anything that could affect it "when you go to the track you study the horse " says david yermack a new york university finance professor "investing is not that different you want to know as much as you can about the jockey " a study he co wrote looked at executives home purchases it found that on average the stocks of companies run by leaders who buy or build megamansions sharply underperform the market the researchers dont claim to know why they theorize that some of these executives might be focused more on enjoying their wealth and less on working hard one ceo looked at was trevor fetter of tenet healthcare corp who bought a square foot manse in the dallas area around the start of since then tenets stock is off more than while the broader market has risen a spokesman for the hospital chain said it was aware of the study but had no comment other academics have found underperformance in both profits and stock prices at companies led by executives who received awards such as best manager kudos from the business press the theory once they become stars some ceos may pay more attention to writing memoirs and sitting on outside boards and a little less to running their companies two penn state professors recently attempted to rate ceos of technology companies on their degree of narcissism they looked at things like the size of executives photos in annual reports and how often they use the first person singular in press interviews the authors concluded that narcissistic executives tended to take greater risks leading to bigger swings in profitability of their companies the study called "its all about me " is to be published in administrative science quarterly the new line of research raises thorny privacy questions if it intensifies could ceos lives be plumbed like those of politicians and movie stars researchers say an area ripe for study is the possible effect of divorce and "trophy wives" on business success "i find it hard to imagine if i had a sick child that would be anybodys business " says jerry w levin chairman of sharper image corp and former ceo of revlon inc "to assume that because something is going on in my personal life its going to affect my business its crazy i wouldnt even ask those kinds of questions about my own employees my own executives " on the other hand executives might be cheered to know the studies generally conclude ceos do matter to their companies performance that might bolster their side in the great debate over the magnitude of executive pay some investors say theyd welcome personal data about ceos if it werent too intrusive "prying into people who have a kid with leukemia thats a bit of an invasion " says scott black president of delphi management inc a boston money manager but mr black says he shies away from companies that spend lavishly on headquarters and furnishings and if he found out a ceo had bought a mansion or yacht or a &# million painting he says that "would be of interest" to him the new research is part of a more nuanced approach to studying management instead of assuming all ceos are devoted to maximizing wealth for themselves or shareholders researchers posit that executives can have other aims like building a legacy or showing off wealth through a mammoth house these may be perfectly rational behaviors but hardly ones that are in shareholders interest the internet of course has made research into homes marriages and deaths far easier thanks to commercial and government databases this no longer means haunting dusty courthouse record rooms prof yermack and crocker liu of arizona state university set out to find real estate records on the ceos who were running all of the s&amp p companies at the end of they scoured electronic records of taxes and deed transfers when they couldnt find a home address they turned to databases on voter registration rolls and campaign contributions eventually they found the addresses of of the executives the median size of their principal homes was a little over square feet some were far bigger a key finding was that stock performance tended to deteriorate after a ceo bought or built an extremely large or costly estate which they defined as over square feet or sited on more than acres on average these companies stocks underperformed the s&amp p index by about percentage points over the three years after the purchase the researchers used aerial photos available on the internet to find swimming pools tennis courts boathouses and other amenities one such photo of the home of limited brands inc ceo leslie wexner clearly showed an equestrian ring mr wexner started buying the first part of the plus acre estate near columbus ohio in the researchers say limited stock fell slightly in the following three years while the s&amp p index rose about the estate now includes a square foot house according to county records a spokeswoman for limited said the company and mr wexner wouldnt comment government records show stephen bollenbach chief executive of hilton hotels corp bought a square foot house in the bel air section of los angeles in january over the following three years the s&amp p went up more than but hiltons stock fell about the hotel company later rebounded and recently agreed to be taken private by blackstone group a hilton spokeswoman declined to comment the declines were averages some executives who bought mansions saw their stocks rise afterward the researchers dont claim a direct causal link between a home purchase and a companys stock "its whatever is driving the ceo to want to live in a mansion which to a certain extent is very hard to observe " says prof yermack the purchase might signal that the executive is entrenched in his position he says or may prefer leisure to work another speculation in a few cases costly real estate purchases might provide cover that enables ceos who are dubious about their companies prospects to sell a lot of stock without arousing suspicion to frederick e "shad" rowe jr a money manager and head of an activist investor group called the investors for director accountability foundation the real estate study "makes perfect sense " a ceo buys a huge house "then he needs to hire a decorator then a landscape architect " mr rowe says "you spend a lot of time and energy that you could be spending running the company " prof yermack says he has received numerous requests from investors for copies of the paper titled "where are the shareholders mansions " he and prof liu say it would be easy to build a simple trading strategy to profit from the edifice complex one could track ceos house purchases through public records bet against the stocks of companies whose chiefs bought or built megamansions and buy the stocks of firms whose executives have more modest housing tastes the professors calculated that doing that would have outperformed the market by about percentage points a year in contrast to real estate studying the effects of family deaths on performance might seem unusually intrusive three professors who did so were trying to figure out how much chief executives matter to their companies performance versus the many other factors "the idea of this was to find a random event that hits a ceo and evaluate the performance of the firm before and after this shock " says co author daniel wolfenzon an associate finance professor at new york universitys stern school of business "you have exactly the same ceo and the same firm the only difference is that there is a shock " denmarks government collects large amounts of personal information on citizens from job status to death records it also requires every company even private ones to make some financial data public after years of lobbying the researchers gained access to danish data and identified ceos who had faced a death in the family they wondered if grief or distraction might have affected companies subsequent profitability the greatest change followed a death of a ceos child on average profitability as measured by operating return on assets was roughly lower in the two years after such an event than in the two years before it the drop was sharper when the child was under and greater still if it was the death of an only child gerald m levin was chief executive of time warner inc in when his grown son was murdered "of course i went into a tailspin " he said "i made i wont call it a mistake i returned to what for me was a narcotic i returned to work i worked hours a day " he said he couldnt judge whether his performance was affected but notes that he felt drained of emotion as though "nothing that happened could affect me anymore " mr levins grief didnt correlate with a drop in time warners stock price which greatly outperformed the broader market during the three years after his sons murder asked about the study by prof wolfenzon who did it with morten bennedsen of copenhagen business school and francisco perez gonzalez of the university of texas mr levin said it "sounds sensible " but "im still skeptical because there are so many other factors " mr levin said there is immense pressure on executives to hide personal problems a situation he feels should change he now helps run a holistic wellness center in california focusing on helping people recover from traumas and other upheavals although he isnt sure that grief would distract a top executive from his work he said "not enough attention is being paid to the personal situation of a ceo these are individuals its important to understand theyre not automatons " in the study a ceos parents death also was followed by a decline in the companys return on assets though a smaller drop than after the death of a spouse or child overall the profitability drops were sharper at companies headed by female ceos the researchers say theyre not clear why only a mother in laws death was correlated with an upturn and it was too small to be statistically significant prof wolfenzon says they included the mother in law as a rationality check "its a little bit funny that the mother in law dying doesnt distract the ceo " he said hastening to add that his own mother in law is vitally important to his productivity "as we speak shes taking care of my kids " it isnt clear how applicable the study is to big public companies in the u s or elsewhere the authors acknowledge most of those studied were small family controlled ones where a shock to the ceo might have more impact though prof wolfenzon said the effects appeared similar across all sizes of danish companies could investors take advantage of the studys conclusions by watching death registries or even spying on hospital admissions prof wolfenzon says such information is much tougher to find in most countries than in denmark but he muses "because the data is so difficult to get it may not be factored into prices that makes it a more attractive investment strategy "
