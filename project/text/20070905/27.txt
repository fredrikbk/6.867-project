mr lane an executive vice president at citigroup inc is overseeing an ambitious program by the banking giant to green up its vast real estate portfolio which totals million square feet world wide to achieve that the year old whom colleagues sometimes call "the al gore of citigroup" has taken an inventory of energy use of all of the companys buildings adopted power saving measures such as turning off escalators in lobbies and is redesigning its bank branches to include more natural lighting and recycled materials "i wish i had al gore to do this but it was me they got stuck with " mr lane joked in a june talk before fellow corporate real estate executives at the sustainable operations summit outside albuquerque n m which had green buildings as a main theme mr lanes program is just one of many green building initiatives now popping up in office buildings google inc in june installed a solar rooftop at its mountain view calif headquarters at million megawatts enough power to light

green design as part of its rental leases such initiatives could have broad repercussions power use by all buildings world wide accounts for nearly a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions making it one of the largest sources of global warming according to many scientists estimates not only do companies help the environment by cutting emissions they save money by lowering their operating costs mr lane says citigroup can save as much as &# per square foot a year by making its offices use less energy that would add up to savings of almost &# million annually the new york financial behemoth last year launched a &# billion plan to reduce the carbon footprint from its facilities below its level by some companies are finding that greener buildings are also safer ones california health care giant kaiser permanente which has embarked on a green building plan at new and existing hospitals says replacing marble floors in its hospital lobbies with recycled rubber ones reduced the incidence of

conversation and saying we have to do something now " says andrew winston an environmental consultant in riverside conn citigroup started its green efforts in in part after mounting public concern over global warming mr lane a year citigroup veteran who once worked as a naval public works officer was tasked with documenting the companys energy consumption so in he helped commission an inventory of the energy use of every piece of real estate that citigroup owned or leased from bank branches to atm machines "what you cant measure you cant manage " he says getting the data proved challenging given language differences around the world in rio de janeiro for instance local citigroup managers put down a surprisingly low figure for the amount of energy they calculated the company was using for chilled water to cool its buildings it turned out the managers thought "chilled water" referred to office water coolers mr lane says the inventory showed energy use by building which mr lane says was helpful in identifying which ones needed the most attention the study found that of the energy consumption in citis offices was coming out of about of its buildings the places using the most energy were generally citis larger facilities such as data centers office buildings and skyscrapers mr lane who is based in chicago then traveled to citigroup locations around the world asking its employees to do their part in saving energy such as switching off unneeded lights after citigroup in announced its reduction plan mr lane and his team decided to try some quick fixes like changing the setting on thermostats at a citigroup operations center in steamy tampa fla last november they dialed the thermostat up to degrees from his staff turned the thermostat back down after complaints from many of the centers workers "you know from the number of calls whether youve gone too far " mr lane says adding that hes learned to increase temperatures more gradually "maybe a degree a day " he says escalators have also been turned off during certain hours in the lobbies of some citigroup towers in new york employees who are able are asked to take the stairs in some older citigroup buildings meanwhile workers have been told they can open windows to let in fresh air and at some u s offices building managers are testing a new urinal design that doesnt use water the company may also get tough with landlords since citigroup leases about three quarters of its world wide space at a minimum mr lane says citigroup would ask for the energy ratings of offices in buildings where it leases which are used to compare how efficiently buildings use power down the road he says the company would like to require green certifications in offices it leases meanwhile the company is making its own buildings green using solar heat and glare controls timed lighting and other power cutting measures citigroups new four building corporate campus in suburban dallas opened last year and has been awarded the leed certification citigroup is also nearing the end of constructing a story building in queens n y which will include enough energy saving features to meet the leed standards say bank officials some of the eco features include a storm water recycling system energy efficient fixtures and work areas designed so that most employees can receive outdoor lighting and the company is also redesigning its new citibank citifinancial and smith barney branches globally with green features such as more natural lighting and recycled materials about such branches in the u s have been opened so far to the delight of some workers who say they can see outside for the first time "people are much more like plants and cats than we like to admit " says shannon barnes manager of a new citibank branch in chicagos old town district besides office buildings citigroup is greening up its other facilities including a data center in frankfurt germany that is set to feature "living" walls covered with plants so as to better insulate the building from summer heat and winter cold the efforts are winning cautious praise from some environmentalists but many say the actions arent enough a group of protesters in late july demonstrated outside a citibank branch in downtown san francisco accusing the citigroup unit of continuing to make loans to coal fired power plants that are leading sources of carbon emissions "all the operational changes in the world arent going to make up for the carbon from the plants they are funding " says rebecca tarbotton who helped organize the protest by the rainforest action network citigroup officials say that because the u s still relies on half its energy needs from coal the country cant just move to new sources of fuel overnight "we need to work on how to get from here to there " says pamela flaherty a citigroup senior vice president corrections &amp amplifications google inc installed a megawatt solar rooftop at its mountain view calif
