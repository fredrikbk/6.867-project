exelon holders focus on comed new york exelon corp investors are heaving a sigh of relief as the companys commonwealth edison co utility nears a resolution to months long political turmoil in illinois that threatened to bankrupt the subsidiary but their complacency could be short lived as analysts call on the company to sell comed permanently eliminating the utilitys drag on exelons earnings growth comed and other illinois power companies reached a &# billion electric rate agreement with lawmakers in july providing rebates and other assistance to customers hit by a rate shock under the terms of the settlement which was approved last week by illinois gov rod blagojevich legislators agreed to abandon a three year rate freeze proposal that would have steered comed toward insolvency illinois consumers and legislators had called for a renewed rate freeze and power generation tax after a year freeze ended on jan as part of the states utility deregulation process the deregulation caused rate hikes of up to for comed customers now that the rate controversy in illinois appears to be coming to a close analysts are urging exelon to divest itself of comed a sale would benefit investors because comeds earnings have trailed income from the rest of the company particularly its nonregulated power generation business which has seen significant earnings growth amid rising power prices and soaring electricity demand analysts said the debate over whether a power company should sell or spin off its regulated utility isnt unique to exelon regulated utilities and nonregulated power generation businesses that are owned by the same company have come under intense scrutiny from state lawmakers amid rising rates some legislators charge that generators sell power to affiliated utilities at unreasonably high prices leading to steep electric rate increases for consumers analysts and shareholders have urged baltimores constellation energy group inc to divest itself of its baltimore gas &amp electric co utility maryland gov martin omalley raised the prospect of a split in july when he asked state regulators to investigate whether bges relationship with constellation contributed to the rate increase approved in june for the utilitys customers "the power companies that operate in a market based environment are going to be facing the same questions that exelon seems to be facing now " said samuel brothwell managing director of power and gas equity research at wachovia capital markets in new york unloading comed could help exelon sidestep concerns about whether its relationship with the utility resulted in unnecessarily high electric prices for illinois consumers as part of the settlement agreement with lawmakers comed and other illinois utilities will buy power from a public agency replacing an auction process that some legislators had said was unfair because generators such as exelon sold power at artificially high prices to affiliated utilities but chicago based exelon has so far resisted calls to sell comed exelon has generated &# million in cost savings by keeping its utilities which include comed and pennsylvania utility peco energy co and the non regulated power generation business as part of the same company chief executive john rowe said during the companys second quarter earnings call "they are not dollars to throw away lightly " mr rowe said regulated electric utilities typically earn lower returns than non regulated power generators do because regulators limit the prices utilities can charge to consumers in some cases rate freezes and associated political disputes have made it more difficult for utilities to turn a profit in states such as illinois where deregulation has led to higher earnings for nonregulated power generators analysts see little justification for keeping merchant power generation and regulated electric distribution as part of the same company comed reported net income of &# million for the second quarter a decrease over the &# million recorded for the second quarter of the utility which serves customers in chicago and surrounding areas attributed the loss to the end of revenue it had been guaranteed while illinois was still making the transition to a deregulated power market in contrast exelon generation which includes the companys nonregulated power generation business power marketing and trading and competitive retail sales posted net income of &# million in the second quarter a increase over &# million for the second quarter of exelons mr rowe has argued that there is no need to separate comed from exelon generation now that an electric rate settlement has been reached in illinois the replacement of the power auction with a public power agency should assuage legislators fears about the power generation units association with comed mr rowe said during exelons second quarter earnings call "we believe that these issues of where is the value change from year to year and there has to be a pretty overwhelming case before you take something apart that has this fit " he said
