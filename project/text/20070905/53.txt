how to keep our cities up and running joel kotkins aug editorial page commentary "road work" sends another wakeup call to governors and mayors well maintained infrastructure in urban areas is a great public benefit yet officials historically cut road and bridge maintenance to support new ribbon cutting stadiums construction of the type mr kotkin discusses potholes and tottering bridges become ubiquitous powerful political and financial incentives are at work todays new convention center generates great tv coverage for politicians on opening day and it costs taxpayers only five cents for every dollar spent the other cents plus interest is transferred to future taxpayers via long term bonds yet if a bridge is fully maintained say by regular scraping and painting tv crews do not show up and the taxpayer is immediately hit for the full dollar glowing media reports not high taxes elect public officials once i asked a member of congress to lead the way to require mayors and governors to implement a program of "scheduled maintenance" for every project congress funds not surprisingly the idea was rejected ned regan professor baruch college former new york city comptroller new york joel kotkin as usual seems to start with a thesis and then ignore evidence that would tend to disprove it or he dances around the evidence to suit his needs he comes down hard on municipalities in places that he doesnt like very much new york minneapolis cleveland which is anyplace that doesnt fit with his vision of "utopia" charlotte phoenix houston the costs of maintaining infrastructure have ballooned due to the sprawl that mr kotkin embraces even in the more compact cities that he loathes due to the high price of maintaining a massive commuter infrastructure for single car commuters to condemn the minneapolis light rail as a failure due to "only" boardings on a system that is not yet finished is disingenuous as well the sort of infrastructure investments that need to be made to reduce wear on roads and stop spending exorbitant sums to expand highway networks that will be at peak capacity as soon as they are put into service are derided by mr kotkin for their "minuscule" ridership even though they are not complete systems cities that you would not think are light rail candidates salt lake city denver dallas are expanding their light rail networks in order to grow more sensibly and deal with the demand that has grown from riders in the past few years the ridership numbers are there the compact and sensible development around the rail is there the demand for greater service is there the only thing missing is mr kotkins grudging acknowledgement that this is a positive investment in infrastructure that is more than a "feel good but often low performing" project joseph e bornstein aicp chicago
