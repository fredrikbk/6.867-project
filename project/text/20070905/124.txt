the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources culture are relics best preserved when scattered the near loss of some of greeces most precious ancient monuments to raging fires shows the advantages of dispersing cultural treasures throughout the world says mary beard classics editor of britains times literary supplement had the fires destroyed artifacts in olympia birthplace of the olympic games some sculptures that once adorned the compounds temple of zeus would have survived because they are safely housed in the louvre in paris ms beard emphasizes that she isnt criticizing greeces handling of its historical treasures and doesnt advocate shipping greek relics abroad wholesale but insisting that all works of art stay in the geographical area in which they are made makes for poor cultural planning in a globalized world ms beard writes on her blog ms beards initial comment on the issue drew angry reactions from readers she was accused of being insensitive to greeces cultural heritage all the more so because the fires were still burning whats more concerns over the preservation of historical artifacts come as greece italy and other countries are pressuring u s cultural institutions to repatriate artifacts those governments consider to be looted treasures but ms beard says her concerns are entirely practical and that they apply to her own countrys heritage as well it would make sense she says if some of the english crown jewels were sent abroad she praises the reconstructed country house rooms from her native britain in new york citys metropolitan museum of art "i like the idea that visitors who come in from the extraordinarily different world of fifth avenue should find themselves reminded of my culture " ms beard concedes that attempts to preserve the worlds treasures have been mixed with the desire of rich countries to grab wealth from poorer nations and some monuments are so tied to their location that it doesnt make sense to move them but in principle sharing remains a practical way to keep the worlds cultural heritage safe despite the aesthetic and political discomfort it might cause times literary supplement sept india middle class skepticism impedes political change indias middle class has been a dynamic presence in the business world but its lack of interest in the political sphere bodes poorly for the countrys future says a scholar of south asian politics and culture much of the indian middle class doesnt think political change is necessary or possible says chakravarthi ram prasad a professor of comparative religion and philosophy at britains lancaster university indias middle class which he defines as the million or so people who have a telephone a motorized vehicle and a color television focuses mainly on improving its childrens earnings the middle class supports government spending on higher education to gain an edge in the knowledge economy but not on primary education that would help its poorest citizens prof ram prasad cites as typical the views of some indian information technology professionals in a recent focus group he conducted they dismissed political activity as dishonest they thought the most effective way to make a difference was to donate money to their companies charities in general the middle class holds political parties in equally low esteem without greater pressure from the middle class to reform the countrys political and social structures it is hard to see how indias hundreds of millions of poor will see their lives improve markedly "middle class skepticism about the capacity of the state is understandable but is also at the root of indias troubles " dr ram prasad writes in britains prospect magazine he notes that the most politically active indians tend to be poor though not destitute it is possible that real reform in areas like prejudice against lower castes will only come from political coalitions that manage to lump together the votes of more marginalized populations prospect magazine september medicine altering appointment policy might save everyone time doctors need to take a cue from the restaurant business and allow
