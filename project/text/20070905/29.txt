common sense economic need should steer rate cut smartmoney now that summer vacation is officially over lets hope that calmer heads prevail on wall street and in washington lets start with all the clamoring for a cut in the benchmark federal funds rate by the federal reserve whos doing all this clamoring chief executives of mortgage lenders naturally and no doubt many hedge fund managers and private equity investors would love to return to the cheap money and easy leverage theyve enjoyed for the past six years an era that ended abruptly a few weeks ago but whats so great about a rate cut for all the rest of us in much anticipated comments last week fed chairman ben bernanke reassured the public that hes mindful of the recent credit turmoil and market volatility and of their potential to undermine the health of the broad economy while widely interpreted as making a rate cut all but certain mr bernanke made clear hell act only if the economy needs a fiscal stimulus and not because wall street wants to be bailed out of a mess it largely created that means the fed will cut its key lending rate if the economy which was doing fine in the quarter ended june has since been significantly damaged why is this a development we should celebrate obviously if the broad economy has been harmed the fed should cut rather than do nothing but the fed has access to lots of raw data both unavailable and unintelligible to the rest of us if the fed concludes that a rate cut isnt necessary or appropriate because the economy remains fundamentally healthy id call that good news in recent weeks stock investors have been taking the opposite tack on a day when they despaired a rate cut wouldnt happen the dow jones industrial average dropped almost points the next day when reminded that the fed was prepared to act if necessary and hopes of a rate cut again flourished the average gained nearly all of it back i believe this knee jerk hope for a rate cut is more a result of conditioning than reasoning during alan greenspans tenure at the fed financial crises were followed by rate cuts the economy advanced as did stock market averages in the minds of most investors it seems to be gospel that a rate cut means future market gains no doubt this has usually been true historically but is the converse also true does the failure to cut rates mean that the economy will suffer and stock markets are destined to fall the problem is that we dont know we dont know what would have happened in those earlier crisis years had the greenspan fed stayed the course perhaps mr greenspan had the economic data indicating damage to the broad economy that amply justified the cuts but at least some economists have argued that wed have been better off had mr greenspan been more cautious and that rate cuts only encouraged the high risk even reckless decision making that has brought us to our current predicament i dont think theres any need to resolve that issue or to criticize mr greenspan in order to recognize that some rate cuts if not justified by economic conditions are likely to do more harm than good at this juncture im willing to give mr bernanke the benefit of the doubt that hell do the right thing if the fed cuts its key rate so be it but it will make me nervous about the health of the economy and the still widening effects of the subprime mortgage crisis if he decides a rate cut is unnecessary then so much the better if the economy is fundamentally healthy id view any market selloff as a buying opportunity james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
