business countrywide finds no spot isnt easy how could countrywide financial veer so badly off course for years the calabasas calif mortgage lender was considered the shrewdest toughest player in the industry with its no market share as proof yet in the past days the intensifying u s housing slump and related credit scares have sent countrywides stock tumbling and forced the company to scramble for liquidity such calamities arent supposed to befall market leaders yes they may falter a bit in tough times but conventional wisdom regards the biggest company in any industry be it intel corp procter &amp gamble co or anheuser busch cos as practically indestructible such companies have the most customers the largest sales forces and the broadest grasp of their industrys nuances they are supposed to be like champion squash players holding center court and forcing weaker rivals to scurry in the corners jack welch the former chief executive officer of general electric co built his career on establishing ges operating units as the no or no player in their industries if that proved impossible he closed or divested those businesses he saw market leadership as a reliable path to above average profitability and growth in most cases he was right but as countrywides affair shows market leadership is becoming far more perilous than outsiders might think new rivals keep trying to unseat the champ strategies that once fueled breakneck growth may backfire in hard times and in some cases market leaders focus so intently on what they know best production and sales that they get guillotined by unexpected changes in other arenas such as regulation or finance patrick viguerie a mckinsey &amp co consultant has developed what he calls the topple rate a measure of how many market leading companies lose that status during the next five years in the early s he says it was about by the period it had climbed to rigorous data for the past few years arent yet in but mr viguerie believes the rate has held steady or perhaps even climbed a case study developed at the massachusetts institute of technologys sloan school of management analyzes callaway golf co s missteps in the late s after its big bertha drivers helped it become the leading golf club maker callaway kept expanding but demand waned as asian economies weakened and u s golfers balked at constantly buying fancier callaway offerings inventory built up profit skidded and a management shake up ensued callaway is a valuable example because it makes clear to students that managements on a winning streak can misread market conditions explains rebecca henderson a sloan professor "people assume that more market share is automatically good " she says "its not sometimes firms focus so hard on building share that they build way beyond the true market for their products " another classic danger involves companies that grow rapidly by acquisition but fail to put the pieces together effectively in the early s a takeover spree briefly turned saatchi &amp saatchi into the worlds largest advertising agency but the firm couldnt run its sprawling empire effectively the founders were forced out and saatchi &amp saatchi was sold several times it currently ranks no in revenue among u s ad agencies countrywides fate is still unfolding so its too early to attempt a definitive analysis of its problems but its aggressive lending strategy of the past few years appears to have relied on a belief that rising real estate values would keep turning risky mortgages into strong and highly profitable assets that worked beautifully for a while then home prices headed south and countrywide couldnt tidy up its portfolio fast enough to calm investors anxieties that it was overextended now countrywide hopes that a &# billion equity infusion from bank of america will restore investors faith in its operations and let it grow again maybe maybe not despite its vast size countrywide still is at the mercy of investors sentiment which fluctuates daily the company declined to comment a fascinating perspective comes from richard h scott who built columbia hca healthcare into the largest hospital company in the mid s it was a short lived triumph for him mr scott stepped aside as ceo in after the companys standing was hurt by a wide ranging federal probe into fraud allegations the company now known as hca was taken private last year "its easy to get blindsided when youre growing fast " mr scott says "you have to build better legal and internal audit capabilities you need to be able to deal with regulatory issues but we were growing so fast we often hired people six months after we needed them " slowing down and shoring up a company against unexpected threats can be anathema to the hard charging culture that defines many young market leaders mr scott suggests its easier to hire like minded go getters who embrace top managements vision but that can make it hard for bosses to adapt fast enough when things change mr scott now is chairman of solantic llc a five year old company that owns urgent care centers in florida and he is putting his hard learned lessons to use he is expanding more slowly this time he has hired more seasoned executives with diverse experience he also has recruited outside investors to the closely held company inviting them to take fresh looks at how solantic is doing "we needed that extra accountability " he says
