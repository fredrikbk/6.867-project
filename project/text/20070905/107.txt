politics &amp economics old rival clouds musharraf bhutto grand bargain exiled sharif plans return to pakistan on wave of support pakistans president pervez musharraf and former prime minister benazir bhutto edged closer to a deal designed to secure each of them a future in pakistani politics people on both sides of the negotiations say but their delicate plans for a power sharing arrangement could yet be upended by another former prime minister who is expected to arrive in pakistan monday with a groundswell of popularity under him nawaz sharif a two time former prime minister has emerged just recently as a threat to gen musharrafs efforts to gain another term as president eight years ago gen musharraf ousted mr sharif from power in a bloodless coup and installed a military backed government mr sharif went into exile in saudi arabia but mr sharifs political fortunes have soared recently as he has fashioned himself as a champion of democratic rule at a time when gen musharrafs political stock has plummeted forcing the president to seek an alliance with another old foe ms bhutto who also has been living abroad the talks between the two camps have hurt ms bhuttos popularity as well and buoyed the year old mr sharifs standing with the electorate "after years of independence there are still just two kinds of politicians in pakistan those who play into the hands of tinpots and those who resist them " says syeda abida hussain formerly a minister under mr sharif "nawaz to his credit has stood up to the military " gen musharraf and ms bhutto may get a chance to reclaim the political spotlight they are expected soon to unveil an agreement that would allow gen musharraf to serve a second term as president after an election in the next few weeks and ms bhutto to run for prime minister in elections later this year or early next a spokesman for ms bhutto said yesterday that a pact was almost concluded after talks in dubai a government spokesman acknowledged the talks and said the government hoped for a positive outcome under the prospective deal gen musharrafs government is expected to help remove a constitutional amendment banning prime ministers from serving three terms in office which currently is an obstacle for ms bhutto earlier the two sides resolved the contentious issue of gen musharrafs retirement from the military which he also heads though the timing of that move is unclear gen musharraf is standing for election to another presidential term in a vote that must be taken between sept and oct he is expected to win because the voting is done by an electoral college made up of parliamentarians and members of four state assemblies while opposition leaders could create turmoil and further undermine his authority ms bhuttos support may diminish that possibility even as political maneuverings move forward gen musharraf an important u s ally confronts an increasingly grim security situation yesterday two bombs exploded outside pakistans capital islamabad killing at least people one blast occurred on an army bus although no one claimed responsibility officials believe islamic militants may have acted in revenge for army attacks on the afghanistan border that area is a suspected stronghold of al qaeda fighters mr sharifs return to pakistan was made possible by a supreme court ruling last month he heads a party the pakistan muslim league n that is seen as bringing together both pakistans religious conservatives and secular democrats opposed to gen musharrafs government analysts warn that mr sharifs hard line stand against gen musharraf carries political risks a confrontation with the government could incite more violence and allow the military to reassert control over the country says husain haqqani director of boston universitys center for international relations who served as an adviser to both mr sharif and ms bhutto that mr sharif is now in a possible position to determine pakistans fate marks the latest chapter in a long political career during which he has often benefited from going along with the military not against it a scion of one of the countrys richest business families from lahore mr sharif was groomed by military ruler gen mohammad zia ul haq in when he was years old mr sharif left his fathers steel business to become finance minister of the powerful state of punjab four years later he became punjabs chief minister or top civil servant during a period of martial law after he led a political alliance to victory in the parliamentary elections mr sharif became pakistans prime minister he was dismissed midway through his term in following differences with the president and the army he and his party returned to power with a huge majority in february in office mr sharif wasnt renowned for his protection of basic freedoms in hundreds of his supporters stormed the supreme court as it heard a contempt case against him a spokesman for mr sharif iqbal ahsan blamed the incident on the courts refusal to issue more passes to the public through much of his political career mr sharif courted the military and religious conservatives one bill that he introduced which ultimately failed to pass would have introduced islamic sharia law to the criminal justice system mr sharifs government also arrested several prominent journalists including najam sethi now the editor of pakistans daily times although a frequent critic of gen musharraf mr sethi says the current military backed government has in fact done much more to liberalize the media that has led to an explosion of private television and radio stations and new print publications "our biggest fear has been civilian autocrats " said mr sethi in an interview mr sharifs supporters say he fits into pakistans moderate middle that many western governments find politically palatable his pro business policies and stance on antiterrorism would make pakistan a better ally of the u s than it is now under gen musharraf they argue but the u s has been much more actively encouraging a deal between gen musharraf and ms bhutto u s officials say they increasingly realize that a political deal between gen musharraf and ms bhutto could play into mr sharifs hands at least in the short term many current and former u s officials express similar concerns about mr sharifs return to pakistani politics as they do about ms bhuttos viewing him as an indecisive leader whose earlier governments tolerated corruption and undermined pakistans economy but they say his unwillingness to negotiate with pakistans military so far will likely help him at the polls "sharifs numbers seem to have spiked" because of the talks between ms bhutto and gen musharraf said a u s official working on pakistan "benazir doesnt want to be seen as sacrificing her principles " still the bush administration increasingly believes gen musharraf needs both ms bhutto and mr sharif inside the electoral system to provide pakistans military leader the political space to continue with his war against al qaeda and other militant islamist groups most u s officials believe gen musharraf will ultimately come into some political accommodation with both former prime ministers mr sharifs backers also say mr sharif has altered his views toward the courts since his period as prime minister and would for instance ensure judicial appointments are based on merit according to mr iqbal the sharif spokesman mr sharif wasnt available for comment "he didnt appreciate it to the extent that he appreciates it now " says mr iqbal secretary of the pakistan muslim league n under mr sharif a rival party faction by a similar name pakistan muslim league q is aligned with gen musharraf as prime minister mr sharif gravitated toward a pragmatic foreign policy particularly on ties with the u s although the u s government had imposed sanctions on pakistan related to nuclear arms proliferation mr sharif proved a willing partner in the battle against islamic extremists according to a senior pakistani diplomat mr sharif promised the clinton administration in that he would deliver al qaeda kingpin osama bin laden a few months later though mr sharifs government fell he was overthrown following an incident in which his army chief gen musharraf wasnt allowed to land at an airport until his plane had only minutes of fuel to spare in march an antiterrorism court sentenced mr sharif to life in prison on hijacking and treason charges mr sharif denies the charges later that year mr sharif secured passage out of jail and into exile jay solomon
