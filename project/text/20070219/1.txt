the doctors office concerns about privacy rules can complicate good care online edition the phone call from the ob department at a m jarred me awake i was needed for emergency surgery a pregnant woman whom id never seen before had come to the hospital after hemorrhaging at home she thought her water broke but instead she was bleeding heavily she arrived at our bed rural hospital without any available medical records and no local doctor her usual doctor worked miles away at a large regional hospital she needed an emergency c section and out of necessity i performed surgery on her with very limited information about her allergies and past medical history initially there wasnt time to request her old records at a m the medical records department at the larger hospital wasnt open though the ob department was they said they werent allowed to send a copy of the records they had without a signed authorization from the patient my patient was too ill to sign anything at that moment later in the day during business hours we still couldnt get a copy of her prenatal records for ongoing treatment without a signed authorization from the recovering patient she and the nearly lb baby boy did fine doctors and hospitals are supposed to be able to share information about a patients medical treatment without signed consent forms and other red tape too bad that isnt working the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa was in part supposed to make the exchange of medical information easier related patient privacy rules took effect in under the rules doctors must get permission if they say release information to a patients employer neighbor relatives or outside marketers but patient consent isnt required for release for some other situations including treatment before the privacy regulations doctors hospitals and their medical records personnel relied on their professional ethics and individual policies when exchanging information it worked well for most emergencies in a pinch i could get the information i needed with a phone call initially i was hopeful that the complexity and cost of the privacy provisions would be made up for by easier flow of critical information from my perspective it hasnt worked out so well i face bureaucracy bureaucracy that the letter of the law doesnt require with virtually every hospital and health care entity i deal with after extensive training on the privacy provisions many hospital personnel became fearful of disclosing information to anybody for anything without a signed consent form there are many nuances to the law that are too much for the average records clerk to master eleven years later we still dont have a free flow of information and computer system interoperability that the law was supposed to foster but we do have the hassle and expense of dealing with the privacy parts and in my view protection of patient privacy between doctors and doctors and hospitals wasnt a problem that needed solving before hipaa my office spent about &# on staff training when the privacy provisions first went into effect we spent &# to transition from paper charts to electronic records many factors went into the decision to go electronic but one of the primary ones was hipaa i didnt feel i could properly safeguard paper charts and keep any kind of audit trail about who accessed the charts when they were paper the electronic medical record allows me to limit access for certain personnel and track who has opened a chart both concerns under the hipaa privacy provisions my partner tried to get a medication list from the county mental health department for a suicidal patient we had called into the office recently her request was rebuffed by the staff because we didnt have a signed consent form the patient really wasnt thinking logically enough to consent to anything at that point and she wasnt in our office to sign a form the patient was subsequently hospitalized but without her medication list or treatment notes i try a different approach when record requests come my way when an elderly patient of mine had a heart attack on a sunday morning while out of town her daughter called my house as the ambulance was arriving i hooked up to my office computer from home and faxed the patients chart and old ekg to the hospital er before the patient even arrived unfortunately the patient didnt make it but her records did theo francis contributed to this story write to dr benjamin brewer at thedoctorsoffice wsj com
