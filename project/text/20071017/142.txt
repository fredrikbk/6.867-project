day sign up for the e mail here the turkish government today is on the verge of getting parliamentary approval for military strikes at turkish kurdish rebels in iraq a scenario feared by war critics since the u s led invasion and one reverberating around the region and back to washington parliamentary debate in ankara somewhat of a formality considering the popular support for retaliation among most turks is set to start at a m et turkish leaders have said an incursion wouldnt immediately follow legislative consent and diplomacy aimed at averting an actual offensive was in play on several fronts a military operation into the kurdish region of northern iraq could play havoc with iraqs already messy politics and stir trouble in what has been the most peaceful part of the country "an invasion would raise a host of messy issues for baghdad as it struggles to exert control amid bloody sectarian conflict " the wall street journal notes especially since iraqi kurd security forces are "overwhelmed from guarding the border with the rest of iraq to prevent infiltration by sunni arab extremists " moreover the landlocked region relies on turkey for many of its imports and will need turkish pipelines to ship out its oil the journal adds turkeys nato qualified military is probably strongest in the region with the exception perhaps of u s forces there and in the past ankara has used threats of military action to make syria curb kurdish activity on its side of the border iraqi leaders may be hoping the current bellicosity is just a threat for now and iraqi vice president tariq al hashimi yesterday traveled to turkey to seek the chance to stop rebels from the pkk the kurdistan workers party "who cross the border before turkey takes any step " he said and after meeting turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan mr hashimi added "i got what i wanted from our talks there is a new atmosphere to stop the current crisis " the spike in turkish iraqi tension which helped push oil prices to a new record yesterday as the journal reports comes when the region is already the subject of several different geopolitical power plays yesterday in tehran for example russian president putin helped forge an alliance of caspian sea nations who oppose the prospect of any western military action against iran even as he pledged to help complete an internationally controversial iranian nuclear plant as the times of london reports iran azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan along with russia agreed to keep other countries from using their territories for military strikes against another of the group with mr putin asserting "it is important that we not only not use any kind of force but also do not even think about the possibility of using force " but officials in ankara probably had their eyes more on washington than tehran street demonstration in turkey suggest opposition to a u s genocide label on the mass killings of ethnic armenians nearly a century ago is at least as heartfelt there as support for retaliation against the pkk and american leverage over longtime ally turkey has been weakened by congressional consideration of the house resolution that would declare the armenians deaths genocide recognition of the resolutions cost back in turkey is apparently responsible for a sudden waning of support in the house and a dozen house members from both parties shifted against the measure over hours the new york times reports "some made clear that they were heeding warnings from the white house which has called the measure dangerously provocative and from the turkish government which has said house passage would prompt turkey to reconsider its ties to the united states including logistical support for the iraq war " the times said others said that "while they deplored the mass killings of armenians by the ottoman empire the modern day consequences in the middle east could not be overlooked " and what it says for darfur it also seems to be the accepted political wisdom that modern day consequences make it easier to condemn past genocidal acts than to do something about wholesale ethnic religious or racial killings taking place today african union and united nations officials tell the times they are "are looking into reports of a new massacre in darfur in which witnesses said sudanese government troops and their allied militias had killed more than civilians slitting the throats of several men praying at a mosque and shooting a year old boy in the back as he tried to run away " this latest massacre or just the latest to be reported comes more than three years after congress passed a resolution declaring the killings in darfur to be genocide and president bush did the same in a speech to the united nations while such a designation was long thought to "inevitably trigger an international response " wrote political science professor scott straus "terminology turns out to matter far less than was expected and once more the world has dithered while people die " he wrote that in the january february issue of foreign affairs in a probe of food supplies to troops in iraq the justice department and pentagon have opened investigations into deals that perdue farms sara lee conagra foods and other american companies arranged to supply the military with food in iraq people involved in the inquiry tell the wall street journal the federal probe of possible fraud and corruption "is focused on whether the food companies set excessively high prices when they sold their goods to the armys primary food contractor for the war zone a kuwaiti firm called public warehousing " the journal reports the companies in question arranged their deals with the help of ex pentagon procurement officials they had hired as consultants or executives the paper adds "public warehousing bought vast amounts of meat vegetables and bakery items from the food companies and delivered them to u s troops " the journal says and "a related question is whether public warehousing improperly pocketed for itself refunds it received from these suppliers " the federal investigators also want to learn more about the role army officials played in choosing public warehousings suppliers "sometimes the army demands specific brands of food from specific manufacturers " the journal says separately senior administration officials and pentagon advisers tell the new york times that "defense secretary robert m gates is pressing for the nearly armed security contractors now working for the united states government in iraq to fall under a single authority most likely the american military in an effort to bring blackwater usa under tighter control " producers back off big demand of writers the hollywood studios and television networks have backed off a proposal to significantly reduce the residual payments writers get when tv shows and films are shown in new markets in reruns and on video in what variety calls a "a dramatic gesture" aimed at cooling down contract talks that seemed headed for a strike "though both sides remain far apart tuesdays move by the alliance of motion picture &amp television producers puts a halt for a few days at least to the pervasive gloom and doom that had overtaken the industry in recent weeks " variety says the announcement by nick counter the studios and networks chief negotiator was the first conciliatory gesture by either side since july the "talent" have received such residual payments for decades and as part of the recent negotiations for a new contract the studios sought to pay residuals only after they had first recouped their rising production and marketing costs even with yesterdays reversal mr counter said the studios and networks wouldnt increase home video and digital download residuals for movies and tv shows something the writers guild had demanded the los angeles times points out "many in hollywood are preparing for what would be the first writers walkout in nearly two decades beginning as early as next month " the times adds and "though the action doesnt bring the two sides much closer to making a deal before the current contract expires oct "
