tax report why taxpayers are leaving billions on the table many fail to claim deductions tied to local outlays millions of people overlooked an important tax break and made other costly mistakes earlier this year on their returns according to a recent report by the u s treasury inspector general for tax administration a treasury department unit for example nearly million taxpayers who were eligible to deduct their state and local sales taxes didnt do so up from the previous year these people missed taking advantage of potentially &# billion in deductions treasury auditors said many people also neglected to claim a one time telephone excise tax refund eric smith an irs spokesman said yesterday that nearly of all individual return filers had requested the refund as of early september in all about million filed for refunds totaling about &# billion the treasury report said the irs had expected to hand out about &# billion some people however made mistakes in their favor for example taxpayers improperly took additional exemptions for housing victims of hurricane katrina some people who are older than claimed improper deductions for an individual retirement account and some people made the mistake of claiming a dual benefit of both the tuition and fees deduction and an education credit the treasury units report concluded that the tax filing season "generally" was successful and also said "most" returns were "timely and accurately" processed by the irs but the report also contained fresh reminders of just how easy it is to make mistakes if you discover an error on your return theres a simple remedy file whats known as an amended return use form x which is available on the irs web site www irs gov but note that you cant file an amended return electronically youll have to do it the old fashioned paper way how could so many people make mistakes especially in view of the growing numbers who rely on tax professionals or tax preparation software to prepare their returns one simple answer is the tax laws growing complexity "taxes are hard and there are lots and lots of things to keep track of particularly if youre still doing it by hand " says mel schwarz a partner in the national tax office of grant thornton llp in washington but part of the blame lies with congressional delays in taking action last year lawmakers didnt act until very late in the year to extend the life of several tax provisions that had expired at the end of congress didnt act until after the irs deadline for sending forms and publications to the printer one of those provisions gives taxpayers who itemize the option of deducting their state and local sales taxes instead of their state and local income taxes this is especially important for millions of people who live in florida texas nevada washington and other states that dont have a state income tax it is also useful for people in many other states with low taxes the irs agreed with a treasury recommendation to do more to inform people about the sales tax deduction rule whether this provision will still be around for the tax year is anyones guess why so many people didnt bother to claim the phone refund remains unclear in a separate report the treasury unit said "we believe a significant amount" of the telephone excise tax that had been collected by the irs "may never be refunded " the report said "many" people apparently were "simply unaware" of the refund or didnt realize they qualified for it separately treasury auditors found a small number of people who mistakenly had claimed ira deductions even though they were older than in response the irs agreed to add a statement to the top of the ira work sheet saying taxpayers age or older cant take the deduction the irs also will revise wording on certain lines of the work sheet a guide to tax proposals by presidential candidates is now available online the tax policy center www taxpolicycenter org a joint venture of the urban
