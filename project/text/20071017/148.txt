will the internet be good for what ails us bill gatess vision of a cost efficient highly effective and highly it enabled health care system is a worthy dream "health care needs an internet revolution " editorial page oct the problem is that in the current environment health care is not organized or structured to satisfy patient needs and enable or support the work of practitioners but has been distorted in focus to serve the interests of third party payers and defend against litigious predators the best available environment in which a system such as mr gates envisions could develop now is probably in the growing "sub rosa" health care system wherein practitioners are contracting directly with patients for services outside of third party payer systems these have recently been referred to in the media as "boutique medicine" practices the free market no doubt holds many elegant solutions cures and preventive regimens and free market health care would lead to superlatives beyond our imagination but a free market will never exist in this sector of our economy unless there is dramatic change in our political environment which in turn requires a sea change in public sentiment about who is ultimately responsible for an individuals health and well being michael neely kirkwood mo mr gates alludes to a never replicated study claiming that patients die yearly from medical errors like others he accepts this figure uncritically despite the fact that the study contained numerous biases and the conclusions are not supported by what is known to be true about medical errors from ongoing reporting to health departments of many states he has an unreal expectation that computer based advice to patients will motivate them to alter their lifestyles to lower their risk of acquiring chronic diseases i can and do counsel lifestyle change to my patients most of them nod smile and continue to do the opposite does mr gates really believe an integrated network of computers can improve that reality daniel c smith m d burnsville minn mr gates proposes an internet based health care network to enable sharing of health care information and prevent errors clearly having numerous systems that dont talk to each other within and among institutions presents a challenge to creating one "source of truth " patients are unaware of their own health data and to some degree dont even feel its their responsibility to know what procedures theyve had what medications they are on etc yet this solution at this time appears to be a treatment far worse than the disease how will such a system guard everyones privacy against hackers now instead of only receiving credit card offers and spams per day we can receive personalized junk mail addressed to "dear prozac user " marci m lesperance m d ann arbor mich "dr bill" gates prescribes a higher dose of computers and digital technology to help cure what ails our healthcare system however most patients already have access to a computer and often tell their doctors they have done their "research" on the internet but most people do not have the knowledge and training to effectively use the mountain of medical data currently available to them why is it that man who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client but in health care patients are encouraged to "take ownership" and rely less on physicians brian d kent m d orange calif see related letter "letters to the editor every person should own his own medical history" wsj oct
