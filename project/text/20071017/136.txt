the daily fix indians ambush wakefield bosox move to brink of the world series online edition how do you lift the spell of a curse thats held sway for nearly years an inch at a time of course that inch was crucial in the fifth inning of last nights game between the cleveland indians and the boston red sox cleveland led with men on the corners and one out when asdrubal cabrera hit the ball on a line back at boston knuckleballer tim wakefield "if such a ball had streaked at him in may or august the year old vet might have remembered in a blink where his infielders were positioned and simply allowed the ball to pass him untouched " writes thomas boswell in the washington post "if he had the drive wouldve skipped straight to dustin pedroia standing near second base for the easiest of double plays step on the bag flip to first on such infinitesimal moments whole seasons sometimes can turn it may not be fair but its certainly the nature of playoff baseball in which every break resounds like a rifle shot in both dugouts " the ball trickled off mr wakefields glove for an infield hit and a indians lead next came victor martinez whose single made it and sent mr wakefield to the showers facing manny delcarmen jhonny peralta crushed a three run homer cleveland wound up hitting for minutes and finished the inning up enough to withstand back to back to back home runs by bostons kevin youkilis david ortiz and manny ramirez who admired his drive as if it had won the game instead of being merely cosmetic cleveland now leads the series and can advance to the world series against the colorado rockies tomorrow night "for improbabilities that push hard against the boundaries of what seems possible baseball in october seems to hold a unique place in sports " mr boswell writes "the game establishes parameters for our expectations over a six month season then in a fraction of that time it smashes our assumptions to pieces with glee " the rockies in fourth place on sept are now winners of of the indians payroll is dwarfed by that of the defeated new york yankees and the on the brink red sox no matter as mr boswell writes "on a roaring night at chanting towel waving jacobs field we were given yet another example of how subtly almost quixotically postseason baseball chooses its champions what was the turning point of this crucial game a boston pitcher forgot to do nothing " in the cleveland plain dealer bill livingston celebrates the nights winning pitcher "paul byrd with his high socks and double pump windup seems to have stepped out of some dimly remembered era in baseballs past when teams traveled by train and the dodgers were in brooklyn " he writes "the last hurrah for his style was probably during the first expansion era in the early s when there was such a crying need for pitching that a lot of arm motion could disguise the fact that the actual pitch was hardly overpowering born of necessity to trick up byrds delivery and generate a little more oomph on his fastball after labrum surgery with kansas city five years ago the windup today makes him unique he is a throwback but not a thrower paul byrd is a pitcher " in the boston globe bob ryan has a warning for red sox nation "please dont think theres really anything odd about whats going on the cleveland indians are good they won games same as the red sox and they did it with a nice finishing kick that included a head to head wipeout of their chief central division rivals the detroit tigers it was no shock when they dispatched the yankees in four games and it would be no shock if they were to dispose of the red sox in five either " with bostons josh beckett returning to the hill against clevelands c c sabathia tomorrow night the hartford courants jeff jacobs sounds a more hopeful note "only five teams in major league history have come back from a deficit " he writes "the good news is the red sox have done it twice against the angels in the alcs and of course against the yankees in a third time came in the nlcs when beckett beat the cubs in game and returned to pitch four innings of relief for the marlins in game suffice to say there are guys in the red sox clubhouse who know about all time comebacks " the rockies must wait another week to play baseball again leaving plenty of time for columnists to take their measure and pose questions such as how did the rockies come back from the depths of sept and how did they emerge from their years in the baseball wilderness in the new york times alan schwarz studies what went wrong and what went right as gm dan odowd and his team sought to transform the rockies "as a team built on young pitching staunch defense and timely hitting most of it patiently cultivated in the minor leagues rather than purchased with fat checks the rockies collective persona could enchant even the most hardened traditionalists " he writes "this team was not always so conventional in fact its current forehead slapping success was preceded by just as sensational runs of ineptitude bred by team construction disasters imagine if one company had produced the apple newton the ford edsel and new coke in a span of four years and you have the early s colorado rockies " in the new york sun tim marchman writes that the teams been lucky and warns against mistaking luck for virtue "as success becomes more improbable and as its sustained by more and more spectacular luck the team still remains the same team it was in august with no more or less character or ability than it had before it went on a rampage " he writes "what changed were the rockies circumstances which suddenly endowed the team with all sorts of unappreciated virtues much as a sudden bequest of millions of dollars from an admirer would suddenly find me endowed with all sorts of wit and wisdom no one had previously noticed good on the rockies for taking advantage of their opportunities their pennant comes with no asterisk even wins though dont make you something other than what you are " if thats too grinchlike for you try the rocky mountain newss bernie lincicome who nominates the rockies for americas team good fortune and all "dumb luck yes that too a bounce here a bounce there none of it happens there is a sense of winning the lottery to this coming from where the rockies were to where they are going next a team once nine games on the losing side a team that had to count on itself but also lean on others a team that saw opportunity and kept it on a leash a team that found a sense of wonder in a simple game and never forgot to enjoy the journey thats americas team " on march jason ray the university of north carolina senior who served as rameses the tarheels mascot was struck by a vehicle while walking back to a new jersey hotel before uncs sweet sixteen game against usc mr ray died three days later on espn com wayne drehs writes about mr ray a hard headed soft hearted kid who loved being a youth minister the lead singer of a rock band and a beer aficionado he was also an organ donor a decision he made at over his mothers objections "if something happens to me and i have a heart that could help save someones life then what good does it do to bury that heart in the ground " he asked her "that doesnt make any sense at all " mr rays death is only the beginning of an extraordinary story to say more would be to ruin a tale
