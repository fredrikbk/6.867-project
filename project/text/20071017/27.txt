business bookshelf the sound of nashville selling air castle of the south by craig havighurst university of illinois press pages &# with scarcely a dozen years left before the th anniversary of commercial radio in the industry is battling a sense that its best days are long in the past and radios future is hard to discern through all the static in the air changing consumer attitudes and the introduction of new technologies such as the mp player and souped up cellphones have undermined the mediums role as the dominant provider of audio news and entertainment in the midst of commercial radios struggles comes a reminder of its glory days when stations soaring transmitter towers seemed like monuments to the broadcasters influence "air castle of the south " by craig havighurst tells the story of one such station nashvilles wsm am it was central to the popularization of country music and helped spawn nashvilles entertainment industry which was valued at &# billion annually in a belmont university study last year while mr havighurst a music journalist and documentarian is most interested in the stations cultural import "air castle of the south" also presents a fascinating case study in the rise of commercial broadcasting from its inception wsm was about selling selling everything from insurance policies to baby chicks from baking flour to the wonders of nashville itself but especially insurance policies wsm was the brainchild of edwin craig a "wireless buff" whose family held a major stake in the nashville based national life and accident insurance co motto "we shield millions " in craig sold his radio idea to a skeptical board as an innovative promotional tool an efficient way to raise the companys profile in the countless small towns where footsore national life "shield men" worked door to door sales and collection routes craig positioned his new shiny thing as a public service of national life the station offered a mix of popular and classical music along with lectures and sermons by local worthies all of it live and initially without commercials just a few months after its debut wsm filled a saturday night gap in its schedule with a "barn dance" program that would become known as the "grand ole opry " clearly the foot stompin fiddle driven show was an instant hit in rural middle tennessee throngs of rustics jammed wsms hallways every saturday night hoping to catch a glimpse of the performers on the broadcast the reaction inside the city gates was less enthusiastic nashvilles aristocracy which fancied its town "the athens of the south " got a severe case of the vapors when previously refined wsm began featuring what was then known as "hillbilly music " but edwin craig was the only member of the elite whose opinion mattered and he quickly recognized that the "opry" gave national life a powerful entree with rural customers to boost the shows credibility with that important market segment "opry" bosses early on ordered performers to ditch their suits and dresses for overalls floppy hats and checkered shirts established bands were rebranded with "cornball cliches " mr havighurst writes such as "the fruit jar drinkers" and "the possum hunters " by the s with wsm an nbc radio network affiliate the "grand ole opry" was heard coast to coast the shows weekly live broadcasts from ryman auditorium in nashville drew sell out crowds who clapped and laughed along with the likes of roy acuff hank williams and minnie pearl how delightful to discover that miss pearl she of the price tag adorned straw hat and gingham dresses was played by a genteel woman named sarah cannon who worked tirelessly to mend the rift between nashvilles showbiz folk and socialites how disappointing to learn that her signature "how dee " greeting was suggested by a new york ad agency the "opry" moved tons of product for both local and national advertisers thanks in large part to live commercials delivered by beloved cast members the selling didnt stop at the end of the show shield men learned to walk through their assigned neighborhoods on warm saturday nights and make note of houses where the "opry" broadcast was playing on monday the salesmen would knock on those doors introduce themselves as being "from wsm" and proffer a national life sales brochure featuring pictures of "opry" performers country musicians who in the early days made most of their money by performing as opposed to selling records quickly recognized the radio shows power to fill a tour schedule in the anything goes early days of the "opry " fiddlers were known to travel hundreds of miles at their own expense hoping for a few minutes of on air playin and pluggin as the "opry" grew more professional and influential every string band musician aspired to become a cast member a status that guaranteed steady work both on the saturday broadcasts and at outside gigs arranged by the show in a brilliant scheme to generate publicity and revenue for itself and for the appreciative musicians wsms ability to attract develop and hold talent of all types was crucial to nashvilles rise as the center of country music station employees and alumni started the citys first record labels opened recording facilities and founded song publishing ventures including the renowned acuff rose music in wsm management irked by the outside influence and money amassed by "opry" director jim denny barred employees from moonlighting in the music business as a result many experienced staffers left the show and wsm to start or expand their own enterprises the edict was akin to blowing on a dandelion that has gone to seed a pivotal act of creative destruction that greatly diminished wsms influence over country music but set the stage for the explosive growth of nashvilles recording industry by according to one count nashville had song publishers and recording studios national life skillfully rode the country music wave across the century cashing in on every new technology and marketing opportunity the companys entertainment holdings eventually grew to include wsm fm wsm tv cable televisions the nashville network and the opryland usa theme park which surprised experts by developing into a major tourism engine for nashville when national life was acquired by american general corp in those properties minus wsm tv were sold to gaylord entertainment which later sold or shuttered all of them gaylord held on to wsm am and the "grand ole opry " where an invitation to perform remains a powerful affirmation for a rising country music star as for wsm am it began a slow downward drift in the s losing listeners and revenue to narrowly targeted fm music stations despite its close assocation with country music wsm did not go all country until the late s while other am powerhouses managed to pull out of similar death spirals typically by adopting an all talk format wsm was weighted down by a history of insularity and an abhorrence of change it can be argued that wsm settled its own fate in the mid s when station management refused to add rock n roll to its wide ranging playlist and turned elvis presley away from the "grand ole opry" after one appearance fearing that his rockabilly sound and swiveling hips would alienate old time fans today wsm am is a niche player offering a twangy alternative to modern country music the station which a few years ago adopted the motto "too country and proud of it " was ranked th in nashville in a recent arbitron ratings report as history "air castle of the south" is engaging but less than definitive its long on anecdote and sentiment "demanding that wsm live or die by the media economys new rules feels a bit like asking your grandmother to work at burger king to make ends meet" but short on analysis recent years have seen the dissolution of gaylords "opry" centered media empire and the final stage of wsms descent from broadcast powerhouse to radio curiosity more thorough contemporary reporting would have helped buttress the books contention that gaylords corporate strategy which included the much criticized closing of the opryland usa theme park in after attendance began slipping has endangered nashvilles future as a major hub of the entertainment industry still mr havighurst has done a service in preserving the colorful and instructive history of wsm and in reminding us that giants once lived on the radio dial mr bloomquist is the program director of news talk wgst am in atlanta
