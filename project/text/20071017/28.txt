behind subprime woes a cascade of bad bets one loans journey shows culture of risk the fall of a fund whiz three years ago colorado truck driver roger rodriguez was in the market for a new mortgage loan with radio and internet ads trumpeting easy approvals he picked up the phone that call set into motion mr rodriguezs descent into the subprime mortgage mess over the next several months his adjustable rate loan passed through many hands these included a local denver broker livingston n j finance company cit group inc and a greenwich conn unit of royal bank of scotland group plc eventually a piece of mr rodriguezs loan landed in mutual funds run by a tennessee investor named james c kelsoe jr little good has come to any party that touched the loan mr rodriguez now years old has lost both his job and his home all the middlemen from the broker to cit to rbs have either shuttered their mortgage businesses or are struggling mr kelsoe once a star mutual fund manager has hit a career low as defaults on subprime mortgages decreased the value of his investments the paper trail from mr rodriguez to mr kelsoe illustrates how the mortgage market meltdown scalded millions of homeowners and investors it also foreshadows how the domino effect stands to continue much of the mortgage lending of the past several years as well as investments in mortgage backed securities was based on assumptions that left little room for error as a result even slight deviations from a perfect world in which people act prudently unemployment stays low lenders keep lending and house prices rise pose risks in the form of more defaults foreclosures and other investment losses behind the market turmoil of recent months lending standards were more lax than most people imagined a fact that surfaced when house prices stalled the mortgage crisis is "a case study on the way that greed convinced everyone there wasnt risk " says ivy zelman ceo of zelman &amp associates an independent real estate research firm should house prices fall by over the next two years an outcome analysts see as entirely possible losses stand to be staggering thomas zimmerman head of mortgage credit research at ubs in new york estimates that in such a scenario losses due to defaults could wipe out as much as of the nearly &# billion in subprime backed securities issued in in august such losses were equivalent to less than of the total the jobs market also plays a key role if the unemployment rate ticks upward by a percentage point or more mr zimmerman believes losses due to defaults could easily exceed enough to hit even some of the most highly rated securities back in mr rodriguez didnt realize he was meandering into trouble two decades earlier he had moved from powell wyo to start a new life in colorado after struggling as a sugar beet farmer he his wife irene and two grandchildren now and took up residence in a modest development called prospectors point in the town of westminster where their home boasted unobstructed rocky mountain views mr rodriguez held a steady job driving a recycling truck for waste management inc sometime in the fall of mr rodriguez decided he could use some money for debt consolidation he turned to a company called equityrelief com which promoted itself on the radio and the internet with slogans such as "debt relief is stress relief at equityrelief com " the denver company already had handled his &# mortgage two years earlier he says still suffering from marginal credit he enlisted the mortgage broker once again within a matter of weeks mr rodriguez had secured a new mortgage for &# from finance company cit group that was enough to settle his outstanding home loan as well as cover auto debts and a few home repairs his income about &# a month before taxes enabled him to pay the &# initial monthly note plus living expenses and installments on his credit card debts but with hardly any savings he had little wiggle room in case something went wrong beyond that the monthly payment was scheduled to reset after two years most likely to a higher level a common feature of so called adjustable rate mortgages or arms mr rodriguezs low credit score meant it would have been difficult for him to obtain a prime loan he says he chose an arm with an introductory rate of because thats what the broker offered "i just went along with it " he says "they made it so easy " at the time a prime year fixed rate mortgage had an interest rate of but the introductory rate on mr rodriguezs arm would apply for just two years before resetting up to a maximum of bryon veal who ran the brokerage says he typically warned customers to use adjustable rate products only if they planned to be in a property for a short period of time mr veal also says his firm advised borrowers that rates would increase around this time hundreds of thousands of borrowers and the lenders who served them were beginning to make even more optimistic assumptions about their ability to handle subprime debt lenders frequently approved borrowers for loans based only on their credit score and often without verifying income and they effectively ignored the fact that monthly notes would later reset the universal hopeful assumption with house prices rising borrowers would be able to refinance before the rate increases hit back in lenders in the subprime sphere had little reason to worry whether borrowers were getting in over their heads thats because they often quickly resold some of the loans at a profit wall street banks snapped them up packaged them into securities and sold them on to investors cit was no exception in the company which offers loans for everything from heavy equipment to college tuition was building its business of originating and selling home mortgages within five months cit had sold mr rodriguezs loan along with others to rbs greenwich capital a unit of the royal bank of scotland located in the tony financial hub of greenwich to obtain such loans rbs had to outbid other investment banks active in the mortgage market such as lehman brothers holdings inc j p morgan chase &amp co deutsche bank ag and bear stearns cos rbs was making an aggressive bet on the mortgage business sharply boosting its capacity to buy and package loans by it had risen to third place among investment banks by volume of u s residential mortgage backed securitizations according to thomson financial that was up from sixth place in rbs and cit declined to say how much they profited at various points in the mortgage securitization process generally speaking as the loans progress through the chain buyers and sellers skim a bit from each sale profits from the securities are usually determined by a complex set of factors including cash flow which is affected by timely payments from borrowers like mr rodriguez in february rbs packaged mr rodriguezs loan along with others into a trust called soundview the trust slices the cash flows from the loans into notes with different levels of risk and return within five days rbss sales team had sold &# million in soundview notes to investors around the world one buyer was mr kelsoe a senior portfolio manager at the asset management unit of morgan keegan &amp co a memphis tenn investment firm and unit of regions financial corp at the time mr kelsoe was riding the housing boom by investing heavily in mortgage backed securities at the end of his rmk select high income fund showed a five year average annual gain of nearly according to morningstar inc that performance beat all u s high yield funds as well as the dow jones industrial average his success brought him a bit of celebrity he appeared on cnbc was quoted in the wall street journal and gave investing lectures at universities "he talked about the importance of identifying and assessing risk " says wilburn lane head of the business school at lambuth university in jackson tenn mr kelsoe spoke there in october to some local businesspeople over a chicken and vegetables lunch mr lane who says he was impressed with the year olds track record later invested in one of the seven funds managed by mr kelsoe mr kelsoes big returns though depended heavily on the good fortune of borrowers such as mr rodriguez through various of his funds mr kelsoe invested nearly &# million in one of the soundview trusts riskiest pieces the b tranche as it was called offered a return of at least percentage points above the london interbank offered rate a key short term rate at which banks lend to each other but if borrowers like mr rodriguez began to default on their loans any losses exceeding of the entire loan pool could eat into the value of the b tranche in february at least one borrower in the soundview trust had a big piece of bad luck after pulling into a waste management repair facility in the denver suburb of commerce city mr rodriguez detached the trailer from his wheel rig but forgot to set the brake on the tractor the tractor rolled across a street and hit a parked pickup truck causing about &# in damage soon afterward says mr rodriguez waste management fired him "they considered that a critical rollaway " he said waste management confirmed that mr rodriguez no longer works for the company but declined to provide details "ten seconds can change your whole life around " mr rodriguez says a friend remarked to him recently mr rodriguez took on odd jobs working on a paving crew and in a bakery but his income fell to about &# a month in to make matters worse the monthly note on his mortgage reset to more than &# in november he fell behind on the higher payments on feb a denver law firm acting on behalf of the soundview trust began foreclosure proceedings against mr rodriguez and his wife the firm cited "failure to pay monthly payments of principal and interest" on an outstanding balance of &# colorado real estate documents show mr rodriguez filed for bankruptcy protection on july a move that extended the time he could remain in his home by several months other borrowers in the soundview trust also began to default on their loans by june defaults had afflicted of the loan pool more than triple the level of a year earlier according to people familiar with the trusts finances about four in loans were at least days in arrears all in a period during which the u s economy was growing at a healthy pace and unemployment was low because mr kelsoes investment in the b tranche was so sensitive to losses its market price plunged in fact as trading in subprime backed securities dried up amid a broader panic mr kelsoe like other investors with subprime holdings had difficulty figuring out what the investments were worth at the end of june the latest information available mr kelsoes funds reported an estimated market value of the soundview investment that was below what they had paid a morgan keegan spokeswoman said mr kelsoe wasnt available to comment because he was focused on managing his funds at the end of august mr kelsoes select high income fund posted a loss of nearly for the month dead last among its peers for the year and for five years as well according

markets"ocean of liquidity has quickly become a desert " in a letter to a memphis newspaper charles reaves an attorney who had invested in one of mr kelsoes funds wrote that mr kelsoe was "hiding under his desk" and "should have the fortitude to face the public and explain what he intends to do " things havent gone much better for the mortgage units at cit and rbs though they did profit handsomely during the good times cit citing a "problematic outlook" for the business in july announced plans to shut down its mortgage business and lay off about employees a cit spokeswoman says its mortgage portfolio performed better than peers morale at rbs greenwich had suffered in recent weeks as employees braced for layoffs rbs greenwich recently eliminated of its jobs in the first half of the year total income for the companys u s asset backed securities business which includes mortgage backed securities fell to &# million an rbs spokeswoman said "in common with all players our operations have been scaled back to reflect the lower volumes of business across the industry " late this summer mr rodriguez sat on a courthouse bench after his bankruptcy hearing "im under a lot of depression to tell you the truth " he said a day earlier tears brimming in his eyes a worried mrs rodriguez said she feared her husband was suicidal soon afterwards the couple had vacated their home
