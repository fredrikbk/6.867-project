years has made headlines for his hurricane katrina related lawsuits against the insurance industry but lately things have been heating up in a case against him concerning charges of criminal contempt friday special prosecutors asked the judge to set a trial date and laid out some of the details of their case saying "the evidence will prove that scruggs put self interest above compliance with the

the third party to whom mr scruggs allegedly sent documents mississippi attorney general jim hood who was also pursuing katrina related litigation against the insurers mr scruggs has asked the court to dismiss the criminal contempt proceedings he argues among other things that the injunction contained an exception for discussing the documents with law enforcement he also says that two of the

alabama case involving former employees of an insurance adjuster hired by state farm insurance co to evaluate katrina claims the women photocopied documents that they thought contained evidence of misconduct by state farm and retained mr scruggs to act as their lawyer the insurance adjuster then sued the women alleging they violated their employment agreements and stole trade secrets in december a judge ordered that all documents be returned to the adjusters counsel in june he ruled that mr scruggs "willfully violated" the december injunction by sharing the documents with mr hood

kirkland &amp ellis llp who said an &# billion financing could be jeopardized were the hearing delayed mr cieri called weils reasons for requesting a delay "woefully inadequate" given the risk to the companys financing deal "the personal needs of a handful of professionals unfortunately must be balanced against the thousands of employees creditors and other parties in interest whose livelihoods

nobel in law every year since the nobel prize has been awarded for achievements in physics chemistry physiology or medicine literature and for peace an economics prize was added in this year al gore a law school dropout shared in the peace prize but alas there is still no nobel prize in law should a law prize exist one reader of this blog was behind the idea of a nobel in law to "promote the idea of achieving peace through alternatives to violence " but most others were against the notion wrote one "the peace and economics prizes are enough for the soft sciences " others balked at granting such an award to legal practitioners "lawyers do not command the respect that physicists chemists and doctors do nor should they " wrote one "although lawyers are important to society so are custodians and plumbers and it seems silly to give a nobel prize for every job on earth " wrote another tongue presumably planted firmly in cheek "yes but who would handle the appeals from all the losers " al gores status as a law school dropout he left vanderbilt university law school to run for congress inspired this blog to ask readers about other famous law school dropouts it turns out
