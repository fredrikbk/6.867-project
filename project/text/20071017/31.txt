business ebays founder bets on participatory media pierre omidyar the founder of ebay inc is getting interested in the media world a generation ago he might have acquired a newspaper taken a stake in a cable operator or made some other splashy investment befitting a man with a net worth topping &# billion but mr omidyar doesnt have much use for that time honored route in fact no one in silicon valley does people who grew rich in the internet age believe that the best media opportunities involve new ways to attract millions of users at low cost with only light guidance from a small team at headquarters their reasoning deserves a close look the obvious champions of this approach are upstarts like google inc founders larry page and sergey brin or facebook founder mark zuckerberg googles &# billion market capitalization is public facebooks negotiations to sell a stake at what might be a &# billion valuation are being chattered about constantly in those cases the sheer size of those new media fortunes comes across as a triumphant roar mr omidyar is no shouter at age he has been retired from day to day duties at ebay for years though he remains chairman of the online auction company he lives in henderson nev where taxes are lower weve chatted intermittently since and its always mind stretching mr omidyar may be a low key engineer but he likes to defy tradition if he sees a compelling opportunity in recent interviews mr omidyar and his new investment chief matt bannick explained why they want to build "participatory media" companies in which vast numbers of ordinary citizens call the shots to them thats the future of media even if it wont always be profitable both men say their perspective is shaped hugely by their time at ebay mr bannick a former mckinsey &amp co consultant was ebay employee no he ran ebay motors and various other operations for eight years not only was ebay a great business success mr omidyar says "it also created all these social benefits by connecting people with shared interests that led us to think how can we find other opportunities to do the same thing " after a slow start mr omidyars main investment vehicle omidyar network has put money into a wide array of web based communities it has backed digg inc which lets ordinary users play editor and highlight the news stories they find most interesting it helped fund linden lab creators of the wildly popular second life simulated world another omidyar network funded venture federated media publishing inc sells ads for bloggers making thousands of them more economically viable mr bannick the managing partner of omidyar wants the group to take more board seats and make bigger investments in companies it finds intriguing he and his staff aim to make or at least seriously consider to investments in participatory media over the next year which would more than double that part of their portfolio to some degree messrs omidyar and bannick have never met a web user community they didnt like leaving aside a few nightmare scenarios it hardly matters to them what content people are creating or swapping as long as theres interaction going on the mass appeal of these sites delights them along with the sense that they are making media access more democratic than its ever been "at a very fundamental level the internet gives ordinary people a global voice " mr omidyar explains its becoming easier and cheaper to create such companies content management software used to cost &# million or more acceptable versions now are free computer server and storage costs have plummeted there havent been comparable breakthroughs in old media costs to be sure even the popular media companies that omidyar network helps create may seem flimsy digg last month got million unique visitors according to comscore inc and far more by other tallies that digg prefers with just employees by contrast many major news organizations employ thousands without getting that much web traffic diggs content consists of repackaged stories from elsewhere no matter its users ability to vault stories to prominence and consign others to obscurity defines one of the simplest most profitable media specialties by contrast in mr omidyars world it may not be possible anymore to turn a profit from old fashioned news gathering as a philanthropic gesture he is helping fund the sunlight foundation which seeks fuller disclosure of government documents the omidyar network also is funding some nonprofit media enterprises such as common sense media inc which invites users to rate movies videogames and the like for family suitability mr omidyar says he still likes some traditional news outlets such as the economist wsj com the online edition of the wall street journal and bbc podcasts he thinks there may be ways to partner his types of interests with old media companies mr bannick isnt so sure "its really tough for the incumbents to make decisions that are as decisive as they need to be theyve got models that worked for years its really hard to cannibalize yourself we saw this a lot when ebay was getting rolling " corrections &amp amplifications matt bannick the managing partner of omidyar network previously worked as head of ebay inc s international and paypal units wednesdays business column incorrectly said he had headed ebay motors wsj oct
