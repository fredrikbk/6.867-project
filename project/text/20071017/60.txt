ethanols water shortage if the senates new "renewable fuels" mandate becomes law get ready for a giant slurping sound as midwest water supplies are siphoned off to slake big ethanol house and senate negotiators are preparing for an energy bill conference and if the senates language prevails americas economy will be forced to consume more than five times current ethanol production heavily subsidized and absurdly inefficient corn based ethanol has already driven up food prices but the senates plan to increase production to billion gallons by from less than seven billion today will place even greater pressure on farm belt aquifers ethanol plants consume roughly four gallons of water to produce each gallon of fuel but thats only a fraction of ethanols total water habit cornell ecology professor david pimentel says that when you count the water needed to grow the corn one gallon of ethanol requires a staggering gallons of ho backers of the senate bill say that less thirsty technologies are just around the corner which is what weve been hearing for years some corn producing regions are already scrapping over dwindling supply the journals joe barrett recently reported that kansas is threatening to sue neighboring nebraska for consuming more than its share of the republican river the grand forks herald reports local opposition to a proposed ethanol plant in erskine minnesota with anti refinery yard signs sprouting up and residents concerned about well water backers of a proposed plant in jamestown north dakota recently withdrew their application when it became clear that the plants million gallon a day appetite would drain too much from a local aquifer in wisconsin new ethanol plants are encountering opposition in sparta and milton "there are going to be conflicts " says iowa state hydrogeologist bill simpkins "and there are going to be lawsuits " even in iowa which enjoys abundant rainfall there are no guarantees that supply can meet the new demand "the problem is we dont know enough about some of these areas to say whether people can pump out a lot more water " mr simpkins says the political fights could get ugly because plants tend to pop up near cities not necessarily near the biggest water supplies ethanol needs a rail system to be distributed and ethanol factories save money on boiler maintenance when they get the same kind of high quality water that humans prefer in states like iowa where ethanol plants are considered agricultural projects deserving of preferential treatment ethanol can also muscle out other business uses ethanols big environmental footprint is not limited to water because biofuels like ethanol are highly inefficient in september the chairman of the oecds roundtable on sustainable development released a report entitled "biofuels is the cure worse than the disease " authors richard doornbosch and ronald steenblik compared the power density of different energy sources measured in energy production per unit of the earths area oil because it requires only a narrow hole in the earth and is extracted as a highly concentrated form of energy is up to times more efficient than solar energy which requires large panels collecting a less concentrated form of energy known as the midday sun but even solar power is roughly times as efficient as biomass derived fuels like ethanol in other words growing the corn to produce ethanol means clearing land and killing animals on a massive scale or converting land from food production to fuel production peter huber of the manhattan institute says that the best case scenario promoted by ethanol cheerleaders will actually cause the greatest environmental disaster if people can actually refine cheap low maintenance production techniques that dont require huge water supplies mr huber predicts a world wide leveling of forestland as farmers turn vegetation into fuel writing in science magazine renton righelato and dominick spracklen estimate that in order to replace just of gasoline and diesel consumption the u s would need to convert a full of its cropland to ethanol production the alternative approach clearing wilderness would mean more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than simply sticking with gasoline because the co munching trees cut down to make way for king ethanol absorb more emissions than ethanol saves slowly but surely these problems are beginning to alert public opinion to the huge costs of force feeding corn ethanol as an energy savior the ethanol lobby is still hoping it can keep all of this under wraps long enough to shove one more big mandate through congress but the members need to know the problems theyll be creating we hope that house conferees who did not include a new mandate in their energy bill insist that any final bill is ethanol free see related letters "letters to the editor ethanol plenty of corn and plenty of water" wsj oct
