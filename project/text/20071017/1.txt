a question for mr mukasey when he appears before the senate judiciary committee today as the nominee to become the nations st attorney general michael mukasey will be peppered with questions about recent events and perceived dysfunction at the justice department however not all of the departments problems can fairly be laid at the feet of current or recent officials one of the departments most destructive practices compelling waiver of the attorney client privilege from organizations under investigation traces its roots to the waning days of the clinton administration in then deputy attorney general eric holder issued guidelines spelling out nine factors to consider when pressing charges against corporations one factor the corporations willingness to cooperate was defined to include the corporations "willingness to cooperate in the investigation of its agents including if necessary the waiver of the corporate attorney client and work product protection " under president george w bush the scandals at enron tyco and worldcom led the department through former deputy attorney general larry thompson to expand the so called holder memorandum and make it binding on all federal prosecutors suddenly the cooperation language became a less than subtle mandate to corporations under investigation show us what you discussed with your lawyers or face an indictment that could destroy your business seeking a waiver of this privilege flies in the face of two fundamental principles the obligation of the state to prove its case and the constitutional right to counsel in my days as the philadelphia district attorney i would never have considered asking for such a waiver implicitly or explicitly to prove the states case although the department tried to ameliorate its policy in the form of a memo last december issued by deputy attorney general paul mcnulty that attempt amounted to a swing and a miss critics derided the mcnulty memo as "too little too late " the american bar association wrote that the memo fell "far short of what is needed to prevent further erosion of fundamental attorney client privilege work product and employee protections during government investigations " the department should not merely rewrite its policies on attorney client privilege waiver it should replace them with a clear prohibition honoring the time honored common law privilege i will ask mr mukasey a former federal judge for the southern district of new york in manhattan what he will do to end the justice departments practice of seeking waiver of the attorney client privilege from organizations under investigation i expect an answer showing an experienced judges understanding of and respect for the attorney client relationship as one would anticipate from a judge with a long tenure on the bench mr mukasey is hardly a blank slate on the matter in united states v su judge mukasey signaled he is not amenable to airing attorney client communications in federal criminal cases in su a defendant was interrogated after invoking his right to counsel the defendant spoke to his counsel via telephone but was then interrogated further in fighting the interrogations legality the defendants counsel was called to testify about what he discussed with his client judge mukaseys opinion frowned on this airing of attorney client communications "the possibilities for damage to an ongoing attorney client relationship from such testimony and of real prejudice to the client are apparent and are to be avoided " mr mukaseys concerns with respect to an individuals right apply with equal force in the corporate context when the supreme court confirmed the availability of an attorney client privilege for corporations in its upjohn decision it stated the privileges "purpose is to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys and their clients and thereby to promote broader public interests in the observance of law " in the corporate context this attorney client dialogue is especially necessary to ensure that corporate conduct is informed and that executives identify and stop problems before they rise to the level of a front page headline since the last congress i have worked to bring reason to the justice departments corporate charging policy and to end the practice of privilege waiver demands through these efforts i have heard from a broad coalition of organizations and former justice officials including the chamber of commerce the american bar association the american civil liberties union the national association of manufacturers former attorneys general ed meese and richard thornburgh and former solicitors general ken starr seth waxman walter dellinger and ted olson who have urged immediate reform and pointed out the unintended negative consequences the departments policy has on internal corporate investigations in response to these concerns i drafted the attorney client privilege protection act to forbid privilege waivers except in those cases where organizations do so voluntarily and without a request or demand from prosecutors in the absence of prompt action from the department to repeal its policies i hope my bill will move quickly through congress the house judiciary committee has already unanimously voted out an identical bill although he will only have a little more than a year to steer the justice department mr mukasey will still have a meaningful opportunity to leave his imprint on the department and to improve its functioning he should take advantage of this opportunity to end the departments practice of compelling waiver of the attorney client privilege mr specter is a republican senator from pennsylvania
