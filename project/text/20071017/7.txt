an intimate exhibition that rewards the keen eye camille pissarro impressions of city and country jewish museum through feb new york camille pissarro was the linchpin of the french painting avant garde from the s until his death and revered in his time paul cezanne called him "colossal" and said that "we are all derived from pissarro " vincent van gogh declared him "the father of us all " in the th century pissarro was obscured by his protege cezanne whose work was seen as the underpinning of modern painting but an essentially reductivist art followed from cezanne mining fundamental veins but ending in a played out minimalism pissarros art on the other hand is the more inclusive full and complete for example cezannes emphasis on paintstrokes on the canvas surface keeps your attention there pissarro invites you in pissarro traditionally was known as a great landscapist a translator of nature into art but this nature was not limited to what was arrayed in front of him nor even to the nature of the artist pissarro discovered a new subject central to art the nature of the medium itself he showed that all of paintings basic qualities colors brushstrokes materiality lines shapes composition were meaningful in their own right and in their potential to transform paint into purely visual poetry as well as into illusionistic pictures he was in essence the first abstract artist throughout most of the th century pissarros significance remained almost underground but clues surfaced from time to time alfred werner the viennese american art critic wrote in commentary in that pissarro was "the least compromising of the impressionists " clive bell the influential english art theorist of bloomsbury vintage was "tempted to rank him with the very greatest artists " barnett newman an artist central to post world war ii american artists pursuit of purely visual expression considered pissarro his favorite artist since several major exhibitions have revealed pissarros large role in the history of art the unsurpassed quality of his work and his far reaching modernity "camille pissarro impressions of city and country " at the jewish museum here is modest in scope with about works yet blockbusters are not essential pissarros oeuvre is one continuous painting project as much as it is a series of distinct works this part of his modernity is emphasized by the shows curator karen levitov when she notes in the museums news release that "pissarros continual artistic experimentation revolutionized late nineteenth century art " as early as "sous bois " an chalk on paper abstraction dominates the composition the light and dark verticals against a background of rough organic shapes in varied techniques comes across before the scene itself does broad geometries are emphasized in "houses at lhermitage pontoise" expressive colorful brushwork is set against a linear construction in "the brook at montbuisson" "the climbing path" offers one of the most wildly complex compositions youll find in new york "the chateau de busagny osny" portrays the scent of crisp winter air stay awhile and feel a direct conduit between art and spirit maybe you are conveyed by the zen like endless attentiveness of pissarros brush touching the surface in so many ways its a mysterious painting with great presence paintings of an flood are so utterly modern and fresh they could have been painted yesterday color fields are delicately divided into paintstroke clusters smaller against larger strokes differentiated by color direction scale and fluidity varying pressures of the brush and fine distinctions of intense color reward the keen eye the briefest calligraphies poise against color rippling with daring smears the shows intimacy is part of its draw pissarro had no need to shout and his greatness can be discerned perhaps can only be discerned in the time you must spend trying to fathom one of his paintings his art exists in an unusually demanding highly rewarding sphere it orchestrates time as well as space in pure form as you move through a work and ponder the wealth of abstract events and sensuous qualities the depictions the many types of space and the interplay among these elements and while there is much to be gotten from a normal viewing distance you must spend some of this time up close often many different types of form are combined an essay of lines a pattern of organic shapes an arrangement of geometric forms the technique can be lush dry heavy light and even closer each individual brushstroke dab or smear of paint is a note in both a local composition and in the overall symphony thus extraordinarily pissarro brings you into the painting and then addresses you directly in a true visual dialogue this intimate direct contact with the artists thought process via his minute dextrous painterly notation is a real time real experience not a description not a narrative and certainly not virtual pissarro achieves this very modern interaction without abandoning other artistic qualities validated over many centuries pissarros legendary empathy is carried by this language of form which is how his work can have such full human feeling without being sentimental or resorting to a singular cutting expressionism or "transgression " the humanity and the formal genius raise each other pissarro the individualist was interested in anarchism this much is true but it has led some commentators on art including the curator of the show in her wall texts and the catalog essay to flights of fancy they shanghai the artist into the political camp depicting him as the creator of a narrative rather than a visual art "for pissarro " the catalog tells us "the work of painting was closely tied to his anarchist leanings embodied in the radicalism of his technique " but in reality pissarro was adamantly against narrative sentimentalism in art and knew very well that politics in art is a form of this he kept it out of his work we are told too that pissarro lived in the countryside and painted figures embedded in landscape because of his socialist alliance with the peasant but in fact pissarro lived outside of paris because he needed a place where he could afford to raise his family as a painter of landscapes he needed easy proximity to landscapes his figures were embedded in a field of colored brushstrokes as part of an overall abstract painting technique and is every woman for they are mostly women in a field or garden or market a "peasant" and then there is the catalogs assertion that the "technical innovations he pursued went against the established conventions of painting of the time and are thus connected with pissarros overall anti establishment philosophy " surely edgar degas and edouard manet were also innovators in technique but they were the very embodiment of the establishment if you dont read the wall texts or catalog you can be moved overwhelmingly by pissarros feeling intelligence and inventive dexterity of expression the thrill of beauty and of great art if you focus instead on the boilerplate you risk being dragged down into the post modern morass that reduces the artist to a pawn and painting to propaganda mr gordon is a writer and visual artist based in new york his writing has been published in commentary and the new york sun
