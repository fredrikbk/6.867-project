the putin touch vladimir putin paid mahmoud ahmadinejad a visit yesterday the first russian leader to hit tehran since joseph stalin in but lets not get too carried away by the comparison more telling was the contrast in both substance and atmospherics between the russian presidents meeting with his iranian counterpart and his talks this past weekend with the u s secretaries of state and defense in iran mr putin pledged that he would not "renounce our obligations" regarding a nuclear power plant russia is building in the iranian port city of bushehr he insisted that irans "main objectives" in seeking nuclear technology "are peaceful " and he underscored russias burgeoning economic ties with the islamic republic which "has already reached &# billion " anyone harboring illusions that russia can be brought aboard for a tougher round of u n sanctions against iran might want to read these statements twice similarly anyone who thought russia could be won over to the deployment of a limited u s missile defense system in poland and the czech republic should have paid closer attention to mr putins message to condoleezza rice and bob gates "of course we can some time in the future decide that some antimissile defense should be established somewhere on the moon " said mr putin with more sarcasm than wit he offered this observation after keeping his american guests cooling their heels for minutes a tactic that recalls the habits of the late syrian strongman hafez assad mr putins claim that the deployment of interceptors poses a threat to his countrys nuclear deterrence is almost as preposterous as his claim that irans nuclear program poses no threat or rather it would be preposterous if his opposition to this modest u s defense initiative wasnt mr putins entire point in his smiles yesterday with mr ahmadinejad as in his scowling at ms rice and mr gates one sees the future of russian foreign policy and it is beginning to look a lot like its th century past
