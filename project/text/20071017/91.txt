just how far behind is linux depends on where you start if some of linus torvaldss own family members back in finland dont use linux what hope is there for the rest of us linux the free operating system whose development is overseen by mr torvalds has long been entrenched in the worlds of science and commerce when google gives you a search result a linux machine is doing the work at tens of thousands of other companies computer managers take comfort in the fact that these days no one ever gets fired for "buying" open source but world domination thats another story even though linux is easier than ever to use the dream of many linux buffs of it replacing windows as the desktop mainstay is at best stalled at worst fading while exact numbers are hard to come by one survey has desktop linux users barely scraping a single percentage point of the market share among microsoft customers concedes mr torvalds are his father and sister though mom has managed to resist the allure of the dark side so with the top version of windows vista running at nearly &# at least for new users why do people continue to open their wallets wide when theres a free alternative one reason is that for most consumers windows is "free " coming as it does with their new pcs computer companies hardly seem interested in offering alternatives h p for example ships more pcs than anyone but wont sell a computer without windows at least in the u s dell is far more linux friendly and offers a line of consumer linux machines that run &# less than their windows counterparts but dell doesnt exactly broadcast the option theres no mention of it on its home page and you need to know to click on an "open source computers" link on an inside page of its web site before you know of the alternative dell started installing linux earlier in the year after a suggestion box on its web site drew a deluge of requests for the system dell doesnt say how many linux pcs it ships but one survey puts it at a tiny fraction of total units and tellingly far more people requested that dell sell linux than actually bought a machine once it went on sale that suggests the typical consumer user has none of the philosophical objections to windows of some members of the open source community windows works well enough that the difficulty involved in switching operating systems outweighs any slings and arrows of using it linux developers though remain determined to eliminate that difficulty the best example of their efforts is a linux "distribution" known as ubuntu a zulu xhosa word for "human ness " more than anything else ubuntu has come closest in making linux ready for prime time ubuntus most prominent backer is mark shuttleworth a year old south african who made a bundle in when he sold his security firm to verisign he used some of those proceeds to become the first african in space as a for pay tourist in on a russian space mission he regards his work with ubuntu as partly a philanthropic endeavor because of its use in developing countries where loaded computers are hard to come by ubuntus claim to fame is that its developers have bundled not just linux but a shelf full of other important programs such as web browsers and word processors into a single easy to install package once on your computer it looks and acts much as windows does whats more ubuntu updates itself every six months and notifies you if security updates are needed in the interim that last feature incidentally should disabuse an actual ubuntu user of the notion that a non windows operating systems is security utopia where hackers are powerless and children are all above average i recently installed the april version of ubuntu on my home machine and promptly was informed that more than security patches to problems discovered in the interim awaited my downloading who does ubuntu think it is windows everything about ubuntu worked as billed but dont take my word for it test drive it yourself at ubuntu com developers have created a mode that lets you experiment with the software without permanently installing it on your pc you also can load ubuntu into its own hard disk partition using a built in dual boot program although if you have to ask what that means you probably shouldnt try it mr shuttleworth says linux ubuntu has become so easy that anyone anywhere can use it as a primary operating system as long as they have a technically savvy friend to help with rough patches and that gap too hes determined to close he says mr torvalds isnt involved with ubuntu that isnt the way linux works he agrees that increasing the desktop presence of linux is a crucial long term goal largely because thats how new programmers get interested in the software which keeps the wheel turning he still believes that ultimately the race for dominance will go to the slow and steady "maybe the desktop isnt exactly getting conquered but its getting a fair amount of development attention " he says "im a technical guy so i tend to believe in the if you build it they will come motto even if the inertia in the market would make it a long road to travel " email me at lee gomes wsj com
