politics &amp economics giuliani connects with morals voters on security hard line stances play well with base of republican party washington republican presidential front runner rudy giuliani is finding that tough foreign policy stands are helping him connect with social and religious conservatives constituencies where the former new york city mayors support has been seen as weakest those conservatives a bedrock of the partys base in recent elections are unhappy with mr giulianis positions in support of abortion and gay rights as well as his two divorces but mr giulianis positioning himself as a tough leader in the fight against islamist extremism and threats from iran and his staunch support for israel have kept many social conservatives in his corner despite their misgivings about his stands on domestic issues "i think that a lot of evangelical voters see abortion as a moral issue but a lot of them also see defending western civilization against this enemy as a moral issue " says gary bauer a religious conservative activist and republican presidential hopeful "where the jury is out is once the voters understand where giuliani is on both of those things will the war still trump those social issues " strong backing of israel in particular is important to some religious conservatives who have developed their own close bonds to the jewish state and its oversight of biblical lands this support was on display yesterday when the candidate told a republican jewish coalition gathering here that as president he would be deeply suspicious of land for peace talks with the palestinians he said neither americans nor israelis should negotiate with militant islamic leaders and organizations that he believes are committed to destroying western society he drew applause while recounting a episode when he ordered that the late palestinian leader yasser arafat be ejected from a concert for world leaders at lincoln center "the reason i did it was that i knew from my own investigations of arafat that he was a murderer and a terrorist " mr giuliani said "this whole idea of holding him on a morally equivalent plane to the prime minister of israel was a terrible terrible mistake " recent polls suggest that mr giulianis hard line positions are helping him make inroads with social and religious conservatives a wall street journal nbc news poll conducted late last month found that of people who identified themselves as evangelical christians had a "somewhat positive" impression of mr giuliani republican candidate fred thompson the former tennessee senator who has campaigned as a reagan style conservative registered a "very positive" impression among of evangelicals former massachusetts gov mitt romney whose mormon faith has raised concerns among some conservative christian voters made a "somewhat positive" impression with of those evangelicals polled mr giuliani may be playing a risky political game by identifying so closely with the personalities and policies promoted by president bushs administration polls show that the american population is increasingly disillusioned with the war in iraq and that there is little support for a military strike against iran mr giulianis hard line stance may succeed in helping him shore up support from the republican base but if he is nominated could undermine his prospects during the general election analysts say "surrounding yourself with these neoconservative voices isnt sustainable " said steven clemons of the new america foundation a centrist washington based policy institution the former mayor has taken perhaps the hardest line among the presidential candidates on iran he has repeatedly stated his willingness to use military force to prevent tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons and he has described irans leadership as an irrational force with whom negotiations are probably hopeless "we need to isolate the terror funding theocrats" in tehran mr giuliani told the republican jewish coalition "you have to stand up to dictators to tyrants and to terrorists" as "weakness invites attack " despite the bush administrations troubles in iraq mr giulianis campaign is recruiting from neoconservative think tanks and publications that lobbied the white house to launch the invasion mr giuliani has courted them as allies in the fight against islamist extremism say his aides last week mr giulianis team named david frum the former bush speechwriter as a senior foreign policy adviser mr frum helped coin the phrase "axis of evil" in describing the governments of iran iraq and north korea during president bushs state of the union speech mr giuliani will seek to woo more conservative christian voters when he speaks friday at the values voter summit in washington along with other major republican candidates michael m phillips contributed to this article
