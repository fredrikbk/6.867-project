helping motorola make the most of its razr brand questions for kenneth c keller jr company motorola inc title chief marketing officer kenneth c "casey" keller jr spent most of his career selling heinz ketchup and pringles chips until he was appointed as the chief marketing officer of motorola inc in october it was a challenging assignment mr keller had to fill big shoes left by his predecessor the late geoffrey frost whose creation of the popular "hello moto" ad campaign injected pizzazz into the stale motorola brand mr frost died in late whats more the cellphone business is extremely competitive and subject to the fickleness of consumer tastes that was highlighted for mr keller shortly after he arrived when motorolas handset business took a nose dive the business had thrived on the success of the top selling razr phone but motorola was caught flat footed as consumer tastes shifted away from the razr mr kellers solution "franchise" the razr phone by using the brand for mid to low end slim phones one of motorolas new phones is named the razr for instance mr keller a competitive tennis player and a former u s navy officer talks below about the differences between selling ketchup and cellphones and how motorola plans to boost its digital ad spending he also explains why he went ahead with a controversial tv commercial in which two dressed for success subway commuters one male one female slice each others clothes off partly with super sharp razr phones the wall street journal what are the differences between selling ketchup and cellphones mr keller the product and technology life cycle of cellphones is much faster on ketchup you might have a breakthrough in tomato technology sweetener technology that might come along every one to two years in this industry the products and the basic feature capabilities the performance of technology is changing every three months the consumer purchase processes are quite different in mobile devices to of people research the phone online before they walk into a store and purchase it that doesnt happen on ketchup wsj where do you spend most of your ad dollars how is this mix likely to change in the next year mr keller the two places of our budgets that are really growing are one online because thats where people get information two retail digital or online efforts now represent somewhere between and of our total spend that has been increasing dramatically over the past three to four years and may increase to greater than in the next couple of years were also focused on retail we know although people do a lot of research about their product purchase online they also make a lot of final decisions on retail when they touch and feel the products television radio and outdoor have been decreasing print as a targeted vehicle has remained about flat wsj does motorola spend any ad dollars on mobile advertising mr keller we have but to be honest its not big spending its mostly experiments because the ecosystem for mobile advertising has not been fully developed in most of the world yet in the u s we dont necessarily have the access to the cellphone numbers the operators do not share that information for us to do direct efforts its not always possible in the future that could become an important advertising vehicle for us weve been doing a lot of research on that within motorola we have a technology that allows us to search the text messages to understand not only where that person might be but also to be able to search the text to understand what their interests might be wsj have you ever considered abandoning the razr name some people say that consumers are tired of it its no longer cool mr keller some people do say that to me theres a segment of consumer population out there that wants the latest the greatest but there are the majority of people out there who want to stick with a phone that works they want the product to be updated to provide the latest features and performance if they can trust and rely on the razr to deliver that core quality performance design and things theyre looking for theyre very happy to stick with it to me the razr name is incredibly valuable its not a fad its not fleeting its something thats more enduring there were over million people who bought razr in the last three years we have an incredible amount of brand awareness and recognition the challenge to me is to keep the razr products fresh consistent with the identity image we created wsj the razr commercial was quite polarizing even inside motorola what message did you want to communicate to consumers what made it controversial mr keller in the razr commercial what we were trying to communicate is that the product is sharper in terms of looks finish and materials we dramatize it in a unique way that you can only associate with the razr we knew that it was polarizing it appeals very strongly to men it doesnt work as well on women but that message still gets across to the women even though they dont like the drama of knife fight in a subway as much to me thats the most important our target audience on razr is slightly more male probably to male to female so the fact that we have a commercial thats polarizing was not a big concern because of the nature of our target audience candidly being polarizing has some benefits being polarizing got you talked about recognized and remembered what we want to make sure of is it doesnt distract or detract from our message about what were promising in a product all of our researches show it didnt wsj how does it complicate motorolas marketing that in the u s consumers choice of phone is determined by the carrier they have how do you make sure people will buy motorola phones mr keller even though this is a market where the carriers are making a lot of decisions we try to influence the consumers ive been trying to drive some of our customer relationships in the u s with the verizons and the at&amp ts to a more common ground perspective we have a common objective which is how we can sell more phones were having a dialogue with carriers on how we see the market how we segment the market where we see the growth in the market where we see the opportunity where we see consumer segments that we can meet uniquely in addition to influencing carrier decisions we have to create a consumer pool in the marketplace for our products which also influences what the carriers need to take and carry and distribute and put in retail wsj the u s is the biggest market for motorola do you spend more ad dollars here mr keller i dont want to release specific country spending levels we have markets around the world where we really focus on our spending because thats where we have the most opportunity we spend a fair amount in the u s but to be honest we probably spend even more on a per phone basis in china because it operates more as a retail market more of our efforts there are direct to consumer because people are making their choices in retail versus in the u s where the carriers make decisions about what line they carry the spending in the u s is going up this year the spending in some of our other marketing is also increasing wsj are you consolidating motorolas ad account under ogilvy &amp mather mr keller weve consolidated our business to business marketing agency under bbdo they handle all of our product line in bb space including digital video networks equipment connected home enterprise etc on the business to consumer side including mobile devices business were in a process of getting to a longer term partnership structure right now wpp groups ogilvy &amp mather does all our work in latin america and asia we have been using them in the last several months in north america so if ogilvy &amp mather turned out to be our global agency of record for our network that would be great but we still need real good creative stimulus from several different creative teams some are o&amp m maybe some from other couple of agencies that we developed relationships with our network decision will be made in the next to days but were not to the point were making the final decision yet on exactly which agencies were going to use wsj your predecessor the late geoffrey frost was considered a marketing genius and it took motorola a year to find you to fill in his position after his sudden death have you found it intimidating mr keller hes a legend i dont think i would be at motorola if geoffrey hadnt started some of things he did i dont worry about comparing myself to geoffrey people tell me all the time "youre so different from geoffrey " i dont think about comparing myself im doing different work than geoffrey did my thrust is to get people to understand that well become a marketing organization become more consumer more customer driven thats what i want my legacy to be
