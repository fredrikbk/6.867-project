medtronic and fda face scrutiny on safety issues medtronic inc s decision to stop selling potentially defective defibrillator leads has prompted scrutiny of the devices and of how safety concerns about them were handled by the company and the food and drug administration plaintiffs attorneys a consumer group and iowa sen chuck grassley are examining the history of the sprint fidelis leads which are electrical wires that connect the hearts of patients to the defibrillators implanted in their chests on monday minneapolis based medtronic disclosed that the sprint fidelis wires have fractured in about of the models made of which are still implanted in people the company said the fractures may have contributed to five deaths in early signs of the pressure likely to come for medtronic and the fda mr grassley a republican last night sent letters to the company and the agency asking for more information about the leads separately consumer group public citizen argued in a letter that the company and agency should have taken action sooner in addition a group of plaintiffs attorneys which has been a leader in major heart device lawsuits filed suits against medtronic related to the sprint fidelis leads in federal court in minneapolis and puerto rico according to hunter shkolnik one of the lawyers the investigations are likely to again focus attention on the fdas oversight of medical devices which are regulated under different standards than drugs for instance the sprint fidelis leads which went on the u s market in werent required to be tested in humans before they won fda approval previous versions were tested in humans but the sprint fidelis models werent different enough from those earlier iterations to require human trials the fda said medtronic says it did start clinical trials for two of the four sprint fidelis models before they were sold in the u s one in patients and the other in patients but didnt include these in its fda application because they werent required the devices "passed the objectives of the study " which wasnt designed to assess long term fracture risk a medtronic spokesman said medtronic said in a letter to physicians this march that its investigation suggested that "variables within the implant procedure may contribute significantly to these fractures " an issue that potentially would arise only when doctors actually placed the devices into humans before approving the sprint fidelis models the fda reviewed results from animal tests and extensive engineering "bench" studies including million repetitions of a bending motion designed to answer questions about the devices strength said megan moynahan chief of the fda branch that oversees defibrillator leads because the fracturing issue is "extraordinarily rare " a human clinical trial was unlikely to find it she said ms moynahan said the agency began watching the devices more closely in february but "the lead didnt appear to be performing any differently" than other similar products she said and there wasnt a clear signal of a problem "weve had this closely on our radar and our concern has been building " she said " medtronic said in a statement that when it "had the appropriate information to make a decision regarding the sprint fidelis defibrillation lead we did so with patient safety and well being as our primary concern "
