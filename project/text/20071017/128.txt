politics &amp economics in europe two moods on change germany wavers on cuts to benefits france gets serious an unexpected shift is happening in the heart of europe frances government is getting serious about economic overhaul while germanys politicians are getting cold feet about the painful changes they have undertaken in recent years in paris president nicolas sarkozys drive to reinvigorate the french economy faces its first serious test tomorrow as frances railway and power unions prepare a nationwide strike to protest cuts in their pension entitlements "we will bring france to a halt " said didier le reste head of the railway branch at the confederation generale du travail labor union despite this show of force the strike isnt expected to derail the governments plans as have past union led protests polls show that a majority of french people oppose the strike and support mr sarkozys economic plans as a way to boost the countrys poor growth "there is a change in the mindset of the french people have come to the conclusion that something has to be done " says eric chaney chief european economist at morgan stanley in paris in germany however public opinion has turned so strongly against market oriented changes that chancellor angela merkels governing coalition is debating whether to reverse past measures social democrats who under the previous chancellor gerhard schroeder alienated their traditional working class supporters by passing deep welfare cuts now want to raise benefits again for older unemployed people the social democrats junior partners in ms merkels coalition are split between cabinet ministers who want to defend mr schroeders legacy and members led by party chairman kurt beck who want to reach out to lost voters who view benefit cuts as unfairly penalizing weaker members of society ms merkels conservatives who already have retreated from free market policies that were a liability in the last election already back more generous benefits for older jobless people "politicians have taken note of a change in the public mood the voters have had enough of reforms now they want social justice whatever that means in practice " says eckart tuchtfeld an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt "it means there will be no more reforms until the next elections in and perhaps beyond " he says these parallel trends mark a turnaround from the past five years during which germany has painfully unwound parts of its welfare state and its tight regulation of the economy while german companies have pressured unions into accepting pay restraint and more flexible working practices french governments meanwhile have repeatedly backed away from changes in the face of union opposition and street demonstrations french companies havent raised their efficiency as aggressively as their german rivals and many smaller companies in particular are struggling against rising global competition the results are plain germany has made its economy competitive again and is gaining global market share amid solid economic growth and falling unemployment france has gone from being one of europes strongest economies to one of its problem cases germanys economic growth last year at outpaced frances expansion the first time since that the german economy has grown faster than the french according to the international monetary fund german unemployment has dropped from about in early to just less than now whereas french unemployment has been stuck at nearly in that time according to government figures a sense that france is being left behind in global economic competition helped mr sarkozy win election in may on a platform that included an unusually large number of proposals to make the economy more flexible and dynamic ranging from allowing easier layoffs by companies to fostering more competition among universities to improve academic standards "it is quite an astute tactic " said french economist michel godet a professor at the conservatoire national des arts et metiers "he has opened so many fronts that labor unions are lost and dont know which one to fight first " the german backlash against cuts to benefit entitlements was perhaps to be expected after several years of welfare overhaul it also shows what mr sarkozy could face further down the road if he presses ahead too quickly
