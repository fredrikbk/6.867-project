behind banks credit rescue fund with new united voice auditors stand ground on how to treat crunch this time the auditors dont seem to be backing down after losing public confidence over their failure to warn investors about scandals such as those at enron corp and worldcom inc accounting firms are taking a hard line when it comes to questions that have arisen from the credit crunch "theres no question in my mind that the auditors are doing a much better job " said lynn turner a former chief accountant at the securities and exchange commission who is often a critic of the firms "theyre also doing a much better job than they did during the days" of the savings and loan crisis in recent weeks the accounting firms operating through a new industry group have taken views at odds with at least some of their clients about the use of market prices for hard to trade securities and over how banks should deal with their exposure to losses in off balance sheet lending vehicles this has prompted financial firms to recognize losses in securities that they may have otherwise put down to short term disruptions in markets it also prompted at least in part moves by large banks and the treasury department to bail out structured investment vehicles or sivs which are special lending vehicles that banks keep off their books the firms unyielding stance has pleasantly surprised some longtime critics such as mr turner who add that auditors seem to have stood firm on proper yet unforgiving accounting treatments despite the severity of the problems gripping the markets the auditors group for instance said companies have to use market prices no matter how depressed they are and cant argue that they should be ignored because they represent a fire sale valuation that is in contrast to the accounting firms behavior during previous crises particularly during the technology stock boom when auditors often acted as partners with management and sometimes caved in to corporate demands for aggressive accounting positions the firms have also taken a new approach to thorny questions like those they have recently tackled issuing guidance through the newly formed center for audit quality the industry group was formed earlier this year and has emerged as the voice of the big four accounting firms the recent positions on pricing hard to value securities and the treatment of off balance sheet lending vehicles were contained in three papers published by the center earlier this month that has allowed the accounting firms to speak with one voice helping prevent executives from playing auditors off one another or companies taking wildly differing approaches to complex questions "we can speak for the profession and theres strength in that " said cindy fornelli the centers executive director such unity can help especially when the markets are facing the kind of tough questions about valuation that have recently surfaced "investors would not be well served by different institutions thinking of these things very differently " said scott taub a partner at consulting firm financial reporting advisors llc and a former sec deputy chief accountant in spite of the praise there is unease over the role the center is playing in shaping and communicating the auditors positions the worry the center is taking on a role that should be played by regulators such as the sec or standard setters such as the financial accounting standards board while many accounting observers agree with the positions taken by the center during the current crisis they worry it represents a tentative first step on the road back to self regulation of the audit profession "they are usurping the roles of the fasb or sec " said joseph carcello director of research for the corporate governance center at the university of tennessee "why was this not guidance from the sec staff " such concerns have surfaced within fasb whose emerging issues task force usually deals with pressing issues "while no doubt well intentioned repeated efforts like this contribute to overall complexity in our financial reporting system and can sometimes serve to confuse rather than clarify the issue " said gerard carney a spokesman for the board the sec hasnt "endorsed or approved" the centers papers officials said sec chief accountant conrad hewitt said "auditing firms are the first line of defense " in terms of how standards are applied he added that management corporate audit committees and auditors should work to ensure that accounting standards are being implemented appropriately "we dont need the fasb or sec to step in to provide detailed applications guidance at every jog in the road " said james kroeker sec deputy chief accountant mr kroeker added that he discussed with some of the big accounting firms some of the issues that later were addressed in the centers papers but that the commission hadnt asked the group to draft any guidance he said that such discussions are routine for its part the center said it was simply trying to get information to the market about pressing issues as quickly as possible when the papers were drafted companies were nearing the close of their third quarters ms fornelli said the papers "were not forging new ground" in terms of accounting standards "it was a reminder of what the current literature stated at an important time and at a time that the marketplace needed reminding " she said see related article "heard on the street wachovia will chip in toward &# billion aim whos hanging back " wsj oct see related letter "letters to
