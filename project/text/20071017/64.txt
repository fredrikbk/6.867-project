right pedigree for an investment "i didnt have the right degree i didnt work for five years at cisco and oracle then start up three companies " said mr golan who previously founded a small software development and consulting firm "the reality is that vcs invest in people first second and third then the technology " undeterred mr golan operated out of his garage in costa mesa calif for three

round of between &# million and &# million momentum is one of several firms that have cropped up in recent years to fill a funding void left by vc firms shifting their investments downstream and bypassing the traditional guy in a garage that shift left many unseasoned entrepreneurs such as mr golan to fend for themselves in bringing intelligent ideas to fruition but it is also opening up an opportunity for smaller firms willing to take on higher risk and lend more credibility than do traditional angels "if youre an entrepreneur seed and series a deals are really tough to get right now " said beau laskey a managing director at burbank calif early stage firm steamboat ventures "venture firms are looking for customers and traction " los angeles based momentum has a distinctive model

attract customers yet they cant raise the money unless they have those pieces in place " typically a momentum partner works with two companies at a time spending half of his time on each with an operating associate subbing as a project manager and director of operations momentums ultimate goal is to deliver the company to venture capitalists and secure that first round of capital when the firms bridge investment converts often at a discount into series a preferred stock it is at this point the firm gets paid for its work after having deferred the majority of its management fees during the previous nine months longtime venture capitalist lou volpe a managing general partner at waltham mass based kodiak venture partners believes momentums model is unique and would consider investing in a start up seeded this way but questions the firms scalability "whipping a company into shape enforcing operating discipline and building an executive team takes a lot of energy and time " mr volpe said "these guys are going to be limited with their scale " thus far the firm has taken all seven of its start ups to the series a level focusing on los angeles area technology companies that require less than &# million in funding to break even on a cash flow basis the seven have raised a total of &# million in series a funding from venture capitalists the firm had its first exit in when

coalitions but found them as unwieldy as investors "you have to make like presentations to guys and the only thing that qualifies them is money " mr golan said "its kind of like american idol you make the pitch move on to the next round and try to get people to agree on everything id rather take the risk on the credit card than have to deal with angels " klaus koch a kline hawkes investor who led the firms investment in sendio said a firm like momentum is especially beneficial to vcs because it is bringing only companies with proven business models and customers "momentum comes in and takes out the significant risk " mr koch said "theyre pitching us with all the information we need and cleaning up the legal issues they really understand what a vc wants and for a firm like us that manages &# million thats very valuable " write to scott austin at scott austin dowjones com
