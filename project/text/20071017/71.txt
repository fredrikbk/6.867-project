grant and lee and glass at the opera appomattox san francisco opera tomorrow saturday and oct san francisco an opera about the civil war and the american civil rights movement could easily be a baggy monster full of overwrought emotion and extraneous detail but miraculously "appomattox " with music by philip glass and a libretto by christopher hampton is nothing of the kind the opera commissioned by the san francisco opera and given its world premiere here this month is a remarkable balance of form and substance economical in its use of musical material and profoundly affecting mr glasss instantly recognizable style and mr hamptons pointed text create a dark indelible picture of the horror of war and even more tragically the impossibility of resolution and inevitability of conflict it is a stunning work and deserves to be seen far beyond its seven performances in san francisco mr glasss early operas the monumental works that include "einstein on the beach" and "satyagraha " are all abstraction for "appomattox " he has harnessed his accessible tonal repetitive language into a concrete story that has resonance far beyond its ostensible subject verdi wrote operas about historical tyrannies to comment on the tyrannies of his own time in "appomattox " the characters may be dressed in the clothing of but they speak for the present as well the opera which runs hours with intermission is set in the last days of the civil war leading up to the moment when general ulysses s grant and general robert e lee met in the virginia town of appomattox court house to negotiate the terms of surrender of lees army and thus the end of the civil war but it begins with the voices of the generals wives and mary todd lincoln lamenting the death and bloodshed of the previous four years "war is always sorrowful and this war the most sorrowful of all let this be the last time " they sing to a dragging accompaniment this sentiment is repeated as other women step forward to place small elaborately framed photographs of their dead husbands and sons at the front of the stage even when the scene changes to grant and abraham lincoln discussing the possibility of the wars end the musical atmosphere of exhaustion and desolation remains this pessimism pervades the piece yet it is done with remarkable subtlety little personal details about the characters grants migraine headaches and his horror of blood mrs lees pride give texture to the larger historical events plot scenes lee trying to persuade his wife and daughter to flee richmond va before it falls the two generals each in his own field headquarters sending messages back and forth in the slow cautious pursuit of surrender are brief and economical big chorus scenes start quietly and gain in power and momentum in act i the fleeing citizens of richmond sing a horrified chorus on a repeated syllable "ah" as their city explodes clearly there are no words for what is happening to them mr glass and mr hampton set up assertions only to contradict them a moment later mrs lee insists that the slaves will look back on their days of captivity as a "golden age" that scene is immediately followed by a union regiment of black soldiers singing a victory song and freed slaves singing "clap your hands " mr glass wrote new music to existing words for both a similar technique with the opposite message is used in act ii as grant and lee formally and courteously agree on the terms of surrender scenes of the messy future break in such as mrs lincolns premonition of her husbands assassination and the description of an slaughter of a black militia in louisiana even wilmer mcleans house the site of the surrender is torn to pieces by souvenir seekers a preview of reconstruction and the terrible conflicts to come most chilling of all is a civil rights march to montgomery ala set as a terrific chorus "the ballad of jimmie lee " the story of the murder of jimmie lee jackson the ballad written by mr hampton and mr glass sounds like a real song of the civil rights era since the civil war anthem "tenting tonight" had appeared in act i i thought for a moment that this was another example of adaptive reuse mr glass has set the text for maximum intelligibility yet the vocal lines are always engaging and sung with intention not just to get the plot across the large cast was very impressive dwayne croft captured lees nobility his dismissal of his troops is a beautiful humble moment while andrew shore made grant gruff yet thoughtful philip skinner gave a tour de force performance as edgar ray killen the ku klux klansman who ordered the killing of andrew goodman michael schwerner and james chaney in in mississippi old and wheelchair bound he unrepentantly relates his horrific deed in brutal matter of fact language as the three wives rhoslyn jones elza van den heever and heidi melton all adler fellows the san francisco operas young artists program displayed splendid acting and vocal skills ms melton in particular has a huge voice conductor dennis russell davies conveyed both the sweep and the details of mr glasss score memorable moments include the expressive use of piano and celeste and the groaning tuba that accompanies grants musings director robert woodruff and costume designer gabriel berry established the concreteness of the story with character interactions and precise period costumes meanwhile the set design by riccardo hernandez with evocative lighting design by christopher akerlind switches time periods and moves from the personal to the political by placing the action in three different volumes of space close to the proscenium in front of a wall on a platform in the middle of the stage and finally in the full volume of the stage in the richmond scene sculptures of bound horses are suspended from the flies symbolizing the wholesale destruction wrought by war in the epilogue the women again repeat the chorus about the sorrow of war but now with no assurance that this will be "the last time " it becomes a terrible lullaby on the repeated syllable "la " and the horses descend again this time clearly drenched in blood ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
