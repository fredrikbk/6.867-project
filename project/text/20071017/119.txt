north carolina based contractor with government security even with u s soldiers with several investigations under way u s officials are considering whether to turn blackwaters work over to another contractor while tightening the rules under which u s security contractors operate in iraq but finding a replacement could prove difficult blackwaters security work for the state department in baghdad is up for renewal in may and u s officials say it would take at least that long to arrange for another private contractor to take over even a new company would have to rely heavily on hires from blackwaters employee base of about in iraq hiring and training new guards all of whom must be americans with classified security clearance would otherwise take months blackwater part of prince group llc couldnt be reached for comment blackwater and two other u s security companies dyncorp international and triple canopy inc are working under a global contract with the state department that gives them a total of &# million a year to protect officials in countries like israel bosnia afghanistan and iraq iraq alone accounts for &# million kathleen hicks a former defense department official who is now a senior fellow at the center for strategic &amp international studies said that while the state department could break blackwaters contract before it runs out it would be easier to see it through to the end "regardless of who they pick theyre going to have to have much better oversight " she said besides providing security details for u s diplomats and other officials in iraq blackwater also supplies a fleet of helicopters and pilots u s officials said the "little bird" helicopters which are like those used by elite military units and can maneuver in tight confines like cities provide essential evacuation surveillance and transportation functions that neither the military nor other contractors can easily offer blackwaters helicopters have been known to fill in during crisis moments such as picking up the polish ambassador to iraq after he was injured in an ambush earlier this month blackwaters presidential airways affiliate owns the helicopters three of which have been destroyed this year even finding a replacement for its basic security services could prove tough the administration has dismissed suggestions to tap the state departments own diplomatic security bureau which has about trained specialists scattered at u s embassies and other outposts around the world hiring and training new diplomatic security agents takes at least a year mustering the numbers required for iraq u s officials said would be out of the question "theres just no way our system could handle trying to get hundreds of new people trained and sent to iraq " said a state department official "that would be a multiyear process " both the pentagon and the state department long ago ruled out using u s soldiers to guard the hundreds of american diplomats and officials in iraq even the defense department relies on private security for the u s army corps of engineers and others doing pentagon funded work in iraq an iraqi investigation of the sept killings found that a blackwater convoy didnt come under attack before it opened fire on civilians in nisour square some iraqi officials are demanding that the company be prosecuted under iraqi law and relatives of the dead filed a federal lawsuit against blackwater last week in a u s court blackwater has said its convoy was fired on the state department has three teams in iraq looking into the sept incident one group led by the agencys top management official patrick kennedy is formulating recommendations on whether the u s should stick with blackwater or find some other arrangement its findings are expected to be released in early november u s officials familiar with the internal debate over blackwater said it is possible that the kennedy team will determine that the company is too much of a liability and must be replaced "if the determination is that blackwater is the problem then we would have to find a way to phase them out " said the state department official some u s officials said the state department was likely to reach an agreement with the iraqi government either to keep blackwater or to replace it with dyncorp or triple canopy dyncorp has been a u s government contractor for decades and has experience working in dangerous areas for the state department it held the previous state department security contract and has done international police training as well as counternarcotics missions in afghanistan and colombia though it doesnt have a fleet of aircraft like blackwater does dyncorp has extensive experience working on aviation contracts for the government dyncorp declined to comment triple canopy is a much younger company formed in the company which also provides security for the defense department declined to comment any of the firms would likely face tighter oversight and more restrictive rules on how to respond to threats like car bombs the state department is looking at a range of new technologies including high end lasers that security guards could use to warn approaching drivers currently the security guards use an escalating scale of force from signs and hand signals to thrown water bottles and gunfire despite such steps questions are likely to grow among both the companies and security guards over whether the political and legal risks they face in iraq on top of the day to day dangers are worth it while security guards can earn hundreds of dollars a day many are likely to think twice because of the uncertainty of legal protections under iraqi law combined with growing scrutiny from u s lawmakers and watchdog groups according to the state department breakdown of spending globally blackwaters security work under the contract costs &# million annually while its aviation operations account for an additional &# million triple canopy has a smaller role under the contract with its work costing the government &# million a year dyncorps share tallies up to &# million
