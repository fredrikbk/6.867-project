risks of a turkish strike incursion into iraq may undercut u s end kurdish boom baghdad iraq should turks act on their threat to send troops into northern iraq it could complicate u s efforts to bolster baghdads central government and threaten the economic boom enjoyed by the autonomous iraqi kurdish region but any operation will also pose significant military challenges for the turkish troops themselves who will be sent into difficult terrain against a guerilla force that has operated from the region for years the turkish parliament is expected this week to authorize military strikes against kurdish separatist guerillas who attack turkey from hideouts in northern iraq the authorization wont necessarily lead to war but the rhetoric from turkish leaders facing domestic pressure to act has escalated to levels not seen in years that has triggered a renewed push by iraqi and u s officials to forestall an all out conflict according to some analysts turkey may be using the specter of an invasion to scare iraq and washington into reining in the fighters from the kurdistan workers party known by its kurdish acronym pkk the armed group fighting for kurdish autonomy within turkey is on washingtons list of terrorist organizations from a haven in iraqs kurdish north its guerillas routinely cross into turkey and kill soldiers and police the iraqi government called for emergency talks with turkey yesterday and sent a vice president to the turkish capital of ankara turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan while insisting turkey has the right to defend itself sought to dispel fears of an imminent attack "passage of this parliamentary motion does not mean an immediate incursion will follow " he said "but we will act at the right time and under the right conditions " an invasion would raise a host of messy issues for baghdad as it struggles to exert control amid bloody sectarian conflict across iraq it could also further destabilize the oil rich region as crude prices hit almost daily records in trading yesterday in new york crude oil futures finished at a record &# a barrel up &# or oil traders and analysts blamed much of the rise early this week on the turkish threats though any attack would have only limited impact on global oil supplies iraq ships some of its oil through a pipeline to the turkish port of ceyhan on the mediterranean an iraqi oil official says it is unlikely the line will be shut down in the case of a military attack in any case the pipeline has been repeatedly shut down by insurgent attacks on the iraq side and even on a good day throughput amounts to only some barrels of daily global demand any operation poses big risks for turkey too pkk guerillas numbering about according to western intelligence estimates live and train in the qandil mountain range a challenging battlefield for any invasion force they appear to have prepared for war by eschewing large installations in favor of small well hidden camps often reachable by a single narrow pass small nimble and familiar with the terrain the pkk stands a chance of holding off turkish troops forcing them into an extended presence or an embarrassing backdown "you can get bogged down in northern iraq " says cengiz candar a turkish political analyst who has followed the conflict closely while turkey has stressed that its fight is only with the pkk any perception of a turkish occupation could inflame age old tensions between turks and kurds risking a broader conflict although nominally part of iraq iraqi kurdistan operates as a de facto independent state and turkey fears its own large kurdish minority could seek similar autonomy some iraqi kurdish leaders including members of the enclaves security forces view the pkks goals as broadly compatible with those of the iraqi kurds autonomy from a larger ethnic group in a faraway capital iraqi kurdish leaders have publicly condemned pkk violence and have urged the group to pursue a cease fire with turkey but they have done nothing substantial to restrict the groups freedom of movement one kurdish official says the regions security forces are overwhelmed from guarding the border with the rest of iraq to prevent infiltration by sunni arab extremists a broader conflict with turkey could also hurt iraqi kurdistans economic renaissance as the most peaceful part of iraq the region has attracted investment and has recruited foreign firms to search for oil on its territory landlocked iraqi kurdistan depends on turkey for much of its imports when it is ready to ship oil to international markets it will need turkish pipelines turkey has launched limited strikes against the pkk before but never succeeded in dislodging the fighters militarily a turkish drumbeat for the invasion is partly the result of the internal politics of turkey funerals of turkish soldiers and police killed by the pkk receive blanket television coverage and stir public outrage at what turkey sees as a terrorist campaign ignored by its allies in washington and europe at the same time the u s house of representatives is set to vote on a bill labeling the killings of tens of thousands of armenians in turkey early last century as genocide the bill has enraged turks who say the killings occurred in a war that claimed many turkish lives too after the latest pkk attack left a dozen soldiers dead earlier this month the turkish government had to choose between asking for parliamentary approval and appearing weak to its citizens
