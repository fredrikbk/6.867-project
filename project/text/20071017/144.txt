one of the best shows youll ever see look at all these people waiting even though its free this takes a lot of your time its not just cheap its respect " hollywood as a rule doesnt put on public memorial services for departed greats yet for reasons cultural and actuarial they are hits on broadway "its about the postwar fantasy of optimism and love a golden moment in the theater " says lee mindel an architect who was a friend of ms comdens and of her partner in song adolph green but for that eras headliners its time to call it a day composer cy coleman spoke at mr greens memorial

house "the public wants people of prominence especially the entertainers the stars " says mr schoenfeld "and the more popular the deceased the better " a thousand fans were turned away from the seat majestic last spring at the finale for mrs hart who was in "a night at the opera" with groucho marx in married playwright moss hart dressed elegantly as a tv panelist on "to tell the truth " and had a

cuomo even barbara walters came " all summer ms greene kept an eye on the obituaries for this seasons potential playbill "i watch i listen " she says her obit habit started years ago after she lost a

" she says "billy crystal did the eulogy need i say more " still a funeral home is no place for a big show which is why ms greene was pleased to learn that the beverly sills gala goodbye in september would take place at the metropolitan opera it was a bright sunday and fans were lined up ahead of her thousands soon lined up behind her the first being rory bernard who is and it emerged after a long chat was distantly acquainted with a cousin of one of ms greenes bridge partners ms bernard unfolded an article with a recent photo of ms sills and said "she looks wonderful for her age " ms greene said "we were both born in " and not only that "we went to the same grammar school in brooklyn for two years beverly was my friend " "you knew beverly sills " said ms bernard "so what are we standing here for some friend " when the lights dimmed ms greene had a good seat in the dress circle but she didnt applaud after the mets general manager peter gelb spoke or placido domingo sang or carol burnett almost cried when henry kissinger recounting a last hospital visit to ms sills said "the nurse did not recognize me and thought i might be walter cronkite " ms greene murmured "funny " "im not a big clapper " she said afterward "it takes a lot to make me clap " at the betty comden sendoff a lot was what ms greene got outside the majestic show time was near limousines unloaded invited celebs stanley donen tommy tune someone shouted "celeste holm" and the crowd surged for a look when the doors opened ms greene said "run " she and ms gutman landed in the mezzanine in a minute lauren bacall was on stage saying "welcome to the theater " and from then on the betty comden tribute was all song and dance ms greene whispered "no speeches " thats how the producers wanted it "our goal was to do
