electricity demand is far outpacing new supply sources u s electricity demand is growing at twice the pace new supplies are being added an imbalance that if it persists could lead to supply problems in a couple of years an electric industry group said in its latest year forecast the north american electric reliability corp or nerc found supplies thinning fastest in california the rocky mountain region new england texas the midwest and the southwest nerc which oversees the reliability of bulk power systems in the u s and parts of canada said peak demand is expected to increase or about megawatts for the u s during the next decade the amount of power that can be relied upon at peak times is expected to increase or about megawatts that could mean trouble especially on hot summer days when supplies are stretched thin before deregulation utilities simply would have been ordered to build more power plants but now most of the nation relies on market mechanisms to coax firms into building resources or to prompt customers into reducing energy use nercs report suggests this structure compounds the uncertainties created by fluctuating fuel prices transmission bottlenecks and the latest pressure point the need to reduce reliance on power plants that emit large quantities of the gases that contribute to global warming it added that of senior electrical engineers and shift supervisors will be eligible to retire from utility jobs in creating further stress to organizations "were just trying to stay out in front" of all the change said rick sergel president and chief executive of nerc princeton n j separately the nations big grid running organizations said in a report released yesterday that of the proposed new power generation in their markets is expected to come from renewable energy projects wind power leads the pack with times as much being added and double the amount of new capacity proposed by coal fired generators the grid operator group said the addition of so much renewable energy isnt a problem now but will challenge officials more in the future because wind and solar power are intermittent resources that cant be relied upon for around the clock energy unlike conventional coal or gas fired plants the organization of grid runners the iso rto council said of electricity supplies in their mostly deregulated markets come from renewable resources chiefly hydroelectricity at wind at and other resources such as geothermal biomass and solar power combined at the group said it has polled its members and found megawatts of demand that customers have said they can quickly turn off representing about of total demand this "demand response" capability gives grid operators a safety valve that can be used when supplies are tight or when prices are especially high it estimates well functioning markets should have to of customer demand capable of responding in this way to emergencies with help from the federal energy regulatory commission grid operators are working to beef up this capability to put more power in consumers hands the agency is approving tariffs and other regulatory mechanisms so that customers who participate in these programs will get paid market prices for their contributions if enough customer participation happens it will reduce the need for new resources see related letter "letters to the editor competition in electricity drives real efficiencies" wsj oct
