the evening wrap passing bills online edition president bush pushed lawmakers today to address a legislative backlog even as he has unsheathed his veto authority measures on spending domestic surveillance and health insurance are slogging their way through congress "with all these pressing responsibilities one thing congress should not be doing is sorting out the historical record of the ottoman empire " mr bush said referring to a house bill than would brand as genocide the wwi era mass killings of armenians mr bush appears ready for a fiscal showdown with democrats in congress he recently vetoed a bill to increase spending by &# billion on a health insurance program for poor children only the fourth veto of his presidency when republicans controlled congress mr bush didnt veto a single spending bill tomorrow the house will vote to try and override the vetoed insurance bill but mr bush sounds confident the house leadership wont muster enough votes to push him aside republicans find themselves in a difficult position as opposing the bill with its ostensibly laudable goal of insuring children is politically risky in the interim the senate began debating another spending bill totaling &# billion which includes increased funding for education health clinics job training and worker safety mr bush who critics say has belatedly rediscovered fiscal conservatism promises to veto that bill as well a surveillance law is also in the pipeline its consideration has stoked the debate over the extent to which the government should be allowed to monitor others in the name of national security a recurring issue of the bush presidency members of the house quarreled today over the bill which would expand court oversight of government electronic surveillance allowing unrestricted coverage of foreign targets but requiring special authorization if the foreign targets were likely to be in contact with u s citizens some critics of the bill say the authorization would tie up intelligence agents in legal red tape the american civil liberties union meanwhile says the bill violates constitutional prohibitions on unreasonable searches and seizures "congress has work to do to keep our people safe " mr bush said today in a white house press conference and lawmakers are poised to vote on the genocide resolution adopting the language is controversial mainly because it would greatly anger turkey a u s ally and a transshipment base for military supplies headed to iraq the modern turkish state emerged from the ottoman empire many lawmakers say calling the deaths of thousands of armenians anything but genocide would be a moral failing but support for the bill has eroded of late with as many as house members withdrawing as co sponsors monday and tuesday under pressure from the turkish lobby and the white house "congress has more important work to do than antagonizing" an important ally in the muslim world mr bush said today also today the turkish
