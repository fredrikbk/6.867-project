firm mines offline data to target online ads acxiom corp knows a lot about you it has scoured public records for how many cars you own and what your house is worth it has accumulated surveys that show if you are married and how many children you have and for years acxiom sold that information to marketers eager to use it to send mailings and make telephone pitches to consumers most likely to buy now the little rock ark company is putting those hundreds of millions of bits of data in the service of customizing which display ads to show people browsing the web a development that has raised red flags with some privacy advocates acxioms latest effort announced yesterday is one of the most aggressive in a broad push by internet and online ad companies to target display ads to specific groups of users yahoo inc and microsoft corp are among the internet companies that engage in so called behavioral targeting using information such as users web search habits and the pages they visit to pick which ads to show them when they visit their own or partner web sites time warner inc s aol unit recently bought behavioral targeting firm tacoda inc and is planning to include more targeting technology in its online ad offerings which includes the network advertising com that sells ads on thousands of web sites behavioral targeting allows a web publisher for example to charge premium rates for a luxury car ad even on a lightly visited site about needlepoint if the users previous web activity shows an interest in buying an automobile in the u s this year advertisers will spend &# million on these behaviorally targeted ads rising to a projected &# billion in according to research firm emarketer inc acxiom which recently had private equity buyers break off a proposed &# billion deal for the company has been building up its online ad business including the september acquisition of behavioral targeting firm echotarget inc "the way targeting happens in the online world today isnt all that sophisticated " says chief marketing and strategy officer rich howe acxioms new service relevance x goes further drawing on the companys database of million households to determine which ads to show acxioms consumer database includes information gleaned from sources such as public real estate and motor vehicle records surveys and warrantee cards consumers fill out estimates of annual income marital status average ages of kids home ownership and property value educational level and travel histories are also available the company classifies each u s household into clusters based it says "on that households specific consumer and demographic characteristics including shopping media lifestyle and attitudinal information " clusters range from "married sophisticates" to "penny pinchers " acxiom contracts with web sites that collect consumer addresses such as online retailers and those offering sweepstakes and surveys in a blink acxiom looks up the people who provide their addresses in its database matches them with their demographic and lifestyle clusters and places "cookies " or small pieces of tracking data on their computer hard drives when those people visit acxiom partner web sites in the future acxiom can read cluster codes embedded in the cookies and use them to pick which ads to show the company doesnt disclose the sites that carry such targeted ads but says they reach of u s internet users that allows a company selling an expensive antiwrinkle cream for example to contract with acxiom to display its ads to affluent women years or older in the "skyboxes and suburbans" or "summit estates" clusters some privacy advocates say they are concerned that acxiom risks going too far with its internet ad targeting "youre potentially seeing a link between very sophisticated offline databases being used to target online advertising " says jeff chester executive director of the center for digital democracy a nonprofit consumer advocacy group focused on digital media "thats precisely the objection that privacy advocates had back in " then the federal trade commission investigated the data collection practices of doubleclick inc one of the biggest internet ad companies at the time the company had announced plans to link consumers names and addresses with web surfing habits but the company renounced the plans after criticism the ftc dropped the investigation in response to consumer concerns online marketers established the network advertising initiative trade group and a set of guidelines for determining what information they would and would not collect about consumers marketers decided for the most part not to match offline personal data with web surfing information acxiom is not a member of the group but says its service complies with the guidelines now government examination of online targeting practices is heating up again the ftc next month is holding a two day public forum to discuss consumer protection issues stemming from the practice such issues have also been raised following the announcement of google inc s planned &# billion acquisition of doubleclick "you cant just move into this space without recognizing where the sensitivities lie " acknowledges jennifer barrett acxioms global privacy officer "weve made every effort to do that and will continue to monitor that " ms barrett says that acxiom briefed the ftc on its ad targeting plans and the regulators didnt raise significant objections the ftc wont confirm or deny if there was a meeting but a spokeswoman says the agency doesnt approve products or services before they go to market and expects companies to follow the law acxiom says the ad targeting remains anonymous because only offline cluster status gender and zip code is linked to a consumer online not the rest of the data held by acxiom and each cluster has at least one million household members acxiom also requires the partner sites that collect consumer address information that initiate the cookie placement to disclose that the data may be used by a third party for marketing purposes the companys mr howe acknowledges that most consumers likely dont know who exactly will be using the data "the majority of individuals dont know a lot about it " he says some firms that marketers pay to collect names of potential customers on the internet also are starting to work with data collection companies to combine offline data to better target their ads for example q interactive a chicago based lead generation firm owned by landmark communications inc operates a number of registration pages on web sites including about com and weather com where visitors can provide personal information this can include their name address and telephone number q interactive then takes that information and combines it with data from brewster n y based alliant cooperative data solutions q interactive now is working to use that information in the future to target the banner ads that people see on web sites online ad firm valueclick inc says it has experimented with using information gathered by data collection companies with its email marketing if consumers agree to it if the practice is disclosed and if the data remains anonymous some of the more prominent digital ad firms that specialize in behavioral targeting shy away from using the reams of data collected about people offline to target online ads these firms say they already collect enough anonymous information based on peoples online activities and would rather not tackle the privacy issues that come along with gathering offline data "many things in online advertising are very tempting because you now theyd be efficacious but you know they are a bad idea because they are not consumer friendly " says bill gossman president and ceo of revenue science a behavioral targeting firm some online ad executives fear that the moves to use offline data in targeting ads could trigger a public backlash that could affect the entire industry tacoda founder dave morgan says the firm has been approached to work with offline data management firms dozens of times but has always said no "if you scare the consumer " he reasons "you will hurt your business " target you how acxiom delivers personalized online ads  acxiom has accumulated a database of about million households and divided it into demographic and lifestyle clusters based on information available from telephone and web directories property and motor vehicle records surveys and other public sources  a person gives one of acxioms web partners his address by buying something filling out a survey or completing a contest form on one of the sites  in an eyeblink acxiom checks the address against its database and places a "cookie " or small piece of tracking data embedded with a code for that persons demographic and behavioral cluster on his computer hard drive  when the person visits an acxiom partner site in the future acxiom can use that code to determine which ads to show a member of the "gen x parents cartoons &amp carpools" cluster might be more likely to see ads for minivans than sports cars for example  through another cookie acxiom tracks what consumers do on partner web sites this allows advertisers to target consumers based on their cluster code their online activity or a combination of the two
