common sense oracles tenacity is what gives stock its allure smartmoney as an investor im delighted to see that the recent market turmoil and tighter credit have done nothing to slow down the pace of mergers and acquisitions not only do big mergers line the pockets of the investment banks in which i own shares but some of them offer tempting investment opportunities in their own right on the other hand as a concerned citizen and consumer im less than thrilled i wish the federal trade commissions antitrust enforcers had spent less time on the ill fated effort to derail the whole foods wild oats merger and would pay more attention to where i sense the real damage is being done the computer software industry by this i mean oracle which whetted its voracious appetite for competitors this week by setting its sights on bea systems if history is any guide i strongly suspect a merger would damp competition it would give oracle more market power boosting margins and profits thats why as a stock investor i love it take a look at oracles acquisition of peoplesoft the justice department filed suit in to block it on antitrust grounds and won a preliminary injunction many antitrust defendants would have thrown in the towel but not oracles larry ellison who pressed his case in court he was rewarded for his tenacity after a bruising trial a federal judge repudiated the justice department on every count clearing the way for the merger so what happened more or less what the justice department had predicted oracles revenue market share and profit soared at the time of the merger january oracle shares were about &# granted a year later they had gone nowhere and were down slightly but integrating a big acquisition takes time two years after the merger oracle shares were more than &# they recently hit an intraday high of &# no wonder last month oracle reported first quarter profit rose on a revenue gain of a stellar performance by any measure how much of this can be attributed to the peoplesoft acquisition is hard to say but having read the decision permitting the case to go forward the benefits seem obvious in resisting oracles recent offer of &# a share bea systems which describes itself as a world leader in enterprise and applications software as does oracle said its a "direct competitor" of oracle im not that familiar with nuances of competition in todays software industry but it sounds a lot like peoplesoft revisited if so there could be another long battle peoplesoft took nearly two years close scrutiny from antitrust regulators a possible injunction and even another court case in the end i expect tenacious oracle will win again if so investors will want to participate i dont own oracle shares now but i wish id bought them two years ago when i first studied the peoplesoft court decision as the bea drama unfolds ill be looking for an entry point stay tuned james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com commonsense
