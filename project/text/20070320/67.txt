groupe the agency that created the metamucil ads "sure you want to put on a nice dress but why wouldnt you want to tone your insides too " the makeover of metamucil a year old brand is the latest in a series of brand updates at procter &amp gamble rather than invest in launching new brands in recent years the company has breathed new life into tired ones mr clean was revitalized with new fragrance

older adults that baggage is something weve had to focus on overcoming " says mr podiak the campaign also treads into potentially sensitive issues asked about the possibility that the campaign could encourage abuse by people with eating disorders mr podiak says the company isnt worried because metamucil isnt a drug but a natural fiber supplement made with the grain psyllium "most people arent
