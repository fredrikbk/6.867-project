politics &amp economics changed climate on warming rep dingell a recent convert begins emissions bill hearings washington rep john dingell once dismissed global warming as a "theory " lately the democratic lawmaker from michigan has had a change of heart "the science on this question " he said recently "has been settled " mr dingells conversion as much as anything underscores the changed atmosphere on capitol hill on the issue of climate change it also explains why the chairman of the powerful house energy and commerce committee is playing host this week to al gore the former vice president who took on the issue of global warming long before mr dingell or others in the political establishment embraced it the planned appearance by mr gore whose film on climate change "an inconvenient truth " won an oscar for best documentary is part of a series of hearings that mr dingell said will set the stage for legislation later this year to control greenhouse gas emissions which are believed to contribute to global warming the legislative push comes as president bush has highlighted the importance of the issue and as an increasing number of business leaders join environmental groups in calling on congress to take action yesterday a coalition of leading u s institutional investors including merrill lynch &amp co and the california public employees retirement system waded into the fray pressing for legislation mandating emissions cuts ranging from to by the middle of this century and requiring companies to disclose investor risks associated with climate change with the securities and exchange commission these developments reflect the sharp turn taken in the debate since democrats took control of congress last november no longer is there a question about whether congress would act as was the case in the decade after world leaders in late unveiled the kyoto pact which committed major industrial powers to big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions instead the fundamental question is when u s lawmakers will move and how "ive rarely felt things were moving too fast to keep up with and now i think things are moving too fast to keep up with " said carl pope executive director of the sierra club an environmental advocacy group the sierra club is among several such groups including the wilderness society and the national resources defense council that are organizing a rally at the foot of the capitol today part of an effort to further draw lawmakers attention to the issue big hurdles still loom in the senate majority leader harry reid the nevada democrat is preparing for a likely filibuster and may need a big house vote to generate enough momentum to overcome conservative republican opposition another unknown is how the white house would respond if congress succeeds in passing a tough bill president bush mentioned climate change in his state of the union address but so far has stressed expanded use of clean burning fuels such as ethanol as the primary answer to the problem a bush spokeswoman said it is "too premature" to discuss white house intentions "we will let the legislative process take its course " she said with the white house strategy unclear democrats may eventually force a debate that aims to highlight differences between the two parties and kicks the issue into the election indeed house speaker nancy pelosi d calif recently circulated a fund raising letter that trumpeted democrats efforts on global warming in contrast to "the last six years" during which the bush administration "stifled debate to protect big oil and their special interest friends " ms pelosi is vowing for now to work across party lines but the pressure to score political points is expected to grow as approaches making mr dingells early spade work on the issue all the more important so far mr dingell has been loath to discuss legislative specifics "im sure going to avoid that like the devil avoids holy water " he said but some key principles are beginning to emerge for mr dingell and his top lieutenant in the climate change debate rep rick boucher the virginia democrat who chairs energy and commerces subcommittee on air quality mr boucher said in an interview that the pair hopes to write legislation that would impose mandatory emissions controls across the entire u s economy not just on specific sectors such as electricity production or auto manufacturing he said that means a "cap and trade" program which sets an overall limit on harmful emissions and allows industry to meet the target through a market based program is "the more likely candidate for serious consideration" within energy and commerce mr boucher voiced skepticism about proposals to simply mandate emissions reductions without giving the business community the flexibility of cap and trade he also frowned on imposing a "carbon tax" to encourage businesses to move away from production of harmful emissions saying any tax would be unpopular in the near term mr boucher said measures boosting the nations energy independence such as proposals to expand the use of alternative fuels are expected to be ready for house action this summer in terms of the broader bill controlling emissions "were looking probably at the fall " he said the timetable rankles some supporters of aggressive action anthony kreindler a spokesman at environmental defense an environmental advocacy group worries that lawmakers may cut loose the bigger package to avoid a political fight "there is that tendency particularly going into a campaign season " he said in a demonstration of his seriousness on the issue mr dingell recently circulated a letter to more than major trade associations pressing them for answers on issues raised by "the potential enactment of a cap and trade policy " among other things mr dingell wanted to know which sectors of the economy should be covered and whether there should be a "safety valve" giving companies extra time to meet mandated emissions reductions
