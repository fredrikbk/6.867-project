business technology apple opens doors by running windows ability to handle microsoft operating system may help macs make some inroads when apple inc last year switched over its line of macintosh personal computers to chips made by intel corp the move came with a nice side benefit users could run microsoft corp s windows operating system on their apple machines because windows and macs shared the underlying silicon components from intel now the support for windows on apple hardware looks to be playing a key role in persuading some users to switch to macs from windows pcs including small businesses education and other professional markets that have tilted toward windows for years helping macs gain a bit of ground within the workplace are a growing array of programs that let the machines run windows or windows applications on macs with little loss of performance last april apple began offering a free test version of a program called boot camp that lets users run windows on their macs if they own a copy of the microsoft software though users cant operate both microsoft and apple operating systems at once apple plans to integrate boot camp into a new version of the macintosh operating system dubbed leopard due out this spring and software from other companies such as one called parallels desktop for mac from swsoft inc of herndon va enables a more convenient scenario running mac and windows on an apple computer at the same time for years pcs running windows were the predominant machine in the computer labs and administrative offices of wilkes university in wilkes barre pa with macs traditionally accounting for about of the computers throughout the campus last year though the school began a switch to apple computers from windows pcs the university has installed about macs throughout the school with plans to have about apple computers on campus over the next several years the ability to run windows on the apple machines was a critical feature that made the move possible says scott byers the schools vice president for finance and general counsel "i think we would have stuck with windows" if the apple computers couldnt run the microsoft operating system says mr byers "it really made a huge difference " mr byers says the switch will allow the university to reduce the number of computers on its campus network by about since it will no longer need to have an inefficient mix of separate macs and windows pcs as a result the university expects to save about &# even though macs are a bit more expensive than comparable windows pcs and the school will still need to pay for copies of windows to run on each of the machines smaller scale mac fans also see the benefit ian vysick a senior audio engineer for a television production company in new york has bought three mac laptops within the last year for his and his familys personal use because of apples consumer friendly software and fewer hassles from viruses then mr vysick found out he could run windows simultaneously with the mac operating system on his apple computer using the &# parallels desktop for mac software he now takes his personal mac laptop to work where he runs a windows only program for configuring an intercom system used during tv productions unlike with boot camp he doesnt have to shut down and restart his computer when he wants to run windows no one believes microsofts dominance of the professional market which includes businesses education and other nonconsumer fields is in any imminent jeopardy analysts say such organizations especially big companies have far too much invested in windows for apple to ever win a big share of the market apple tacitly conceding as much puts more focus on the consumer market with products like the ipod and forthcoming iphone a spokeswoman for apple of cupertino calif declined to make an executive available for comment "i would say the opportunity there is very limited " charlie wolf an analyst at needham &amp co says of the professional market apple is making small inroads in the professional market with its critically acclaimed line of mac desktop and laptop computers and even slight market share gains can bring meaningful new business to the company last year apple accounted for of all new pc shipments in the u s professional market up from in and in according to the research firm gartner inc apples share of total new pc shipments in the u s jumped to last year from the prior year gartner says nearly all of the rest of the market is windows over the holiday quarter apple sold million macs more than in the same period a year earlier and nearly five times the growth in global pc shipments overall in the period apple chief executive steve jobs this year said the companys research showed more than half of all people buying macs were new to apple computers apples move to intel microprocessors which act as the brains of pcs has helped the mac business by giving the machines a performance boost macs may also have benefited because they have been largely free of viruses and other security woes that plague windows pcs the parallels software and a similar product from emc corp s vmware are part of a wave of new "virtualization" technologies that take advantage of the intel chips to make it easier to run windows on apple computers an older class of "emulation" software such as microsofts virtual pc let users run windows on their macs but with severely diminished performance companies that make newer windows virtualization programs for macs say they operate windows software at nearly the same speeds as they would on a traditional windows pc parallels introduced a feature in its software that lets users start up outlook and other windows applications without leaving the mac user interface parallels says it has sold hundreds of thousands of copies of its software much of it to business users the software requires users to purchase a copy of windows which can cost &# or more depending on the version of the microsoft operating system users get another company codeweavers inc has come up with software that lets users operate windows applications on a mac without requiring users to install the microsoft operating system the software based largely on the work of programmers who are part of an "open source" initiative called wine doesnt run as many windows programs on macs as parallels does
