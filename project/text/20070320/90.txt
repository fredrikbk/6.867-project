putting faith in mutual funds religious investing sometimes offers saintly returns its getting easier for investors to marry their faith in god with their faith in the stock market melissa eckstein an adviser with mpc financial services in brookfield wis recently sat down with a couple who wanted to invest in the ave maria mutual funds a family of catholic oriented offerings the couples daughter a schoolteacher had been killed by a drunken driver leaving behind a little girl "with the settlement they wanted to invest according to the values they had used to raise their daughter and were now using to help raise their granddaughter " says ms eckstein religiously themed mutual funds an offshoot of the socially responsible investing movement are flourishing there are around of these funds with assets topping &# billion according to investment researcher morningstar inc up from &# million years ago this niche now caters to lutherans thrivent financial catholics ave maria muslims amana mutual funds trust and presbyterians new covenant funds as well as christians of all faiths the timothy plan these funds mix financial with ethical considerations to find well run companies that dont profit from variously defined "sin" industries but is it smart to merge the almighty dollar with the almighty savvy mutual fund investors are concerned about two things market beating returns and low fees until recently they havent been able to find both in this fund category the track records at some religiously focused funds were spotty and the fees tended to be higher than those of standard issue funds with funds to choose from there were definitely cheaper and better options thats changing though performance has been improving as good advisers and subadvisers have honed strategies that are beating the broad market some of that is because of the multicap approach many of these funds follow which has allowed them to enjoy the run up in small cap and midcap stocks and the transition to larger issues in recent months but it also has to do with the screening process religiously themed portfolios often contain companies with low debt good earnings prospects and shareholder friendly management teams as the performance and profile of these funds have improved the assets have followed helping to cut fees "a disciplined approach will always work regardless of whether its muslim based or jewish based or christian based " says david young a former pastor who is now a regional vice president based in fairfax va for the householder group a large financial planning firm advisers though are still on the fence about where these funds fit in a typical portfolio as these funds have matured some advisers have become more comfortable making them the centerpiece of a diversified portfolio but conventional wisdom says that religious funds should account for no more than of your overall portfolio in much the same way as you might put money in small company stocks or sector plays ultimately the decision to purchase shares in one of these funds comes down to the individual if you feel strongly about your faith these products could be a good match but you still need to balance the funds religious aspect with fees and returns their approaches can differ markedly the new covenant fund family launched in grew out of a three decade long history of faith based investing by the presbyterian foundation its four funds growth income and two balanced offerings hold &# billion in assets new covenants main screen involves a trailing three year period where companies cant have more than of revenues coming from gambling or the sale of alcohol or firearms and weapons it then gives a list of companies to avoid to several subadvisers who specialize in certain strategies for example harry burn manager of sound shore a top ranking large cap value fund manages a portion of the new covenant growth and new covenant balanced growth funds new covenant growth which has returned over the past five years on par with the standard &amp poors stock index invests in a wide array of more than companies across the size spectrum top holdings include bank of america corp microsoft corp and exxon mobil corp the six ave maria funds are prohibited from investing in companies that produce pornography supply nonmarital partner benefits for their employees or support abortion regardless of how small a portion of a given firms revenue is from these operations so for example hotel chains that offer adult movies in their rooms are out of the running that screen whacks companies from the russell stock index the funds universe of potential buys manager george schwartz applies a warren buffett style of stock picking to the funds he likes companies that are trading at discounts to their intrinsic value despite strong free cash flow and decent earnings projections "we want companies that will double in price in three to four years " he says one favorite is chicos fas inc the retail clothing chain "they stubbed their toe last year with too much inventory " says mr schwartz but the downturn has been sharp he says and now the stock is a "screaming bargain " he likes that the company is still managing sales per square foot that are double that of the typical womens store the amana family of funds designed for muslims might be the most notable group of funds in this category over the trailing three and five year time periods the amana trust growth fund is ranked no by morningstar in the large cap growth category over the trailing decade it is ranked no amana bans companies that make loans or have substantial debt it also avoids alcohol and pork processors those screens knock out the largest group of companies of any religiously themed fund banks are usually out but energy commodities and health care arent its then left to manager nick kaiser to find the gems that are still standing he hasnt had a problem as of late top holdings include pepsico inc novartis ag best buy co and johnson &amp johnson the funds average annual return of over the past years beats the s&amp p by five percentage points recently he has been setting up the fund for some slow times by plowing of assets into cash
