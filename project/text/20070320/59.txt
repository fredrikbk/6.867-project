in cbot fight it all adds up to derivatives upstart ices gambit to beat chicago merc shows markets promise to understand whats at stake in the takeover battle for the chicago board of trade consider this the global business of derivatives investment contracts based on everything from how much snow colorado will get next year to the likelihood that general motors will default on its debts has grown by nearly a year for the past four years last year the value of those financial contracts exceeded &# trillion according to the bank for international settlements the old fashioned stock and bond markets pale in comparison totaling about &# trillion and &# trillion respectively "derivatives are creations the volumes depend on innovation and imagination " says diego perfumo an exchange consultant stocks are limited by the growth of the economy but "with derivatives skies are the limit " chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc and intercontinentalexchange inc are vying to become the dominant force in this powerful corner of the financial markets by acquiring cbot holdings inc chicago board of trades owner last year chicago merc and cbot agreed to a deal that would create the worlds largest financial exchange by stock market value but now the intercontinentialexchange is nosing in yesterday the cbot authorized talks with that atlanta company on a rival offer that ice floated last week the pace of trading magnifies the differences between stocks and derivatives because shares dont change hands nearly as much as futures contracts and the like about &# trillion worth of stock traded hands on exchanges world wide in according to the world federation of exchanges that year the chicago merc alone oversaw short term interest rate wagers of about &# trillion approaching the size of the overall derivatives market itself with exchanges taking a tiny cut of every trade the revenue generated by derivatives is likewise daunting last year stock trading in north america and europe generated &# billion in revenues for exchanges while exchange based derivative trading in those markets generated &# billion according to investment bank keefe bruyette &amp woods the outcome of the fight over cbot will affect an array of investors and consumers touching stock buyers borrowers and farmers trying to protect themselves from commodity price swings the cbot and the chicago merc in october announced a merger agreement that would create a company worth nearly &# billion the two institutions got their starts in the s matching buyers and sellers of corn and other food staples those products are in the minority in a business dominated by financial futures contracts that allow hedge funds and other sophisticated investors to bet on where interest rates stock indexes currencies and myriad other financial indicators are heading the ice a seven year old upstart that mainly focuses on energy derivatives countered last week with a higher bid for cbot the deal would create a company with a &# billion stock market value the cbot now must decide whether to abandon the merc in favor of the ice the merc had planned to put the deal to a shareholder vote on april but now may delay that people familiar with the matter said trading derivatives is strikingly profitable american exchanges collect on average cents or so for every derivatives contract traded last year about eight billion such contracts changed hands on the worlds exchanges by contrast the new york stock exchanges owner nyse group inc collects about one tenth of a penny for each share traded in trillion shares traded world wide that helps explain why derivatives exchanges make more profit per dollar of revenue than stock market peers the ice pockets of revenues in profits while nyse pockets less than half that the merc for its part made &# million last year roughly twice the nyse in both europe and the u s businesses that trade derivatives have much bigger stock market values profit growth in derivatives industry is likely to outpace stock exchange profits going forward in ices profits more than tripled to &# million and the mercs rose profit growth also spiked at nasdaq stock market inc by to &# million and the nyse by more than to &# million but results at both stemmed more from recent restructurings than long term trends the money at stake explains why the ice bid is supported by officials at morgan stanley goldman sachs group inc societe generale and other wall street firms the chicago merc and cbot and other regulated exchanges handle less than of the global &# trillion plus derivatives pie the rest of the contracts are privately negotiated instruments that wall street firms trade among themselves and with clients generating their own torrents of revenue the growth of derivatives exchanges depends mainly on stealing that so called over the counter business by creating standardized contracts that can be traded publicly the cbot merc deal would create a much more powerful competitor for that business that already would control of the u s market for exchange traded futures contracts giving it power to jack up prices for existing contracts while creating bargain basement new contracts for derivatives now traded mainly over the counter a cbot ice combination wouldnt be nearly as formidable controlling just of that market and leaving the merc with a fierce rival that would help keep down trading costs and make grabbing business from wall street more difficult the merc already is pushing aggressively into areas dominated by wall street banks including foreign currency trading and customized interest rate and credit swaps contracts that offer insurance against rate changes and defaults some merc customers such as hedge funds and trading firms say bringing those products onto an exchange will make them cheaper to trade overall because more people will find them quickly even before the ice counteroffer some wall street firms had argued the merc should be required to open up parts of its business to more competition as a condition of letting the cbot deal close the justice department is reviewing the mercs cbot deal to see if it would violate antitrust rules the merc contends that because so little of the derivatives business is conducted on exchanges they should be allowed to grow so that more trades would be transparent to all investors and regulated the merc cbot and ice these days focus their growth efforts on developing new products unlike the nyse nasdaq and the london stock exchange which spend much of their resources courting companies for new stock listings and speeding up trading during the past seven years cme and cbot have introduced new products including contracts tied to ethanol and weather both exchanges have entire divisions created to researching new products to be sure the derivatives boom has also helped stock exchanges because many of the contracts are based on stock values including options and index futures increased trading of stock options which give buyers the right to buy or sell stocks at set prices in the future begets increased stock trading the lse estimates that of the total volume of its stock trading results from derivatives trades and that between a third and a a half of the growth in share trading since has come from derivatives seeing derivatives as a path to faster growth the nyse last year moved to buy european market operator euronext nv which trades both stock and derivatives and makes more on the latter the decision marked a reversal for the nyse which years earlier had sold off its derivatives businesses various factors combine to make derivatives a bigger more profitable business futures exchanges make much of their money from fees charged for making sure that trades are completed promptly and guaranteeing that both sides are paid a behind the scenes function known as clearing in the u s stock market business clearing is handled by the unit of a separate company primarily owned by brokerage firms clearing also enhances derivative exchanges power to retain market share and raise prices a merc product for the most part trades only on that exchange because it handles the clearing stocks can trade on any exchange the ability to invest with borrowed money leverage has driven the growth of the derivatives business a typical derivatives bet on an exchange can involve to leverage in other words an investor can make a &# million bet with only &# million down so if the investments value rises to &# million the investor has doubled his money stock trading doesnt allow nearly as much leverage which is why hedge funds and other sophisticated players have flocked to riskier derivatives alistair macdonald contributed to this
