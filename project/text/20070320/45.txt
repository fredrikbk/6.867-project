global economy china expands rail system in effort to narrow prosperity gap hong kong china worried about the wide income gap between its highly developed coastal areas and its lagging interior is looking to railways to help spread the wealth in recent years chinas breakneck economic growth has lifted millions of people out of poverty but the economic divide that growth has left behind poses a challenge for the ruling communist party which has staked its legitimacy on its ability to make people richer and is worried about the potential for social unrest chinese premier wen jiabao addresses the wealth gap in speeches and policy initiatives the governments latest campaign upgrade chinas vast but overburdened rail system to link more parts of the country to one another and to overseas markets or as chinas policy makers put it "to build up a harmonious socialist society the development of railways has to be sped up " the plan calls for the government to nearly quadruple its investment in the nations railroads to almost &# billion by the aim is to create miles of new track much of it in underserved central and western china by the end of the decade if china meets its goal the rail system will have grown to more than miles the investment would provide a missing link in chinas logistical infrastructure the nations seaports are among the worlds most modern and efficient but its railroads which could be supplying these ports with a lot of the goods they send abroad arent up to the task in many other countries railroads carry as much as of all containerized freight chinas historically underfunded tracks transport less than of its shipping containers almost all of chinas exports arrive dockside via truck yet trucks in china are cost effective only over distances of roughly miles or a single days road journey according to transportation experts investors who want to produce goods for export have balked at building factories in provinces where reliable transportation links to seaports are scarce as a result investment in chinese export oriented industries has been concentrated overwhelmingly along the coasts and major rivers near chinas ports james wang a transportation geographer at the university of hong kong calculates that no less than of chinas international trade value is generated within miles of the coast this investment pattern deepens the countrys internal economic fault line chinas prosperity gap has become so entrenched that it finds a rough parallel in the former colonial economies of asia and africa where ports and some coastal regions were connected to the international economy while most of the hinterlands were left largely to themselves in colonial nigeria for example the british laid railways from resource rich areas in the interior to haul tin peanuts and other lucrative commodities to the coast for export many people involved in these industries became part of the capitalistic cash economy and saw some material benefits many others continued in their traditional occupations and were relatively untouched by this export oriented activity just as hundreds of millions of chinese arent affected by the nations export led boom large numbers of chinese have moved from inland regions to find better paying jobs in coastal enclaves economist sir w arthur lewis who studied britains colonies noted the propensity of people to migrate to the capitalistic sector if wages there were attractive "the pattern of development that you are seeing in china is very similar to an african colonial model it centers on the seaport thats where globalization came in " says becky p y loo who like mr wang is a transportation geographer at the university of hong kong of course there are major differences between the two models chinas interior includes dozens of modern cities with large populations and thousands of businesses and while chinas interior has lagged behind the coast in attracting export oriented investment foreign investors have placed bets on inland areas too in the hope of profiting from domestic consumption railways offer the prospect of bringing chinas two economies closer together if the colonial model is in some respects where chinas rail system finds itself today the transformation of the u s economy in the late th century is closer to where beijing wants to go in the u s the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in connected the industrializing eastern states with the pacific coast that rail link and others built in later years were crucial in opening the sparsely settled western territories to settlement and making possible the development of ranching mining and other businesses china already has a rail link to distant tibet completed just last year the railway buildout however could have an important impact on the flow of people and goods and on the spread of prosperity in the nation a centerpiece of the plan is the creation of logistics centers to expedite the distribution of containers throughout china the plan also seeks to boost railway container traffic by promoting the use of double stack container cars chinas reliance on trucks makes for costlier logistics delays in time sensitive deliveries for example can cause a computer producer to lose overseas sales by reducing that risk a producer could add one percentage point to his profit margins says evan auyang a specialist in chinese transportation at mckinsey &amp co in hong kong that is another upshot of investing in railways chinese exports could become even more competitive than they already are juying qin contributed to this article
