why miners look for buried treasure in belgian museum legacy of king leopold ii its maps and rocks direct firms to congo hot spots tervuren belgium for decades geologist johan lavreau has minded a musty maze of african maps papers and rocks stored in the bowels of a museum celebrating belgiums colonial stewardship of the congo between and it was a lonely job he saw few visitors other than geology students and academics now the year olds archives beneath the royal museum for central africa in a leafy suburb of brussels are a hot destination clamoring to pore over the maps global mining operations hungry for clues about where to find the congos vast riches of copper cobalt gold tin and other treasures mr lavreaus recent visitors include a whos who of big diggers australias bhp billiton de beers of south africa and areva a french nuclear company all driven by the boom in commodity prices china and india thirsty for raw materials to keep up their explosive growth are largely responsible "i guess we need to start thinking like a business " says the career civil servant with a trace of melancholy brittle faded field maps drawn by hand are stacked haphazardly in victorian cabinets smelling of old wood red brick and damp plaster nearby lie other colonial relics brought home by the belgians including monkey skulls stuffed fish and six million bugs the only trace of modernity a steel door leading to a radioactive bunker with a pound chunk of congo uranium unearthed from the same spot that produced the fuel for the nuclear bombs dropped on japan at the end of world war ii for mining firms not only is the prospecting a lot easier in a belgian basement it often yields more than geologists find with the most sophisticated radar and sonar technology today gathering detailed information in the country made famous by joseph conrads novel "heart of darkness" is both wildly expensive and dangerous one of the worlds bloodiest civil wars only recently ended there armed militias still patrol the bush "the old colonial mapping was more thorough and detailed " says david ovadia head of the british geological surveys international division "today it would be a military operation to get what one colonial geologist on a horse could get in one lifetime " meanwhile a french institute housing records from former colonies like algeria and laos also reports rising interest "they started knocking on our door months ago " says marielle arregros a map historian at the bureau des recherches geologiques et minieres in orleans the bgs which is home to old maps from afghanistan to zambia now generates half its annual &# million revenue from consulting work but few places are hotter than the democratic republic of the congo long known as one of the globes richest mineral troves the charge for poking around in mr lavreaus stacks is a modest &# a day the only physical risk a hangover from the strong belgian beer sold at the popular brasseries across the street selling access to the brussels archives which belong to the belgian government has raised some eyebrows in kinshasa "its a legitimate question why theyre not here " says valentin kanda nkula director of the congos national geological service "it would be nice to share revenue " the congo once had copies of the same archives but most were lost looted or destroyed the country adds mr lavreau ground up its rock samples to make gravel for a parking lot miners can thank belgiums king leopold ii who controlled the congo until for the riches preserved in tervuren the brooding autocratic king ordered surveyors and their slaves up and down the vast country they mapped the land by hand their followers panned millions of soil samples and collected millions of rocks in the belgian colonial government in leopoldville now kinshasa ordered private mining companies to turn over their records to help the allies find resources that could help in the war effort against germany the congo shipped millions of tons of copper and tin and some uranium to the u s after the war crates of papers some copies of the originals and rocks were moved to leopolds museum built in as a celebration of the virtues of colonization today belgiums colonial administration is best known for its brutal treatment of slaves forced to collect rubber in a company called anvil mining ltd of perth australia wanted to dig in the southeast of the congo where belgian companies had mined copper in the years following anvil asked the museum for help analyzing new satellite maps "we took a map color coded for soil type based on even older records and superimposed it over a satellite map to give a total picture " says mr lavreau with a capital expenditure of only &# million including a small fee for the museum anvil began producing copper in the project is expected ultimately to generate net profit of &# million despite recent controversy the united nations said anvil in october provided vehicles and planes to government troops to quell an uprising near its mine the troops killed scores of villagers including children the u n said anvil didnt return calls and email seeking comment it has denied any wrongdoing sometimes the belgian archives steer companies away from bad investments two years ago bhp billiton decided after analyzing modern computer generated maps that there might be enough bauxite a raw material used to make aluminum near the congos atlantic coast to merit a new mine bhp called guy franceschi a belgian geological consultant in ghent he suggested a visit to the museum luc tack a senior geologist at the museum recalls escorting bhp officials to the museums basement without help from mr lavreau and his team finding what you need is next to impossible mr tack picks out a thick book of loose papers sandwiched in cardboard and tied with string and finds the map that he showed bhp made in the s the map is covered in a grid with each intersection representing a spot every yards where belgian engineers dug a well and collected a soil sample inside each box are small pink squares showing where bauxite had been found mr tack then fetches a small plastic bag of loose rocks and sand soil samples from the grid after three weeks of analysis bhp concluded the quantity of bauxite underground wasnt sufficient to merit a new dig bhps total bill was just over &# a fraction of what it would have had to pay to explore the site and reach the same conclusion "if we had to repeat all the drilling today it would cost a significant amount of both time and money " says harri illtud a spokesman for bhp billiton these days mr lavreaus only regret is not having the time or solitude to wander undisturbed among his rocks and papers as he and his predecessors in the congo once did "nowadays " he says "people only have time to look for money "
