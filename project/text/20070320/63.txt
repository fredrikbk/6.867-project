justice for lebanon almost unnoticed by the global media a crucial turning point has arrived in the u n investigation into the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in february it is also a turning point for the credibility of the international community a report by the chief of the investigation belgian serge brammertz presented to u n secretary general ban ki moon on march establishes that the specific motives for the assassination were strictly political they involved reactions to u n security council resolution which demanded syrias withdrawal from lebanon hariris opposition to the syrian driven extension of the term of lebanese president emile lahoud and hariris bid to end pro syrian domination of the lebanese regime in the may lebanese parliamentary elections after many months of painstaking assembly and analysis of physical interview and communications evidence mr brammertz has essentially confirmed the findings of his predecessor detlev mehlis the syrian lebanese security apparatus that commanded beirut up to whose overlords are presidents bashar assad of syria and emile lahoud of lebanon is the prime and only suspect for the hariri murder his report emphasizes the elaborate character of the murder conspiracy effectively dismissing the "aerial delivery hypothesis" for the bombing and brushing aside the islamic fundamentalist and science fiction scenarios floated by the syrian regime and its apologists the next step should be to establish the special mixed international lebanese tribunal envisaged in u n security council resolution of march to prosecute hariris murderers and their instigators all security council members approved the draft protocol detailing the tribunals authority after protracted negotiation between lebanese and u n legal experts but syrias allies led by president lahoud and hezbollah have prevented lebanons parliament from voting on the protocol and campaigned to destroy the government of prime minister fuad siniora syria and hezbollah wish to neuter the tribunal protocol why they object to heads of organizations being held responsible for actions of their subordinates and to international prosecutions for involvement in other murders and bombings in lebanon since october if these incidents link with the hariri case since the u n inquiry has detected interconnections between the hariri assassination and murders and attempted murders of other prominent lebanese personalities the tribunal under the draft protocol could pursue trails of evidence from a variety of incidents up the chain of command of a state or organization after five unanimous security council resolutions on the u n murder inquiry and the proposed special tribunal the credibility of international justice is at stake in the hariri case yet the investigation unfortunately also coincides with an irrepressible itch for western politicians to "engage" baathist syria most reprehensible was the trip to damascus on march of eu high representative javier solana amid european hints of "flexibility" regarding the tribunal mr solana broke a two year eu moratorium on such visits the newspaper al thawra a mouthpiece of the syrian regime triumphantly crowed that mr solanas mission proved that syrian policies were "correct and do not need to be changed others should make the required change " the west should be standing behind lebanese prime minister siniora and safeguarding international justice represented by the hariri tribunal protocol from assault and battery by syria and its cronies to his credit president george w bush has been stalwart on this issue but there are dangerous diplomatic riptides the tribunal protocol is currently subject to horse trading among lebanese factions and middle eastern regimes the iranians are on the line with the saudis to establish a "compromise" that would enable the syrian leadership to sail through the murder affair saving the central cog of the iran syria hezbollah alignment the saudis apparently prefer mr sinioras government to settle with the hezbollah led opposition before the arab summit in riyadh on march and therefore to submit the tribunal to a lebanese political committee for "minor adjustments " syria and hezbollah will do their best to ensure that the tribunal protocol never re emerges from such a committee it would be a terrible precedent to bend the terms of international justice to suit the comfort and convenience of middle eastern autocracies and theocracies it is also presumptuous of the lebanese to suppose that their domestic factional arrangements should in any way bind the core business of the international community if murder suspects and their friends prevent lebanon from endorsing the existing u n approved draft protocol of the hariri tribunal the matter must return to the security council for creation of a purely international alternative under chapter vii of the u n charter chapter vii would authorize draconian sanctions including military action in the event of defiance of the special tribunal mr harris teaches in the political studies department at the university of otago new zealand
