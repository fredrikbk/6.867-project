the case builds for chickenpox vaccinations the growing case for a second dose of the chickenpox vaccine is drawing attention to a product that has been on the market for more than a decade but that some parents continue to view warily the number of cases of chickenpox has fallen dramatically in the u s since merck &amp co s vaccine varivax was introduced in but there continue to be outbreaks and an estimated to cases of chickenpox each year according to the centers for disease control and prevention this month at an elementary school in dobbs ferry n y for instance children in grades three to five came down with chickenpox twenty three of them had been vaccinated according to the school district the cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices last summer recommended that children get second doses of the chickenpox vaccine a study published last week in the new england journal of medicine bolstered the case for a second dose the study said the longer patients had gone since getting one dose the more likely they were to come down with the disease and the greater the risk they would develop a moderate or severe case but the call for second doses is also unearthing concerns that many parents had voiced when the vaccine first came out fearful that the vaccines power might fade some parents have preferred that their children actually contract the disease while still young rather than get the vaccine and risk coming down with chickenpox later in life when the disease is typically more severe and there is a greater risk of complications pockets of parents today continue to hold "chickenpox parties " bringing their children to romp around with children who have the disease in the hopes that the healthy ones will catch it julie love a nurse in mansfield mass says she had hoped her daughter now would catch chickenpox as a child because her nursing research had taught her the vaccine might not provide lifelong immunity but ms love was required by a preschool to get her daughter vaccinated at age "if i had had a choice i would not have gotten her vaccinated unless she managed to not catch it by the time she was or so " says ms love public health officials say that attitude is misplaced not only because chickenpox has the potential to be much more serious than parents think but also because the vaccine itself has changed the nature of the debate the disease is far less common than it used to be reducing the likelihood of catching chickenpox in early childhood they say "its even more important now that you get vaccinated so you dont become a or year old who has no protection at all " says jane seward acting deputy director of the cdcs division of viral diseases and the senior author of the study published last week in the new england journal of medicine doctors also worry that children who arent vaccinated and catch the disease may pass it on to people who are more vulnerable to complications the cdc advisory committees recommendation is for children who havent had chickenpox to get a first dose at to months of age and a second between ages and since the vaccine came out two doses have been recommended for those age and older who havent had the disease the cdc also recommends that people who have already been vaccinated go back for a second shot many adults view chickenpox whose medical name is varicella as little more than a nuisance "its no big deal " says julie groat a mother in monument colo who runs an online group that is trying to organize a chickenpox party in her area ms groat says she has been looking for over a year for a child with chickenpox to spread the disease to her daughter "you get it you get these itchy spots and your mom dots you up with calamine lotion and youre done " she says shes right to a point chickenpox is usually mild causing a rash itching fever and fatigue but on rare occasions it can be more serious leading to pneumonia brain damage or death more commonly it can lead to severe bacterial skin infections or scars before the vaccine was available each year in the u s there were on average four million cases of chickenpox of those to patients were hospitalized and to died with children accounting for about half of deaths according to the cdc since the vaccine came out hospitalizations have declined by about and deaths by about according to the cdc varivax has been about effective at preventing chickenpox and or better at preventing severe cases the cdcs dr seward says the main reason for the second dose was that some patients respond only partially or not at all to the first one dr seward says another possibility is that as the vaccine makes the disease less common people arent getting the natural boost to their immune systems from repeat exposures says joseph bocchini chairman of the american academy of pediatrics committee on infectious diseases the extra shot often bolsters immune responses for good he says its unknown how long immunity from the second dose will last though it is expected to prevent more cases says dr seward its possible that down the road a third shot may be called for at the elementary school in dobbs ferry n y one of the children who caught chickenpox had gotten the second shot robert w steele a pediatrician at st johns childrens hospital in springfield mo and chairman of missouris childhood immunization advisory committee says after the chickenpox vaccine came out in the mid s his advice contrary to established guidelines was that patients could hold out until age before getting it but now he has changed his mind "youre not likely going to run into somebody with chickenpox so you might as well protect them at the earliest possible time " says dr steele who has given lectures sponsored by vaccine manufacturers including merck "i still have concerns about long term efficacy but a lot less now that a second dose" has been recommended at least five states have added the second dose to their vaccine requirements for school to go into effect this fall or next and at least five have started the process according to the association of immunization managers an organization of state immunization programs in georgia for example children will be required to get the second dose for entry into kindergarten or grade six unless they can provide proof of immunity or documentation theyve had chickenpox the second dose will also be required of children in any grade entering georgia schools for the first time the call for booster shots comes with a significant price tag merck says it sells the vaccine directly to private sector customers such as wholesalers and doctors for a typical amount of &# and for &# to the cdc and others in the public sector major insurers such as unitedhealthcare aetna inc and cigna corp say they cover both the first and second doses merck doesnt break out sales of varivax individually in its financial results but the impact of the second dose on sales has already been "very positive " says spokeswoman christine fanelle parents have also expressed confusion about the vaccines ability to prevent or lead to the spread of shingles a more serious and painful disease that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox patients who catch chickenpox are susceptible to shingles because the virus remains in their bodies and can be reactivated as shingles typically in adulthood the product label for varivax says the vaccines long term effect on the incidence of shingles is unknown dr bocchini of the aap says some data have shown a reduced risk for shingles among people who have gotten the vaccine though it is still early to assess the vaccines ability to prevent shingles sara schaefer muoz contributed to this article
