recruiting competition heats up graduates are lured with such things as limousine rides free ipods the m b a job market has continued to heat up this year resulting in multiple offers and heftier salaries for many lucky full time graduates jeffrey rice executive director of career services at the fisher college of business at ohio state university may have the best perspective on the recruiting scene because of his additional role as president of the m b a career services council by keeping in touch with the councils members about career service officials and corporate recruiters mr rice closely monitors hiring trends m b a track columnist ron alsop recently talked with mr rice about the bullish job market possible talent shortages and the ways technology is changing the recruiting process wsj how intense has the competition for m b a graduates become this year mr rice theres fiercer competition mainly because more industries have ramped up their recruiting specifically retail insurance and other financial services private equity health care and technology at the same time activity is up in the m b a bellwethers consulting investment banking and consumer products with to more companies in those industries doing recruiting for students that means there are more diverse opportunities in what is clearly a sellers market wsj are some companies facing an m b a talent shortage this year mr rice many companies are asking "will there be enough m b a students for us to recruit for our future leadership moving forward " already some companies in the bellwether industries are not going to meet their projected yield this year an investment bank that wanted to hire associates this year may end up getting only to their credit the company plans to increase its pipeline of summer interns this year to try to avoid a shortfall again next year for full time recruits if it only wanted summer associates before now its hoping to get and focus on converting many of them to full time hires by the end of the internship wsj how are schools helping companies deal with a potential scarcity of full time m b a students mr rice many schools including fisher are expanding the supply base by adding career service resources to bring older part time and executive m b a students into the recruiting mix along with some of our alumni wsj is it more challenging to recruit part time and executive m b a students mr rice the most significant challenge is finding a convenient time to meet with them were encouraging companies to do presentations and interviews when its more amenable for our working students in the evening instead of the afternoon virtual recruiting can also work we recently made webcams available to full time part time and executive m b a students at fisher so they can borrow one plug it into their computer and ask a company to do an interview remotely wsj is technology changing m b a recruiting in any other ways mr rice technology is definitely becoming more and more important in reaching the current millennial generation of students but companies should realize that todays m b a students can smell spam a mile away and want communication that is individualized and sincere as a result some companies are doing more instant messaging and sending more personalized emails telling students they have been identified as top candidates and inviting them to call with any questions podcasts are another increasingly popular way to reach students and give them information about a company and its culture before they interview with a recruiter our m b a s really like the progressive nature of podcasts companies are also starting to do recruiting blogs sometimes managed by an employee who is an alumnus from the target school wsj is the recruiting process as heated as it was during the dot com heyday in the late s mr rice that was a really unusual time an anomaly i dont think the recruiting opportunities are as prolific as they were then but today the choices are less entrepreneurial less risky in nature the job offers are coming from more sustainable stable industries today and if theres one thing thats definitely true about the millennial generation of m b a s its that theyre looking for stable companies where the financial rewards are clear and they can see the trajectory for how they can advance wsj it appears that recruiters are making a full court press to woo students what are some of their tactics mr rice its pretty amazing stuff weve had students taken by limousine from the ohio state campus in columbus to cleveland for interviews others were flown by corporate jet to providence r i a consumer packaged goods company put on a two day event for prospective interns from several different schools and gave each student an ipod with his or her favorite music preloaded on it wsj of course the bottom line in recruiting is compensation how much are companies willing to pay m b a graduates in this competitive market mr rice starting salaries continue to rise this year at fisher with about of our second year students having accepted a job we are up from last year to a median base salary of &# while starting salaries are always a factor students are getting much more focused on compensation over the first five to eight years on the job they arent necessarily taking the highest monetary offer if they believe the compensation trajectory is higher at a company with a slightly lower initial offer for example in consumer packaged goods if a student starts as assistant brand manager or brand manager he can expect &# to &# but in five years he could become a senior marketing director with compensation of &# plus so he may recoup the costs of the m b a degree quicker on that career path than on another where the compensation rises only &# in five years
