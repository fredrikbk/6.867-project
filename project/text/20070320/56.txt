is the climate we have now the best of all climates for earth in their march editorial page commentary "a future for fossil fuel " john deutch and ernest moniz assume that measures to reduce co concentration in the atmosphere would be worth some unspecified cost we should not accept that scientists say that for millions of years the climate has cycled between hotter and colder but they dont know why messrs deutch and moniz should give convincing reasons why the climate we happen to have now is the best of all the climates but they simply ignore that logical responsibility after choosing such a climate target the authors would have the logical responsibility of demonstrating the effect of co concentration on climate those who do discuss this matter cite computer models that are so bad they cannot even reproduce the ice ages other pseudoscientists tell us that temperature data show the surface is warming but not the atmosphere they dont realize that this observation contradicts the computer models they cite they know nothing about measuring temperatures yet they proclaim temperatures rose degree celsius in the th century and are alarmed craig landefeld washington mich the mit coal study summarized by messrs deutch and moniz has much to recommend it the debate over how to limit carbon emissions without crippling world economic development has been encumbered by impractical economics and dreams of continents spread over by expensive alternative energy sources the focus on steps needed to implement carbon capture and sequestration ccs is commendable however why is a carbon tax the seemingly knee jerk solution to coal company reluctance to invest in the needed technologies why arent tax incentives on the table they have been shown effective in slowing u s emissions growth relative to europe despite its commitment to kyoto roger w cohen durango colo messrs deutch and moniz are admirably evenhanded and quantitative in discussing the potential costs and trade off of alternative methods of carbon sequestration so why are they so casual and even sloppy about the underlying issues how much of global warming is caused by human use of fossil fuel how much can this human impact be reduced and how much might such a reduction in carbon emission reduce global warming surely the answer to all three questions is not as they imply "all of it " isnt it likely that when these three fractions are multiplied together we can expect only a small reduction in warming at a cost that may be greater than the cost of adaptation to warming the tendency of "believers" to state or imply black and white answers where there must be shades of gray is probably the main reason so many of us are still skeptics or if you prefer "deniers " robert a dobie m d washington
