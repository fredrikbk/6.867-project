capital complaints if the financial pre eminence of the u s is eroding as several recent reports contend whats really to blame sarbanes oxley surely hasnt helped and an sec that advertises itself as a prosecutor is no drawing card but when you listen closely to what foreign and u s business and finance people are saying theres one central cause private class action enforcement of the secs rule b this rule which forbids untrue statements of material fact and schemes to defraud was originally laid down as the centerpiece of the secs market monitoring responsibilities it has however because of private class actions become like an accelerant poured on a flame the possibility that a company will face a class action lawsuit if its stock price falls makes all the other problems worse consider sarbox initially the sec estimated that creating the internal controls required under section and their certification by auditors would cost on average &# per company in reality the cost runs into many millions for most companies and billions for all public companies as a group although the sec has now begun a retrenchment trying to persuade companies and accountants to adopt a less expensive a "risk based" approach to internal controls its not likely to work since the sec the companies and the auditors have different risks in mind the sec thinks risk based means the material items that can affect a financial report but companies and auditors think that the real risk is missing the one internal control that viewed in hindsight could have prevented a financial restatement and a stock price decline for them risk based controls are those that reduce their litigation risk sarbox is only one feature of the u s regulatory system that is exacerbated by class action risk boards and audit committees complain that they spend more time on legal and regulatory compliance than on the business of the company managements complain that they are required to restate their financial reports for trivial reasons and no longer have collegial relationships with either their boards or their auditors auditors complain that they can no longer advise their audit clients without worrying about the loss of their independence and managements and boards have grown more risk averse as they contemplate the consequences of a losing quarter at times it seems the purpose of companies is to issue accurate financial reports rather than to add value for shareholders and fear of unwarranted and expensive class action litigation is at the bottom of this as one participant in the treasury departments conference last week exclaimed "we announced a transaction today and ive been sued three times already " in the january report "sustaining new yorks and the u s s global financial services leadership " mayor michael bloomberg and senator charles schumer noted that "not only are foreign companies staying away from u s capital markets for fear that the potential costs of litigation will more than outweigh any incremental benefits of cheaper capital but a number of interviewees also suggested that the legal environment is detrimental to americas spirit of entrepreneurialism and innovation as one interviewee put it our ceos have become indexers they are as afraid to outperform as to underperform " the decline of the u s as a venue for financial transactions cannot reasonably be denied at this point the argument is about causes while it is no doubt true that foreign markets have become more mature and are now competing more effectively with our own the data also suggest that in our zeal for investor protection we have passed beyond the point of balancing it with a hospitable environment for financial activity we are now aiding competitive venues by pushing transactions away foreign companies are still coming to the u s to raise funds but much less so in the public securities markets where class action liability lurks in for example for the first time more equity financing was raised in private transactions under the secs rule a &# billion than was raised in ipos on the nyse nasdaq and the amex combined &# billion so what are the benefits of the class action litigation system precious little companies are often compelled to settle meritless class actions in order to avoid even more costly legal fees and drains on management time class actions do not always punish the actual wrongdoers who are often indemnified by their companies or covered by insurance and with recoveries averaging to class actions dont even compensate the people who actually suffered losses the defendant companys settlement is in effect a transfer to the complainants and their lawyers from the innocent long term shareholders of the company perhaps most significant of all a single successful class action judgment could result in the destruction of one of the big four auditing firms a catastrophic loss for the global financial community with so little to recommend them why have securities class actions survived for so long one reason may be a misperception that they are part of the pattern of the securities laws some people even think of them as constitutional rights but this is wrong a private right of action under ruleb was created by a court in and since then congress and the supreme court have been trying unsuccessfully to place some limit on them congress has authorized private rights of action under some sections of the securities laws but not for the section on which rule b was based yet the odd mystique of this costly compensation system lives on despite all the reports indicting securities class actions only mayor bloomberg and senator schumer called for more than a mere study "the sec " they said "should make use of its broad rulemaking and exemptive powers to deter the most problematic securities related suits " its doubtful that the sec will pick up this baton but even if it did history shows that courts cannot discipline themselves to distinguish effectively between the well founded suits and the "problematic" ones the only solution is restoring what congress originally intended enforcement of rule b only by the sec the fact that a democratic senator has stepped forward to press this issue should encourage those who know what the problem is but have thus far been reluctant to address it mr wallison a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute was general counsel at the treasury department and white house counsel in the reagan administration see related letter "letters to the editor dont give up securities class actions yet" wsj march
