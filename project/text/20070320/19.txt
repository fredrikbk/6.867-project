chinas air ambitions face obstacles beijing hopes to tap lucrative market dominated by boeing and airbus can china compete with airbus and boeing with its proven technical expertise and increasing mountain of cash china believes it finally has what it takes to realize a decadeslong ambition to create a successful industry for manufacturing commercial aircraft "through more than years of development our nations aviation industry already has the technical and material base to develop large scale aircraft " the state council chinas cabinet said in a prepared statement issued sunday it said it will establish companies "as soon as possible" to produce large passenger aircraft some aviation industry executives argue that marshaling the necessary resources to build serviceable passenger jets is only part of the challenge with some saying the effort could take longer than china expects they say that beyond the significant technical hurdles china will face challenges when it tries to market its unfamiliar planes to airlines provide customer support and spare parts for them and secure approval to sell them abroad "they put a man into orbit we know that takes a lot of interlinked technical competences " says martin craigs president of aerospace forum asia a business group of suppliers to the airline industry in asia "but its not just industrial engineering its the finessing of the commercial with the technical and all the huge responsibilities of planning and certificating large commercial aircraft " in the s and s chinese industry despite the advantage of cheap labor was unable to produce complex machinery at prices and of quality comparable with the output of western nations and japan but decades of technological exchange with the outside world and significant foreign investment in china have transformed the landscape semiconductor factories only one or two generations behind the global cutting edge are operating in shanghai in guangzhou honda motor co is building cars for export to europe shipbuilding another heavy industry that has received strong government support is expanding quickly china is the worlds third largest producer of ships in terms of tonnage of ships built behind japan and top ranked south korea and china state shipbuilding corp plans to be the worlds largest shipbuilder by tonnage by the chinese government is making aviation its next priority in part to supply the countrys burgeoning airlines china is the worlds fastest growing major market for commercial aircraft and boeing co forecasts that china will need planes valued at nearly &# billion during the years ending in airbus aims to set up an assembly plant for single aisle as in the coastal city of tianjin and start production there in china for years has manufactured parts for boeing and airbus the two plane making giants including landing gear and emergency exit doors for airbuss workhorse a and rudders for the next generation boeing at least of all boeing planes in the world contain parts made in china for airbuss global fleet the comparable figure is greater than the country is setting its sights higher china is building a seat regional jet and plans to design and produce larger passenger aircraft by that would compete with boeing and airbus which between them supply the vast bulk of planes flown by chinese airlines boeing appears unfazed "even with this recent development in china the boeing strategy in china and in other countries will not change " the chicago company said in a statement "that strategy is focused on longstanding business relationships based on mutual benefit " airbus a unit of franco german european aeronautic defence &amp space co didnt reply to calls seeking comment on the state councils decision chinas leaders for decades have looked to aircraft manufacturing as a symbol of industrial strength and commercial independence in the government ordered state industry to produce a large seat airplane that could rival foreign made products though the yun survived its test flight quality and technology problems proved insurmountable and the project was later abandoned in the s mcdonnell douglas played to that ambition by setting up a joint venture to produce its planes locally hoping to get a lock on the chinese market the project foundered when chinas airlines proved unwilling to replace imported boeing and airbus jets with a domestic product of uncertain quality and higher cost chinas latest attempt to enter the commercial aircraft market the arj is a seat to seat jet intended to handle shorter routes the state owned company running the effort called china aviation industry corp i or avic i is mainly a defense contractor and has faced persistent questions about its ability to market products that dont have guaranteed customers martin lin managing director of the rockwell collins china arm of rockwell collins inc of cedar rapids iowa which supplies avionics and cockpits for the arj said he believes china is technically capable of building larger planes "what i see lacking in technology is design for advanced engines and avionics systems for this type of aircraft to meet the requirements of the next or years " he said chinas low cost manufacturing advantage could be blunted by dependence on western avionics and engines according to an analysis by merrill lynch &amp co even for the body of the airplane airbus and boeing are in the midst of changing the game with a new generation of jets built largely from composites rather than aluminum these are expected to eclipse aluminum planes which require more maintenance and take longer to build efforts to obtain comment on chinas plane building project from a number of chinese government agencies or companies including avic i were unsuccessful selling such planes without a track record or reputation for customer service and support wont be easy chinese state run airlines are semi independent of the government and may not want to buy them foreign buyers could be even harder to find "the airlines are not picking a product theyre getting married to a supplier for a long long time " said mr craigs who has worked as a marketing executive for several european aviation companies in china
