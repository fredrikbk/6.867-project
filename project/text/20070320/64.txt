march tournament is really maddening but not the games the ncaa college basketball tournament began last week bringing office betting workplace tournament watching and frightful news releases "ncaa march madness strains employee productivity network bandwidth and security " thats news to colin glinsman the chief investment officer at an asset management firm has never seen evidence of employees distracted by the basketball games and until a few days ago had no idea what march madness meant "im glad i finally know " he says every year in the weeks before the ncaas basketball tournament consultants high tech executives and lawyers warn of its perils to the workplace betting pools leave companies legally exposed they say game video cripples office computer networks hackers can exploit fan interest corporations can suffer multibillion dollar productivity losses but the real madness of march is excessive fear mongering in the workplace where legions of employees dont know blue devils from buckeyes to them march madness has more to do with that unspeakable spring break in cancun for actual fans the tournament is simply this months distraction "people who are wasting time always find a golden opportunity to waste more " observes steve bosking a marketing director in reality march is pretty mild researchers birinyi associates found that big board trading volume during the busiest days of the tournament have been higher than average for the past years for plenty of people the ncaa games arent distracting in a recent survey workplace media found that of american workers wont be wagering in the office pool nearly half say they "have no interest in the tournament at all " that doesnt stop a raft of high tech companies from sounding alarms one etelemetry which makes network computers that track web surfing sent out a news release claiming companies "lose up to &# billion in lost wages" during the tournament the release touts that one of its customers "is raising its game" by using etelemetrys products to trace web usage "back to every staff member " but the customer that etelemetry cited the american association of airport executives uses the software for other more routine network management issues says patrick osborne senior vice president at the association he was unaware his company was mentioned in the release about march madness "im not doing anything different starting tomorrow than i did today " he says on the eve of the tournament similarly secure computing sent out a news release that online fraud is "expected in full force throughout this march madness season " during the super bowl a hacker hid malicious software on a football web site that gathered visitors personal information the company notes says dmitri alperovitch principal research scientist at secure computing "were almost certain theyre going to try to take advantage of events like march madness " another release for business service provider cbiz says one of its advisers can address "how companies can protect themselves from running afoul of the law" regarding betting pools "an office pool can qualify as an unlicensed gambling operation " notes attorney jennifer berman managing director at cbiz roughly two dozen states have strict laws making betting illegal thats scary sort of "ive never heard of these laws getting enforced " concedes ms berman still she says turning a blind eye to gambling while having written policies against it creates inconsistencies that can be legally problematic for companies though apparently less so for individuals "i ran my office pool in law school " she says sheepishly one of the biggest culprits in the scare is outplacement firm challenger gray &amp christmas which gives estimates of the value of lost productivity due to the tournament its latest figure &# billion is less than a third of last years estimate of &# billion which was four times the &# million estimated two years ago the latest swing is due to the firm considering for the first time the number of americans who have internet access at work even challenger whose figures have been criticized admits its productivity loss estimates are unscientific and "tongue in cheek " a spokesman says calling the productivity hit "disastrous" last year challenger concedes this year that of hr executives "do not consider the tournament a problem " "its a cost of doing business " says jason trennert a founder of an economic research firm and georgetown graduate "the chances of me not having one of their games on are about zero " others say high tech safeguards of productivity are just plain unproductive "the more you try to police it the more people spend their time trying to work their way around it " says automotive engineer jason rosenberger for eric smith a sales engineer who used to work at a company that had some rabid tournament fans march madness was welcome "when other folks are distracted by sports " he says "that means they arent bugging me " email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums to see past columns please go to careerjournal com
