global economy for india and china credit poses a challenge u s mortgage woes highlight pitfalls faced by two asian nations fledgling consumer lenders asias biggest nations are racing to build an american style consumer economy seeking to rev up consumer spending by promoting mortgages and other types of loans but in doing so they face a major challenge sidestepping the potential pitfalls of consumer credit in the u s consumer spending is the fuel that drives the economy by contrast asias major economies like china are powered mostly by exports and investment with a little government encouragement banks in china india and other asian countries are increasingly eager to put more spending power in consumers hands the idea is that providing consumer credit through mortgages credit cards and personal loans will encourage consumers to increase their spending helping to diversify asian economies the transition is likely to be a slow one even in countries such as india where individuals already play a big economic role consumer credit takes a back seat to cash transactions washington likes the consumer based strategy because making asia less dependent on exports might help reduce the huge u s trade deficit and could create new demand for u s goods but the transition doesnt come without risks even the u s with its more sophisticated financial system isnt immune to consumer credit woes last week asian markets felt a chill as investors started to wonder whether troubles in the u s market for subprime mortgages home loans made to consumers with poor or sketchy credit records could damp consumer confidence in the u s american consumers are the biggest source of demand for many of asias exports the turmoil in the u s has done little to diminish asias enthusiasm for the idea of promoting consumer credit to fuel economic growth but it does underscore the risks being sown in asias fast growing but relatively inexperienced consumer credit industries for example the region has little of the financial framework or legal infrastructure to deal with the kind of shakeout under way in the u s where dozens of subprime lenders have been forced to close their doors and some are considering filing for bankruptcy protection the good news is that the small scale so far of consumer lending in china and india means the economic fallout would be limited if banks in those countries were to suddenly get nervous about mortgage and other consumer lending and while both china and india have raised interest rates and otherwise sought to limit credit growth those moves have focused on corporate not individual borrowers in most of china mortgages have been available for less than a decade even at the nations biggest mortgage issuer china construction bank corp home loans make up less than of total loans helped by economic and income growth house prices have remained high which has kept defaults low indias mortgage market is even less developed in a nation of one billion people only five million home loans have been made in the past years mortgage loans make up only of the total lending at state bank of india the countrys largest bank in terms of assets icici bank indias second largest bank in terms of assets has been more aggressive in the retail market but its mortgage loans still make up only about of its total loans the bad news questionable loan policies abound suggesting that problems could be building up that might become serious somewhere down the line chinas bank regulators keep figures on most consumer lending activity under wraps so few know the real situation but abuse of credit is a particular concern in china where a dearth of data on individual borrowers means bankers often make lending decisions based on guesswork in just after auto loans were first introduced banks faced a wave of defaults as car buyers simply walked away from their vehicles more recently as the countrys stock market has soared in the past year chinese regulators have expressed concern that borrowed money is being funneled into the market some customers have refinanced their homes taken out personal loans or even borrowed against their credit cards to pay for stocks the government says fast growth in chinas mortgage industry could lead to future problems last month an official at the china banking regulatory commission told the state run xinhua news agency that as many as of mortgages scrutinized at certain banks in a recent probe were granted illegally often because collateral secures more than one property when official data have emerged however default rates are low the introduction of a credit culture hasnt always gone smoothly in asia a few years ago south korea partly under pressure from the u s sought to ease the nations reliance on exports by encouraging consumer spending in particular the government pushed credit card use for example by offering tax rebates on card debt but in only four years into the effort a wave of defaults began that nearly pushed the countrys biggest card issuer into bankruptcy and has left many consumers still trying to get out from under their bills
