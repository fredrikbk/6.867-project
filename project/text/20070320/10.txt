between classes getting ready for combat army by david axe the university of south carolina press pages &# forty nine forty nine forty nine " to this former rotc cadet and army officer david axes book on todays reserve officer training corps brought back some camouflage colored memories during regular physical fitness tests your chest was required to go so low during push ups that your upper arms were parallel to the ground and if you didnt go far enough down or if any part of your body wobbled the grader counting aloud would keep repeating the number of the last rep that lived up to his standards "forty nine forty nine forty nine " for me active duty turned out to offer nothing so viscerally frightening as those screaming sergeants thats exactly the point of rotc a program that for a few hours a week hammers some mental and physical toughness into collegians who are otherwise experiencing the most severe coddling of their lives mr axe who apparently spent hanging out with army rotc cadets from the university of south carolinas gamecock battalion the book contains no notes or acknowledgments is alert to that cultural tug of war for students considering rotc or their parents "army " is an honest compact briefing on the camaraderie and confidence building the lingo "theres just one thing that hooah definitely doesnt mean and thats no" the drudgery and the exhilaration of that first jump as the old army joke has it out of a perfectly good airplane despite the books subtitle "inside rotc at a time of war" mr axe hardly mentions what the cadets think of the war in iraq the danger it implies for them or the tactical aspects of learning counterinsurgency techniques versus the world war ii style maneuvers traditionally envisioned by rotc are these soldiers to be studying arabic are they reading the quran mr axe doesnt say as presented in "army " the cadets concerns about passing land navigation or practicing building rope bridges could have been recorded in the late s when i was in the program such an avoidance of larger questions limits the books appeal as does mr axes prose a mix of cliches "hes been there done that " "last but not least " "thats no picnic" and an affected breeziness seemingly derived from gomer pyle "yessiree " "shape up or ship out" mr axes habit of paraphrasing instead of quoting has the effect of muddying what should be clear and tends to turn the cadets into mere types the goofball who treats training as a joke the outsider longing to fit in somewhere the cadet afraid of heights who goes to jump school the army brat whose military career was "always a foregone conclusion " the cadets choices of words are suspiciously similar to the authors and it sometimes isnt easy to guess whether mr axe or one of his subjects is talking either the author or a disgruntled ex cadet thinks the army is in the business of "sacrificing thousands of young men and women to the imperialistic ambitions of a corrupt president " at another point it is clearly mr axe who says "west point produces the armys grunts and professional automatons " such casual fragging distracts mr axe from the big juicy topics such as the role of women in the military mr axe declares that women are being mistreated by being barred from the combat branches though even he notices that rotc women are forever falling out of run formations or requiring rescue at an obstacle when a female cadet flunks out of airborne school because she cant do a single pull up but remains on track to become an army officer mr axe uncritically relays her rationalizations "all those years of soccer have given her a strong lower body at the expense of her arms and back " he writes as though upper and lower body strength were a zero sum game he also maintains that "pull ups require expensive and bulky equipment " apparently not having checked out the &# pull up bar sold on amazon com mr axe reckons that women should be allowed in the infantry because "iraqi insurgents dont care what branch youre in " picture the young woman who couldnt raise her own weight a few inches off the ground trying to drag a wounded pound soldier out of the line of fire in a baghdad street and you might draw a different conclusion in the new era of counterinsurgency the army must be more vigilant about physical ineptitude not less sergeants scream for a reason mr smith an army veteran of the gulf war is the author of the novel "love monkey "
