student debt congress seeks to ease burden host of bills would free up more money slash rates forgiving loans after years high school seniors college students and recent graduates have some powerful new cheerleaders in washington lawmakers from both parties as well as president bush are all scrambling to find ways to make higher education more affordable in a blizzard of bills and proposals in recent months they are looking to slash loan rates tie repayment to graduates income to help students who choose low paying fields sweeten grants for less affluent scholars encourage students to borrow directly from the government and improve disclosure about loan terms to students and their families as much as anything happening on capitol hill the rising fortunes of college students show the impact of the new democratic control of the house and senate last year the republican led congress cut nearly &# billion from student lending programs as part of a deficit reduction act now lawmakers are planning to do the opposite as they confront an alarming trend as college tuition continues to skyrocket the median bachelors degree recipient is leaving school with &# in debt and students can end up owing several times that sum after they complete their graduate education christine moellenberndt who is studying for her masters degree in anthropology at the new school for social research in new york city has &# in student loans including &# from her undergraduate studies at the university of california santa cruz ms moellenberndt years old wants to teach at a community college but she worries she may have to change her plans so she can afford to pay her debt "i try not to think about it too often " she says of her loans "its very scary and its very depressing to me i know that with this amount of debt i may never be able to afford a house ever " legislators want to help students like ms moellenberndt but theres a catch they dont want to bust the federal budget with the government already doling out more than &# billion annually in grants loans and other federal aid sweetening the pot could be costly to avoid raising taxes or cutting other programs democrats and republicans are targeting federal payments to big lenders including student loan giant slm corp commonly known as sallie mae the federal government pays these lenders billions of dollars in subsidies so they can make government backed student loans at attractive rates although these companies have been big republican financial patrons they are now under assault from all quarters for their hefty profits they are also under investigation by new york attorney general andrew cuomo who last week accused them of paying kickbacks and offering improper inducements including trips to the caribbean for college financial aid officers and striking deals that may not be in students best interests the industry denies any impropriety congress is also considering increased disclosure of the financial arrangements between colleges and lenders in his recent budget president bush has proposed cutting subsidies and other benefits to lenders by at least &# billion over five years sen edward kennedy the massachusetts democrat who heads up the senate committee on health education labor and pensions is considering slashing even more for its part the financial industry is trying to fight back arguing that cuts could drive some lenders out of the business reduce competition and damage customer service thousands of lenders now offer student loans and often grant discounts from government mandated rates "its going to hurt schools its going to hurt students " says tom joyce spokesman for sallie mae congressional aides industry officials and financial aid experts say the following five proposals are getting the most serious consideration though it could be months before lawmakers take final action increasing pell grants last year the government gave out &# billion worth of pell grants which dont require repayment to more than five million students from lower income families but the size of the grants hasnt kept pace with rising tuition costs president bush has proposed increasing the maximum pell grant from &# to &# in and to &# in sen kennedy is expected to ask for even higher levels the five year cost of the presidents proposal &# billion prospects excellent since helping low income students has broad support from democrats and republicans and faces no industry opposition cutting stafford loan interest rates the house passed a bill to cut in half over time the interest rates on certain loans in the popular stafford program to from the proposal would apply only to students of lower income families eligible for the most heavily subsidized stafford loans in which the government pays the interest while students are in school last year more than five million students took out these loans lawmakers said the cut once fully phased in would save a typical borrower with &# in debt &# over the life of their loan but mark kantrowitz publisher of finaid org a financial aid web site takes issue with that estimate and says the true savings could be about half that amount or even less cost &# billion prospects mixed at least in its present form republicans and even some advocates for students and financial aid officers note that few students decide whether to go to college based on interest rates and that the benefits would also flow to students who end up getting high paying jobs after graduation and could easily repay the loans tying loan repayment to income sen kennedy is proposing a plan that would give students some breathing room if they take low paying jobs when they graduate with high debts this "income contingent" approach would cap repayment at of monthly income after food and rent costs the government would pay the interest above that amount for college graduates in certain public sector fields such as teaching social work and law enforcement the loans would be forgiven after years cost still unclear but senate aides give a rough estimate of &# billion to &# billion over five years for the "income contingent" piece alone prospects mixed republicans worry about the cost and potential for abuse of the program though they are looking more favorably on the one targeted toward public service jobs sen mike enzi of wyoming the ranking republican on the education committee says he also wants congress to push for ways to get colleges to keep prices down such as more disclosure of the reasons behind tuition increases instead of only providing more money for loans and grants cutting out private lenders sen kennedy is pushing hard to encourage schools to use a program in which students borrow directly from the federal government rather than through big commercial banks and sallie mae which receive federal subsidy payments government studies have found that the u s department of educations direct loan program is cheaper for taxpayers but most schools opt for private lenders under this new plan schools that switch to the direct program would receive half of the savings they generate for the government in the form of financial aid for lower income students potentially several hundred dollars a year apiece according to democratic aides prospects mixed many republicans are leery of expanding a government program and lenders say the savings are illusory because they dont take into account government administrative and other costs additionally many colleges are happy with the status quo increasing loan scrutiny sen kennedy favors beefed up disclosure of the little understood relationship between college financial aid offices and lenders colleges often put certain lenders on their "preferred" lists democrats want a measure that would force disclosure of these deals the kind under scrutiny by mr cuomo in new york to guard against kickbacks to schools and other potential abuses the bill would ban lender gifts worth more than &# the measure would also require schools to offer at least three lenders to promote competition and it would force finance firms that sell nongovernment loans directly to college students rather than through financial aid offices to notify colleges of the offers that way colleges could inform students of potentially cheaper government backed alternatives prospects despite some resistance from some lenders and colleges few in washington will be likely to argue against disclosure though the industry may complain about the paperwork burden loan rangers congress is pushing to make college more affordable among the proposals gaining steam increasing the maximum pell grant amounts for low income families cutting rates on
