road to damascus how beirut police fingered syria in hariri assassination despite leads probe hindered by threats u n tribunal is urged beirut lebanon after a lb bomb killed former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri on feb beirut police detectives quickly found key evidence was disappearing from the crime scene a security detail carted away the charred remnants of mr hariris convoy according to lebanese officers a bulldozer started filling the crater left by the blast for three weeks nobody bothered to seal off the site "the crime scene was totally compromised " says maj gen achraf rifi who today heads lebanons police called the internal security forces now two years later the investigation is reaching a critical stage despite the obstacles united nations and lebanese detectives developed a prime suspect lebanons powerful neighbor syria the u s sensing a chance to pressure syria and its ally iran is pushing lebanon to approve a u n tribunal to try suspects in the case the pro western government of prime minister fuad siniora wants a vote this week in parliament on the tribunal the case has stirred up deep animosities in this fractured society leading many to worry that lebanon could tip back into civil war undoing strides toward democracy in recent years since december the militant force hezbollah has been mobilizing protesters sometimes numbering in the hundreds of thousands in daily demonstrations in beirut hezbollah leaders say they are merely trying to obtain a fair representation in lebanons cabinet but others see efforts to shield syria a major hezbollah patron from the hariri probe historically an overpowering presence here neighboring syria controlled virtually all lebanons security forces including the interior ministry whose forces carried out the premature cleanup of the crime scene syrian dictator bashar assad had recently tangled with mr hariri a string of tantalizing clues seemed to suggest a syrian hand in the murder moreover both witnesses and investigators have come under vicious attack by unknown assassins imad moustapha the syrian ambassador to washington dismisses allegations that syria was involved in the hariri killing or any of the other politically motivated murders or attempts while pledging his governments support for the u n s probe if it isnt "politicized " "we accept that the united states is trying to use the investigation to blackmail syria " he said in an interview the ambassador also joined other syrian officials in saying damascus is open to cooperating with the u s in lebanon iraq and the palestinian territories much of modern lebanon formed part of a "greater syria" throughout the years of the ottoman empire and a portion of the french colonial era and though paris granted lebanon independence in syrian troops deployed in lebanon from the mid s through as part of internationally sanctioned bids to end the countrys sectarian wars leaders in damascus used compliant local politicians to determine virtually every major political decision inside lebanon and to run beiruts military and intelligence services in late february the first small group of u n investigators arrived to help with the probe the u n team which over two years grew to more than was initially headed by german prosecutor detlev mehlis it took up headquarters in an aging hotel set in the hills above beirut security was tight the u n kept such a close eye on the comings and goings of its staff that some half jokingly called the place "guantanamo bay " a reference to the high security u s detention facility for suspected terrorists by march growing outrage over mr hariris death sent nearly one million lebanese onto the streets of central beirut and forced syrian president assad to withdraw his troops from lebanon in late april elections free of syrian influence brought to power a government headed by mr hariris closest allies and gen rifi took over as isf commander gen rifi played a leading role in pursuing the investigation reporting directly to mr mehlis during the probes first six months a year veteran of the isf gen rifi headed the isfs counternarcotics and special investigation units and keenly understood lebanons fractious political and religious divisions the tripoli native was close to mr hariri and once headed the prime ministers security detail freed from damascuss yoke gen rifis men worked with their u n counterparts to pick up important leads into the hariri case that had previously been ignored by pro syrian intelligence agents a principal area of focus was the widening political feud that developed between messrs hariri and assad during the last months of the lebanese leaders life syrias president had grown convinced according to u n reports and mr hariris aides that lebanons prime minister was working with the u s and france to weaken damascus and liberate lebanon the tensions came to a head according to these sources when the prime minister publicly broke with mr assads decision to extend the term of lebanese president emile lahoud a former general who was close to the syrians convening a minute meeting in damascus on aug mr assad told mr hariri that he would "break lebanon" on mr hariris head if he didnt support the syrian presidents decision concerning mr lahoud according to mr hariris aides according to a u n report syrias top intelligence chief in lebanon at the time rustum ghazali told a senior lebanese official in an intercepted telephone conversation that mr hariri would be forced "to resign like a dog" for betraying president assad mr hariri did ultimately resign in october of four months before his death today saad hariri the late leaders year old son sees such evidence as proof that syrias president ordered the attack "who killed rafik hariri it was the syrian regime " he says from his familys well protected compound in west beirut as the investigation pushed ahead u n and lebanese detectives ratcheted up forensic work they began to trace the ownership of a white mitsubishi van that they suspected had held the car bomb and to work on identifying the suspected suicide bomber they also traced the whereabouts of a palestinian man who had claimed responsibility for the attack in a videotape released the afternoon of mr hariris murder some of mr rifis detectives took a fresh look at phone records that had been gathered showing telecommunications traffic in the sectors near the blast site on the day of the attack in particular the u n believes users of six phones with prepaid cards were actively tracing mr hariris motorcade many of these numbers were then in touch with officials either in or close to the top of lebanese and syrian security services with syrias withdrawal in april a growing number of eyewitnesses also began providing information some talked of road work being done at the crime site days before the attack possibly installing equipment to aid the bombing other witnesses spoke of attending planning meetings with top lebanese and syrian generals based in part on this evidence mr mehlis recommended in august the arrest of four lebanese generals including gen rifis predecessor as isf commander gen ali hajj for their alleged role in the attack one evening that august gen rifi gathered his men in secret to tell them about the planned arrests he ordered them to act in the early morning due to fears that the suspects might try to flee or fight back after rounding up the generals gen rifis men detained some in their own homes outside beirut to diminish their ability to coordinate a response they temporarily housed gen hajj in the basement of isf headquarters before transferring him to a maximum security prison "its hard to work against your own in many ways we werent really prepared for this task " gen rifi acknowledges but he adds that the arrests were aimed as a signal to syria and others that the u n and beiruts new government were serious about following through with the investigation in october the u n released its first report on the hariri murder which directly implicated senior lebanese and syrian intelligence officials the report argued that "it would be difficult to envisage a scenario whereby such a complex assassination plot could have been carried out" without the knowledge of syrias and lebanons intelligence agencies despite these successes gen rifi and the other investigators ran into serious new challenges as the probe progressed two initial key witnesses including self described syrian intelligence agents recanted or altered their testimonies other critical witnesses and suspects in damascus stonewalled when u n investigators sought to interview them even some lebanese began questioning the legality of the u n s mandate indeed the detaining of the four generals without any formal charges has fed charges within lebanon that the hariri probe contravenes national laws hezbollah and its political allies have held up authorization of the international court on similar grounds from her apartment above the mediterranean samar hajj wife of the imprisoned gen ali hajj says the government was using the case to further its political agenda she notes that her husband a sunni like mr hariri also worked on the prime ministers security detail "why would he kill rafik hariri he loves him " she says just an hour after her weekly prison visit mr mehlis the german prosecutor denies any political motives "i suggested the arrests to the lebanese authorities based on the evidence we had in hand " mr mehlis said "i acted no differently than i would have on any case in germany " he said more worrisome as lebanon and the u n moved to establish an international court to try mr hariris assassins the violence against those involved in or supporting the probe picked up a car bomb struck and injured a traditionally pro syrian politician lebanese defense minister elias murr in july after his offices began cooperating with investigators five months later gebran tueni an anti syrian politician and journalist was killed by a car bomb while navigating a mountain road on the same day the u n released its second report alleging damascuss complicity in the assassination mr tueni had served as a witness for the u n and his newspaper an nahar has been among the most vocal in the arab world calling for syrias withdrawal from lebanon gen rifis investigators have also come under attack last summer one of his top detectives working on the case capt wissam eid was in the bathroom of his home in a beirut suburb when a knock came at his front door when he answered a grenade exploded seriously injuring his hands though capt eid survived shortly after the attack the isfs chief investigator on the case lt col samir shehade and his staff issued an arrest warrant for an arab man suspected of involvement in the hariri murder and two other attacks on anti syrian officials days before police were to make the arrest the suspect fled to syria after getting word that his fiancee had been arrested on sept a few days after the suspect had fled col shehades caravan was winding its way along a mountain road toward isf headquarters from his home when a remote controlled fragmentation bomb exploded the blast instantly killed four of the detectives bodyguards and seriously injured col shehade he flew to montreal for medical treatment and has yet to return due to security concerns "we made this breakthrough so they tried to kill shehade " gen rifi says so far police havent found who was behind these attacks but like many other people the police chief says he suspects syrian involvement damascus denies the allegation gen rifis forces have arrested a handful of people entering lebanon from syria in recent months who he describes as sunni militants seeking to attack u n staff meanwhile the investigators are pushing ahead on what they say are key pieces of remaining evidence the detectives have tracked the movement of the mitsubishi van that blew up here it passed from japan through the united arab emirates to the northern lebanese town of tripoli investigators have surmised from dna samples that the suicide bomber wasnt a native of lebanon and the u n may be able to trace him to another middle eastern country based on the amount of lead in his body in a report released friday the u n s new chief investigator serge brammertz said he was increasingly focusing on mr hariris efforts to defuse political tensions in lebanon during his last weeks alive the former belgian prosecutor said there was a possibility that the assassination plot was under way even as "hariri was engaged in rapprochement initiatives" with damascus despite apparent progress some investigators fear they wont get the chance to complete their probe they worry that syria might get a free pass from western governments on the hariri matter in exchange for helping to settle the violence in iraq some lebanese are also beginning to question whether finding mr hariris killers is worth the prospects of a new civil war prime minister siniora vows to press on "what we are after is to know" who perpetrated this crime says mr siniora in an interview from his downtown office just blocks from where mr hariri was killed "this will prevent similar attacks from happening in the future " david crawford in berlin
