sign up for the e mail here the fifth year of the war in iraq has begun with todays execution of taha yassin ramadan a former vice president of saddam hussein but mr ramadans hanging even less than his bosss did little to divert the worlds attention from a conflict with no apparent end in sight mr ramadan had been sentenced to life for the governments massacre of shiite muslims in the s only to see an appeals panel appointed by the now shiite led government increase the penalty to death as the bbc reports iraqi officials say they were careful to avoid the verbal abuse that marred mr husseins hanging and the technical mistakes that led to another codefendants decapitation in january early media reports today were already paying more attention to todays anniversary of the invasion with the associated press for example noting that "many of those serving in the iraq war as it enters a fifth year were in high school when it began " about one in eight of the u s troops who have rotated through iraq are younger than years old the ap adds and more than half are under so its understandable why the latest white house fact sheet on the war is entitled "four years later new strategy requires patience and determination " president bushs eight minute anniversary speech yesterday focused on accomplishments like the removal of mr hussein and reiterated the need to press on lest a u s withdrawal engender greater pandemonium in the region and threaten the u s "the terrorists could emerge from the chaos with a safe haven in iraq to replace the one they had in afghanistan which they used to plan the attacks of september the th " mr bush said again bending to his argument and underlining what has been his most consistent justification for the war over the past four plus years but his description of the most pressing u s goal in iraq suggested how much american expectations have changed in that time "at this point in the war our most important mission is helping the iraqis secure their capital " mr bush said adding that political reconciliation and economic rebuilding wont make progress "until baghdads citizens feel secure in their own homes and neighborhoods " walter russell mead of the council on foreign relations who also opposes a u s withdrawal nonetheless acknowledged the tough arguments facing the president "four years after a war when you say that our goal is to safeguard the capital your allies this doesnt if abraham lincoln had to had to say in our goal is to prevent washington from falling to the confederate forces it wouldnt look good for him " mr mead said on the "newshour with jim lehrer" "people are tired of the war and yet at this point its hard to see an alternative at least in the short term to continuing with trying at least to stabilize baghdad " the white house fact sheet emphasis on the joint iraqi american security stations at the heart of the baghdad effort add to the doubts fears and distrust built up among iraqis since "make it difficult if not impossible to persuade iraqis to use the stations as they were intended as friendly neighborhood cop shops where anyone can drop by with a tip on a suspected terrorist next door " the los angeles times says "it is a country where people have little faith in the u s militarys commitment to providing them the electricity jobs and improved lives they were promised as part of the american led attack " a new poll of iraqis sponsored by usa today abc news the bbc and german tv network ard of iraqis found "disillusionment about the countrys political future and opposition among shiites and sunni arabs to u s forces deployed there " usa today says a majority of kurds still supports democracy but a majority of sunni arabs favors having a strongman with life long rule and shiites are "split between a democracy and an islamic state ruled by religious principles " among respondents supported a unified iraq but the same amount predicted iraq will be more divided within five years the fight over war funds on the hill mr bush recounted his teleconference yesterday morning with iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki the white house released a photo of the president and vice president dick cheney waving to their counterparts in baghdad and praised the iraqis for their commitments to make his new plans work he then chided members of congress for putting at risk u s commitments by including in a war spending bill calls for a timetable for withdrawal next year "they have a responsibility to get this bill to my desk without strings and without delay " he said "they have a responsibility to pass a clean bill that does not use funding for our troops as leverage to get special interest spending for their districts " but the bill does indeed have what the washington post describes as "billions in federal funds for lawmakers pet projects large and small to secure enough votes this week to pass" the iraq funding bill that includes reconstruction of new orleans levees and the building of peanut storehouses in georgia yet the projects "have had little impact on the tally " the post says with at least eight democrats poised to vote against it house democratic leaders are "scrambling to convince rank and file members" to back it the hill reports barclays closer to a deal for abn amro dutch bank abn amro and british counterpart barclays acknowledged they have gone ahead and begun a day period of "early and exploratory" if exclusive merger talks as the financial times reports "a deal would be europes largest cross border transaction to date and transform the continents banking landscape " the ft notes it "would combine the dutch banks operations in brazil the u s the middle east and asia with barclays expertise in investment banking fund management and credit cards " such a deal an acquisition for more than &# billion has been in the works before but foundered the wall street journal says but if it goes through the european giant would be better positioned to compete with global banks in the u s and asia still "big global banks have had a mixed record often proving less nimble than smaller more focused competitors " the journal adds "but a deal likely would prompt big rivals like citigroup bank of america banco santander central hispano and hsbc holdings to reassess their own global strategies " medicare faulted for not punishing tax scofflaws the u s government may change how medicare pays for treatment of older americans in the wake of a government accountability office investigation that found the health care system had no mechanism to withhold payments from doctors who havent paid federal taxes the gao "found that more than providers of medicares physician and outpatient services failed to pay more than &# billion in taxes owed through september " the wall street journal reports "gao said those medicare providers failed to pay &# million in payroll taxes &# million in individual income taxes and &# million in other taxes such as corporate income and employment taxes " individual descriptions of the tax abuse were of the outrageous variety that usually puts pressure on lawmakers to demand changes "many of these individuals accumulated substantial wealth and assets including million dollar houses and luxury vehicles while failing to pay their federal taxes " the investigators said according to the new york times "one physician gambled millions of dollars at the same time the individual owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal taxes " russia gives iran ultimatum over enrichment american european and iranian officials tell the new york times that russia has given iran an ultimatum suspend enrichment of uranium as the united nations security council demands or moscow will withhold nuclear fuel for the nearly completed bushehr power plant it helped to build last month russia said it would delay shipment of uranium in a dispute over payment but the times says igor s ivanov secretary of the russian national security council personally delivered a much stronger message to irans deputy chief nuclear negotiator in moscow last week "were not sure what mix of commercial and political motives are at play here " one senior bush administration official tells the times "but clearly the russians and the iranians are getting on each others nerves and thats not all bad " a senior european official adds "we consider this a very important decision by the russians it shows that our disagreements with the russians about the dangers of irans nuclear program are tactical fundamentally the russians dont want a nuclear iran " also of note washington post a federal appeals court thwarted attempts by a group of enron investors to sue investment banks over their role in the houston energy traders collapse giving wall street a powerful weapon to defend itself against future claims by essentially postponing a &# billion class action case that was expected to go
