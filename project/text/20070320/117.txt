the bloomberg calendar california decided last week to move its presidential primary next year to february from june joining eight other states that will hold primaries or caucuses on that early date at least eight more are expected to follow meaning that republicans and democrats could have their nominees all but selected nine months before novembers election this is unfortunate for many reasons not least because this accelerated process assists the well known and well heeled candidates who can raise boatloads of money in advance yes some darkhorse could still win in the iowa caucuses january or the new hampshire primary january gaining free publicity going into "super duper tuesday " but a genuine upset winner will also find it hard to raise enough cash to compete in so many large states so quickly elites favor early endgames of course as a way to unify party support but heres a thought what if the process serves to favor someone else namely a billionaire who wants to run as an independent its possible that both major party nominees could emerge from their accelerated primaries so bruised and with such high negatives that the voters will already be feeling buyers remorse then someone like new york mayor michael bloomberg could decide to get into the race spend &# million of his own money and truly remake the presidential race were not endorsing the idea and we prefer the primary system in which voters vet the candidates but such a scenario could well be the unintended consequence of the parties attempts to get things over so very fast see related letter "letters to the editor its all over mike" wsj march
