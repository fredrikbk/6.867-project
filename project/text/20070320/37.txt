enterprise immigrants gain edge doing business back home knowledge of culture personal connections help to open doors for immigrant entrepreneurs building a business in the u s can be fraught with risks financial uncertainties and huge learning curves but for some help in achieving that american dream can be found back home that may mean exporting u s made goods to their native countries or bringing products and services from those countries to the u s but for these entrepreneurs doing business with their native countries provides them with competitive advantages that many of their domestic rivals lack they know the language culture and market immigrant entrepreneurs also may have familial and educational relationships that could help them find suppliers and customers and even personal ties to government officials that could help open some doors "selling back to their lands where you have cultural knowledge is a logical thing to do " says marcia drew hohn director of public education at the immigrant learning center inc in malden mass which has done research on the connection between immigrant entrepreneurship and neighborhood revitalization but knowing the country isnt going to make up for some of the basic problems that entrepreneurs will have to deal with in doing business in some countries ms hohn says immigrant business owners also need to consider the level of governmental support for businesses as well as the banking system tax implications corruption and crime heres a look at three immigrant entrepreneurs whose experiences highlight the ups and downs of doing business in ones native land tracy nguyen came to the u s in as a teenage vietnam war refugee she earned a degree in electrical engineering and established a career in the field then in with little working capital limited english and no pharmacy degree she started affordable quality pharmaceuticals of garden grove calif the employee company which had revenue of &# million last year buys large quantities of brand name and generic prescription drugs repackages and sells them in smaller packages for retail pharmacies in the u s then on a visit back to vietnam in ms nguyen noticed that the vietnamese government was opening up and was welcoming foreign companies and was giving incentives for pharmaceutical and biotechnology investments the year old entrepreneur says since she knew the language and had wanted to get into the business of pharmaceuticals it was her grandfathers dying wish for her before she left for america she decided in to set up a biotech company in vietnam to make diagnostic tests such as those for pregnancy and ovulation but despite pouring nearly &# into the company over two years and getting incentives from the government including tax breaks and cheap leases ms nguyen decided it was too hard to run the business on her own among the setbacks difficulty finding capable workers and dealing with red tape she says the final straw was an incident in which it took her two months to get a license notarized and approved by different consulates flying back and forth between vietnam and the u s so she changed her business model to a licensing agreement in a cooperative alliance among several vietnamese pharmaceutical firms her company is now widely known by the pharmaceutical industry there and she maintains close ties with the head of the ministry of health she says the lessons learned and connections made from this venture helped her other company aqp land a three year contract last november with the centers for disease control and prevention to provide basic medicine cabinet supplies in vietnam the contract gives aqp the rights to subcontract the manufacturing of generic drugs like aspirin to vietnamese companies store them centrally and distribute them to local hospitals she says aqp is the only u s based pharmaceutical company licensed in vietnam to buy and sell drugs there rakesh kamdar built up his business by tapping a resource in his home land that is in great demand elsewhere in the world mr kamdar came to the u s in to pursue a masters in computer science in early he started his own business but not in it instead he created db healthcare inc a company that supplies indian nurses to the u s mr kamdar says he knew the demand for nurses was great and immediately saw a business opportunity in looking at his native country for potential recruits his venture was facilitated by the fact that he knew why most companies that had previously tried to recruit nurses in india failed he says those companies arrived in india and advertised in newspapers to get nurses to attend seminars in five star hotels that may work for it people he says but its not common for women in india to attend events like these alone and since most nurses come from middle class families they typically arent exposed to such luxurious environments but they did show up to his meetings thats because he invited the nurses as well as their husbands parents and in laws for informational interviews at the companys local offices he and his staff not only addressed individual concerns but family questions as well "we are able to lock in the whole family " he says mr kamdar says db healthcare which recorded &# million in revenue last year gets most of its recruits from employee referrals thanks to information from friends back in india and some help from the u s government jamal qureshi later this year will start supplying medical equipment to a training hospital in the town where he was born in mr qureshi started jq american corp a hayward calif export company that mainly sells bundled heavy equipment to the oil and refinery industries and over the years he has gotten assistance from the u s export assistance center in oakland calif a branch office of the u s commercial service which helps small and midsize businesses get their goods and services sold abroad then during a visit to india in a former high school classmate told him that a medical school and hospital was being built in bhopal his home town and it needed medical equipment mr qureshi decided that he could supply the equipment and quickly contacted the u s export assistance center for help with the negotiations mr qureshi whose company made &# million in revenue last year says "to cross barriers and to have that support is amazing "
