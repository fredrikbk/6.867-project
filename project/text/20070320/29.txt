delta ceo to forgo extra payout post bankruptcy plan compensates managers nonunion workers instead delta air lines inc says chief executive gerald grinstein wont be pocketing any extra money not a dollar in cash not a share of stock when the atlanta carrier emerges from bankruptcy court protection later this spring with a projected stock value of &# billion typically executives receive big payouts after such restructurings as a reward for slashing costs during bankruptcy proceedings and sticking around through turmoil that usually renders their prebankruptcy protection shares worthless such payments often are widely criticized as undeserved windfalls especially by employees who lose their jobs and shareholders who see much of their own prebankruptcy stakes plunge in value but in details of its postbankruptcy compensation plan that delta plans to file today the company says the year old mr grinstein who has been deltas ceo since january will receive no additional salary bonus stock or other compensation he will continue to collect his current base salary of &# but plans to step down as soon as a successor is named by deltas post bankruptcy board probably this summer according to company officials instead deltas plan calls for the distribution of an estimated &# million to about nonunionized employees and managers within to months of the companys exit from bankruptcy proceedings additionally seven delta executives below mr grinstein stand to get several million dollars each in stock related compensation but only if delta hits profit targets that trigger profit sharing payouts promised to rank and file workers "im the dawning of the old age " mr grinstein said when asked why he decided not to seek a postbankruptcy proceedings payout delta he said is "a terrific company and i wanted to see it succeed if i could help " since delta entered bankruptcy proceedings in september mr grinstein has overseen an aggressive makeover designed to keep the airline independent folding its popular discount brand song into the main airline negotiating massive pay concessions and operational cuts and unexpectedly launching a dramatic expansion of service to international locations during bankruptcy proceedings delta has squeezed &# billion in annual costs and cut about jobs though late last year it recalled more than flight attendants pilots and others furloughed as far back as bringing the employee total to roughly it has cut other worker costs too for instance by switching their pensions to a cheaper k plan that in many cases offers lower benefits than its predecessor at the same time amid widespread cuts in capacity across the airline industry deltas fares increased and its load factors the percentage of seats filled on each flight rose quickly delta reported its most crowded flights in years in and its first full year operating profit since it expects to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings as the second largest u s airline in stock market value behind southwest airlines co delta also fended off a &# billion hostile takeover bid by us airways group inc in late january which many industry analysts thought it couldnt resist but employees and congressional allies rallied to mr grinsteins side and he won over the airlines largest creditors including the pilots union with whom delta had long had a cantankerous relationship ultimately the bid collapsed as key delta creditors expressed greater confidence in the companys business strategy than in taking cash and stock in the smaller bidder the move by mr grinstein likely doesnt signal a wider trend in bankruptcy related compensation he doesnt need the millions he likely is passing up thanks to a fortune he has accumulated in his business career mr grinstein engineered the sale of western airlines to delta in and later became ceo of burlington northern inc where he oversaw the railroads acquisition of santa fe pacific corp in he also co founded madrona venture group a seattle based venture capital fund that invested in dozens of technology companies and start ups mostly in the pacific northwest while at delta mr grinstein has presented himself as a sharp departure from the companys past criticizing prior managements mistakes such as special executive pensions created in that were denounced by employees forced to endure layoffs and pay cuts mr grinsteins own delta shares which he said were once worth about &# million will be canceled as part of the bankruptcy the proposed compensation structure which must be approved by delta creditors isnt a "reward for the past " mr grinstein said yesterday "you have got to have a program that attracts executives but at the same time youve got to take care of the relationships with front line employees " the postbankruptcy compensation plan also reflects one of deltas primary goals to restructure compensation so that future profits are spread more widely and equitably among airline personnel "these are the people that built a &# billion valuation company from the rubble " ed bastian deltas chief financial officer said in an interview current pay levels at delta near the bottom of the u s airline industry are "untenable " he said nonmanagement employees at delta will get of the companys new shares valued at &# million by the airline based on an estimated share price of &# apiece the same employee group also would get a lump sum cash payment of &# million &# million in retirement contributions &# million in pay increases and another &# million if delta hits certain operational performance targets this year a previously announced profit sharing plan would give employees an additional &# million in next years first quarter if delta remains on track to meet its financial targets pilots arent included because their union struck a separate deal that includes a stake in the airline people familiar with the plan said it was explicitly designed with the goal of surpassing compensation given to employees in previous airline bankruptcies delta officials sought to build on recent employee solidarity and wanted a pay structure that would dissuade nonunion workers from unionizing preserving a largely nonunion work force is a critical component in deltas mission to raise revenue and profits while managing labor costs deltas creditors initially were skeptical of approving the payouts to the employees because they arent required to be compensated in the plan according to people familiar with the negotiations but these people said delta convinced the creditors that doing so was essential not only to prevent unionization and control costs but to ensure flexibility to change routes and scheduling two keys to deltas long term recovery "that was a concern since the bankruptcy filing " said bill morey a member of the delta board council which represents nonpilot employees "the board council talked to jerry about that he knew wed have to try that and anything else would not be fair from the employee point of view " mr bastian and jim whitehurst deltas chief operating officer will get no raises but each would get an estimated &# million in restricted stock stock options and other performance based shares if delta hits its financial targets messrs bastian and whitehurst are considered the leading internal candidates to succeed mr grinstein as ceo five executive vice presidents would get &# million each deltas next top managers would get a combined stake in the airline in comparison ual corp s united airlines emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in
