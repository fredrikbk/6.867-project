can giulianis name turn buzz into money former mayor opens doors for law firm in new york but jury out on rainmaking whats rudy giulianis name worth as political operators size up that question for the presidential race a law firm in texas faced it two years ago in a more mundane context whether signing up the former new york city mayor would rope in enough business to justify the costs to partners in houston the firm then known as bracewell &amp patterson llp took on mr giuliani as partner changed its name to bracewell &amp giuliani llp opened a manhattan office and took losses of about &# million to boost the cachet of the under the radar regional firm as patrick oxford bracewells managing partner says with mr giuliani aboard fewer potential clients now ask "who in the hell are these guys " that profile will only get bigger as mr giuliani pursues the presidency what is less clear is whether all that attention will pay off financially while mr giuliani has attracted lawyers to the office and used his celebrity and connections to get the firm meetings it might not otherwise have his rainmaking abilities are harder to assess the firm wont identify new clients mr giuliani has brought in "ive met with a lot of new prospective clients of which many have turned into clients " mr giuliani says also declining to name names mr giuliani by all accounts does little actual lawyering the new york office which opened in may and now includes about lawyers is still a losing proposition mr oxford says the office lost &# million to &# million less than expected last year and maintains that by the end of the office will be operating at a profit startup costs are steep for any firm in new york jenner &amp block llp for example opened in new york in late and has yet to cross the profit threshold says partner ronald marmer corporate law firms have long linked up with ex politicos in the hopes that their name recognition contacts and experience in the halls of government will lead to business just this month chadbourne &amp parke llp hired new yorks former governor george pataki former ohio congressman michael oxley joined baker hostetler llp in washington and yesterday pittsburgh based eckert seamans cherin &amp mellott llc announced the hiring of former pennsylvania senator rick santorum the hires can pay off for firms as political figures often can get their phone calls returned and possess a "keen insight" into how the regulatory process works says william perlstein co chairman of wilmer cutler pickering hale &amp dorr llp which has about lawyers with government experience "but the presence of a political figure alone is not going to be sufficient to handle top level work " mr perlstein says "you need to have an experienced group working with that person " the bracewell giuliani hookup built in far greater expectations on bracewells part than just adding another well connected lawyer aligning with mr giuliani provided a way for bracewell to tackle an ever difficult problem for regional law firms trying to break out nationally how to build a presence in the lucrative but also competitive and expensive new york legal market "from a texas point of view coming to new york is a big big step" for bracewell says mr giuliani who has worked at top new york firms in between government service "a lot of firms have failed " with roughly lawyers bracewell has operations in washington and other locations energy companies and banks represent a significant part of the firms client base it opened an office in kazakhstan in to service oil producers and their lenders in the caspian sea region bracewell also has a significant business representing local school districts in texas but in size and profitability partner salaries averaged &# last year according to the firm bracewell ranks behind some of the leading texas firms such as baker botts llp home to former secretary of state james a baker iii "before rudy giuliani joined bracewell was a solid but sleepy midsized texas firm " says thomas ajamie of houstons ajamie llp "giuliani injected adrenaline into the blood system there " talks between bracewell which has a cadre of partners with deep ties to the republican party and giuliani started in roy bailey a houstonian and a managing director of mr giulianis security consulting firm giuliani partners llc introduced mr giuliani to the firms managing partner mr oxford an influential republican who served as a volunteer organizer for president bushs reelection campaign "we both recognized at an early stage the role i could play in helping them build the new york office and introduce them to clients " says mr giuliani who says he only seriously considered joining one other firm that he declines to name he had lunches and dinners with about bracewell partners before the firm agreed to hire him bracewell paid up for the privilege mr giuliani and giuliani partners received &# million for the deal giuliani partners which remains a separate entity was paid in part to compensate for mr giuliani dividing his time between the consulting business and the law firm the former new york mayor also draws an undisclosed salary at the firm bracewell initially asked its partners to personally guarantee about a &# million line of credit that was taken out to cover the giuliani hire and new york office opening partners are no longer on the hook for that loan mr oxford says mr giuliani has been particularly effective at using his connections to attract lawyers to the office among mr giulianis first recruits were michael hess who was appointed by the mayor in to serve as new york citys top lawyer and kenneth caruso who had served under mr giuliani in the justice department in the s last year bracewell lured mark palmer then at linklaters one of the largest firms in the world he says mr giuliani was a "lynchpin" in his decision to join bracewell because it showed the firms commitment to developing a native new york image "there is nothing more local than rudy giuliani in new york city " mr palmer says adding that he was also enticed by the possibility that his partner could become president "from a business development perspective the idea that the firm has managed to get its senior partner in the white house is tremendous " mr palmer says mr oxford says mr giuliani and the new york office have helped deepen relationships with existing clients such as verizon communications inc and reliant energy inc in the summer of mr oxford says he traveled to london with mr giuliani to meet top executives of what is now royal dutch shell plc mr oxford says the firm could not have scored the high level meeting without mr giuliani "leaders around the world admire rudy and want to talk to him " the meeting didnt bring in any new business but mr oxford says he believes that bracewell solidified its stature with the energy company the company confirmed the meeting but declined to elaborate mr giuliani is not required to bill time mr oxford says noting that he has helped on three or four projects in his two years at the firm but mr oxford believes the improved visibility is far more important than billable hours many corporations however still know little about bracewells practice specialties says michael rynowecer the president of bti consulting group inc which conducts market research for law firms "giuliani gave them an awareness factor " says mr rynowecer "but what do people know about them they are still low on that score " on the negative side of the attention coin mr giulianis presidential campaign has brought added scrutiny to bracewell a raft of articles has questioned bracewells ties to certain clients such as citgo petroleum an energy company controlled by hugo chavez the anti american president of venezuela even though mr giuliani did not work on the account "of course there will be issues raised" about bracewell during the campaign says mr giuliani who sold the investment banking arm of his consulting firm to an australian bank earlier this month for an undisclosed sum "there are always issued raised but they have no substance because the firm conducts itself in an honest ethical and decent way " if the former mayor wins the election bracewell will face another issue what to call itself ethical rules governing law firms would require it to drop the coveted giuliani name says mr oxford if so he says the firm may revert to calling itself "just bracewell " and that might be just fine with them "whether there will be buyers remorse likely hinges in part on how well mr giuliani fares in " says edward groves a new york partner with andrews &amp kurth llp a houston based competitor of bracewell "if he wins the management of the firm will look like geniuses " practice makes perfect an overview of mr giulianis career  graduated cum laude from new york university school of law later clerked for a federal judge
