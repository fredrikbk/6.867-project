conrads tax amid the hubbub about u s attorneys last week few people noticed the big beltway economic news senator kent conrad and his fellow democrats proposed their five year budget outline or at least that part of it theyre willing to discuss in public mr conrad the senate budget chairman pulled off the neat magic trick of claiming his budget includes "no tax increase " even as it anticipates repeal of the bush tax cuts after how does he pull that rabbit out of his hat by positing what amounts to a giant asterisk where the tax increase is supposed to go and hoping no one will notice mr conrad has no intention of extending the bush tax cuts which he voted against and whose repeal would slap the economy in with the largest tax increase in u s history but senate democrats dont want anyone to know this at least not before the election so mr conrad says his budget revenue estimates "assume that congress will take steps to counter the effects of the expiration of tax cuts in in a manner that does not add to the nations debt burden " how so well "this additional revenue can be achieved without raising taxes by closing the tax gap shutting down illegal tax shelters addressing tax havens and simplifying the tax code " he avers what the senator should have said is "abracadabra " the year revenue increase from repealing the bush tax cuts is something like &# trillion according to congresss static revenue models mr conrad is claiming that congress will make up for all of that lost revenue by chasing down such illusions as the "tax gap " which the irs claims is the difference between the taxes people owe and what they pay but if this magical &# billion a year as of were easily found dont you think the army of irs auditors and tax collectors would have found it by now the only way to close this "tax gap" is by harassing taxpayers or closing loopholes in ways that are sure to meet political resistance and perhaps result in a backlash congress will never do it all of this is really sleight of hand to disguise that democrats are intent on repealing the bush tax cuts this would raise the tax on capital gains to from more than double the tax rate on dividends to from and sharply increase marginal tax rates at all levels of income and all of this saber rattling about a future tax increase is coming just when the current expansion may need another tax cut to keep growth going investors are worried about subprime credit problems and the federal reserve but this looming tax increase on capital isnt helping confidence the market fell points on the day mr conrad unveiled his magic act last week as mr conrad knows but also wont admit federal revenues have returned to their historic norm as a share of the economy despite the and tax cuts or perhaps we should say because of them tax revenues have climbed by some &# billion since the start of fiscal alone they are now about of gdp last week the irs released new data showing that capital gains realizations surged by from to even with the lower capital gains tax rate meanwhile dividend income rose by a little under from some of this is due to the stock market gains in the wake of the tax cuts but incentive effects also seem to have played a role washington tax analyst dan clifton has crunched the numbers and found that from to dividend income rose only even though the stock market climbed faster than it did from several economic studies have shown that the lower dividend rate inspired companies to pay more dividends the feds get of those increased dividend payouts instead of of nothing meanwhile the budget deficit has steadily been falling in the first five months of fiscal federal spending has slowed to a growth rate while revenues have climbed by and individual tax receipts have jumped by nearly on this trend the congressional budget office says the budget deficit will decline to of gdp this year and will keep falling if economic growth continues by the way the latest irs data also show that the wealthiest americans continue to carry a record share of the income tax load as the nearby chart shows the richest paid of all income taxes in the most recent year in which data are available see accompanying table wsj march the top pay a remarkable two thirds of all income taxes the irony is that the bush tax cuts have made the u s income tax code more progressive but according to john edwards and other class warriors thats not enough if there is a virtue in senator conrads magic budget act it is that it begins to reveal where democrats would take fiscal policy after if they run the entire government voters may want to look behind the conrad curtain before their lower tax rates and higher stock market returns go "poof "
