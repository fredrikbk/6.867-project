new century ceo a crisis survivor faces another one new century financial corp s meltdown has been portrayed as the tale of a company that couldnt keep up with rapidly deteriorating conditions in the convulsing subprime mortgage market but the man at the companys helm is known as a stickler for process and minutiae who sought investors respect in the often maligned subprime industry according to current and former associates brad morrice new centurys embattled year old chief executive is the opposite of so called imperial ceos who remain aloof from day to day business allowing them to claim ignorance of possible mistakes and misdeeds associates describe mr morrice as a down in the trenches executive who has a passion for operations and personal contact with employees the question now is how to square that image with new centurys admission that it hadnt properly accounted for expected losses on defaulted loans and would have to restate earnings triggering events that have moved it to the brink of bankruptcy the company is also under federal investigation into accounting errors and insider stock sales mr morrice the man who will have to answer that question is a survivor of a previous crisis in the savings and loan business he helped guide new century into the subprime world and also sold the companys strategy to wall street bad news mounted yesterday as the irvine calif company disclosed in a securities and exchange commission filing that creditor deutsche bank had asked it to accelerate the repurchase of &# million in loans new century also said that four more states a total of eight so far had issued cease and desist orders for it to operate locally and that the company expected additional states to act new century pledged to cooperate with regulators as it has with the justice department in its criminal investigation mr morrice who took over as chief executive from one of his two fellow new century founders only last july declined to be interviewed for this article since the crisis erupted new century has limited comment to its frequent regulatory filings associates portray mr morrice as one who had long strived to refute the stigma of lending to homebuyers who had poor credit histories he frequently spoke of the need to "mainstream" subprime mortgages so that they became as acceptable to investors as prime home loans more recently he sought to bolster the professional management of a company that had outgrown the family style culture established by new centurys founders mr morrices quest to tighten the ship led him and some board members to pressure founding ceo robert cole to resign last year according to a former senior executive mr morrice felt that mr cole who was also chairman wasnt engaged enough in the business this person said the third founder edward gotschall relinquished his executive role last year as part of a long planned retirement messrs cole and gotschall remain on new centurys board of directors a new century spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment "new century had grown like a weed and brad recognized it wouldnt last " says one person familiar with mr morrices strategy this person says mr morrices plan to improve underwriting information systems and people was overwhelmed by a series of events rising interest rates plateauing housing prices and climbing defaults in mortgage payments combined to erode confidence by new centurys lenders billions of dollars of credit needed to keep the company afloat were withdrawn in a matter of days last month early on mr morrice showed ambition and discipline as he simultaneously earned a law degree and m b a from different schools university of california at berkeley and stanford university respectively in afterward he practiced banking law in los angeles until a client plucked him to help run an orange county mortgage lender and savings and loan says keith holmes his law partner at the time "ive never worked with anyone better in law " mr holmes said at his new employer plaza home mortgage mr morrice met messrs cole and gotschall the company survived the s&amp l crisis and launched one of the early subprime lenders option one that firm is now owned by h&amp r block inc which is trying to sell it when the trio of subprime entrepreneurs founded new century in they divided the labor mr cole was the ceo and face of the company mr gotschall was the numbers man and mr morrice focused on operations driving loan production mr morrice was seen as down to earth and approachable even as the company grew to employees "he wasnt the kind of guy who would fly into seattle show up at and then grab a limo for a four star dinner " says a former senior new century executive who remains in touch with the company "hed take the sales force out to eat and talk to them till midnight " at times mr morrices intensity in analyzing issues meant that he agonized over decisions some associates said such was the case when new century decided to expand from being a loan originator and become a real estate investment trust or reit behind the move was a desire to boost new centurys appeal to wall street investors but the new structure also meant greater risks because the company would be retaining a portfolio of loans rather than reselling them and having to pay out hefty dividends after that decision was made mr morrice began recruiting outside professionals to bolster new centurys management and organization heralding a change to the once cozy corporate culture former executives said last year he brought in a new marketing chief from big commercial bank and mortgage lender washington mutual inc in november a new cfo arrived with pedigree from washington mutual and j p morgan chase &amp co but even though mr morrice tightened lending terms in line with new regulations and appeared to some analysts to be more attuned to quality loans not just quantity bad loans were catching up with new century he kept up
