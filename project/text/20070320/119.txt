the daily fix stanfords home bitter home cardinal suffers again in march online edition on a single night in palo alto calif two underdogs shook up the womens basketball tournament first seed marist knocked off no middle tennessee to advance to the sweet then host stanford a seed lost to no florida state thats two teams with seed numbers higher than advancing to the sweet in one night in one arena or two more than the entire mens tournament which has been the subject of laments including one in yesterdays fix for its lack of surprises stanfords opponents occasionally complain when the cardinal gets to play on its home court in march but maples pavilion hasnt been a sweet home as san francisco chronicle columnist scott ostler points out "this is the fourth time stanford has been knocked out of the ncaa playoffs on its home court " scenes like stanfords teary exit on its home floor are tough for espn coms mechelle voepel to take "march really isnt my favorite part of basketball season " ms voepel writes "because march always includes scenes such as stanfords brooke smith sobbing on teammate candice wiggins shoulder i dont care who the players are or what schools they attend that never gets easier for me to watch i absolutely hate it " des moines register columnist sean keeler saw pain in the eyes of iowa state coach bill fennelly after his cyclones were dominated by georgia "even the smile he flashed for the cameras couldnt hide the hurt " mr keeler writes "you could see it in his eyes there are some seasons some teams you never want to let go this was one of them nine wins out of the cyclones last a magical run to the big tournament championship game that overtime victory over nebraska the crowd for the ncaa opener against washington all of it show me a coach who doesnt hurt in march and ill show you a liar " the hartford courants jeff jacobs says the ncaa is lying for its explanation as to why games played in hartford cost so much more than any other opening round site mr jacobs says the reason is a word the suits would never admit to "avarice " "womens basketball fans see the ruthlessness " mr jacobs writes "thats why their boycott sunday was so impressive forget the announced attendance there were probably empty seats in the civic center for the afternoon session even when uconn played too late at night the crowd of didnt come close to halfway filling the arena look at the attendance at the first and second round sessions at storrs in same plus crowds any talk from ncaa folks with the same old saw that theyll take a look at it falls on the deafest of ears do something then well listen " if kobe bryant had come of age under todays nba rules he would have had to spend at least a year in college before joining the los angeles lakers "the month of the ncaa tournament makes people think about the young stars like bryant who jumped from high school to the nba " kevin modesti writes in the los angeles daily news "it makes us wonder if they miss the kind of intense and permanent emotional connection that exists only between a player and his school they could play a lifetime of pro balls six month schedules and best of whatever playoff series and never have their souls branded by as many all or nothing games as they would have in a single mad march " mr modesti thinks kobe might be better off "his basketball life since lower merion pa high has been the closest the nba can come to replicating ncaa passions its given him the tough love the character shaping the sense of shared destiny " bryant has scored points combined in his last two games and is leading the league in scoring the points race isnt the only one to watch suddenly the eastern conference is looking much more competitive last years conference champs the miami heat have won nine of games led by a rejuvenated healthy shaquille oneal and a sharp jason williams one turnover or fewer in of games since his return from injury miami is looking more and more like a sure thing to have earned a playoff berth by the time injured star dwyane wade returns "healthier and fit and playing defense for the first time the heat has overcome an unholy assortment of awful " dan le batard writes in the miami herald "teams like new jersey and washington have been so ransacked by miami that they might not have any confidence against the heat even if oneal and wade are out together and now that williams looks better than he has at any time in a heat uniform and oneal is fouling out entire front lines again detroit has to be wondering are we really going to try to defend shaq with chris webber in the playoffs " detroit probably wont have to wonder until the conference finals which would be a rematch of last years and the pistons are peaking their last two games against the two best teams in the nominally superior west resulted in a point victory against phoenix and a four point loss at home to dallas "whoever comes out of the west should be the favorite in the finals " michael rosenberg writes in the detroit free press "im just saying the pistons have a chance dont throw them in with the landfill that is the east this team is a contender " andrew flintoff until recently vice captain of englands cricket team has shown a proclivity for excessive celebration "after securing the ashes in the most memorable series of all time flintoff managed to near unanimous approval to make binge drinking cool again with a hour bender that took in an all night stand in the team hotel an open top bus ride through the streets of london and an audience with the prime minister at downing street that may or may not have involved a urination in a flower bed " cricinfos andrew miller writes but his latest bender following englands loss to new zealand in the world cup and preceding the next match against canada by hours wasnt seen as lovably zany he was kept out of the canada match and stripped of his vice captaincy and he has publicly apologized the times of londons christopher martin jenkins says the inconsistent reaction shows a double standard to drinking depending on the outcome of the preceding game "either it is permissible for professional sportsmen to get drunk in public or it is not in my view it is not " the independents james lawton agrees and says englands management is gutless for not taking tougher action against mr flintoff such as forcing him to fly home from the caribbean "he would also unless he wanted to stump up some of the fortune accrued as one of the sporting celebrities of his age have gone in economy class a mode of travel necessarily used by most of those fans who travel the world in the naive belief that they are supporting players committed to winning cricket matches " mr lawton writes hours after pakistan was knocked out of the world cup coach bob woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel room he died soon after from a suspected heart attack mr woolmer was "the world cup had always been cruel to bob woolmer " david hopps writes in the guardian "he will be remembered as one of crickets most pioneering coaches yet the premier one day tournament brought him only regret " the sydney morning heralds peter roebuck paints a dismal picture of the late coachs last public sighting "an overweight shattered figure putting his laptop back into his bag as his shamed team trudged from the field " mr roebuck adds "woolmer was a softly spoken cricketing philosopher with an observant probing mind that penetrated numerous layers of the game without ever quite reaching the core no one who met him could dislike him yet few knew him intimately throughout he was in love with the game of bat and ball endlessly trying to find ways of improving himself and his players he could discuss batting grips as other men can stocks it was an unceasing quest that sometimes took him down blind alleys but to stop the process was to deny the self woolmer lived and died a cricketing man "
