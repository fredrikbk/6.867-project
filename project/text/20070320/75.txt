new horizons for the intrepid vc lots of people are building new it companies you can start a company and sell it to yahoo or google in a couple of years but so can anyone else aerospace is different to paraphrase john f kennedy in we choose to go to the moon not because its easy but because its hard thats why as a long time investor in it and internet start ups im now spending more and more time on private aviation and commercial space start ups im trailing an illustrious crew of it pioneers elon musk space x rockets formerly with paypal vern raburn eclipse aviation very light jets formerly at microsoft symantec and lotus jeff bezos blue origin rockets and still at amazon too jeff greason xcor rockets and formerly with intel and ed iacobucci dayjet air taxi operator and founder of citrix why all the excitement now two big things are happening in aviation the unpleasantness of "regular" air service is driving customers those who can afford it to alternatives on the one hand there are high end services such as warren buffetts netjets which is increasingly profitable and growing healthily though it spends huge amounts on training its people in customer service netjets appeals to people who value their time including their leisure time at thousands of dollars per hour then there are the air taxis which represent the conjunction of aviation and information plus a generation of new very light jets air taxis and private jets are to mass market airlines what pcs are to mainframes they will take you wherever you want to go on demand as long as you want to go to one of the secondary airports they serve but doing so cost effectively requires extensive information and calculations in order to get the most efficient use of airplanes and staff this emerging business model is mostly aimed at people whose employers value their time at &# or more per hour because for example they can make three sales calls a day rather than two in three small non hub cities and still get home at night air taxis often replace hours of driving happier and more productive employees will make air taxis worth paying for consider this i worked on federal express as a junior analyst for a vc firm back in the s fedex was created as a response to the complexity of shipping packages around the country the answer was simple ship them through memphis and make everything routine packages dont know the difference by contrast air taxis represented by start up dayjet take it as given that people unlike packages do care it is needed to optimize the use of aircraft and staffing resources according to specific customer demand with enough hardware and software each trip can be what programmers call an "exception" a route uniquely designed for each customer each time these new air operators will be successful only if they also offer responsive personal service the major airlines have fooled themselves into competing only on price since they cant control the experience the way say netjets can they cant help it if you end up in a middle seat with an unpleasant neighbor and they cant easily charge more for aisle seats because people who board an emptyish plane with many free seats will feel cheated if they paid for an aisle seat to be sure air taxis wont ever make sense for travel between hub cities if only because of airport capacity but the air taxis may well change living and working patterns over time if you dont want to invest in air taxis directly consider the prospects for your local airport on the space side theres a different but equally strong parallel with the world of it the establishment in "space" is the government and especially the military just as it once was along with academia for the internet i remember the days when commerce on the internet was considered sleazy but look at the innovations and productivity it unleashed in the same way the current priests of space are dismayed by the privately funded space start ups unsafe sleazy frivolous imagine ads on the side of a rocket ship well why not if it helps pay for the fuel and the r&amp d that designed the thing tourism is likely to be the initial driver for commercial space travel you can make a deposit on a future suborbital flight feet up with virgin galactic zero g in which i am an investor and two time flier offers flights in a reconfigured that give you a total of eight minutes half minute stretches of weightlessness it charges about &# in our time pressed world thats a compelling proposition where the competition a caribbean cruise for example costs the same amount per person plus a week of time space offers an intensity of experience in a world where high tech is devaluing itself by making artificial experiences so easy the guys building rocket ships are willing to take real risks and theyre selling to passengers who are willing to take risks that may even be part of the appeal the challenge for all these start ups right now they tell me is that investors want to invest in the third round that is they want someone else to take the risks and then come in at the end when the price has been beaten down and the risks overcome but the trick is to start early and stick with it it investors mostly invest in opportunities aerospace investors create them ms dyson is the chairman of edventure holdings and an investor in xcor constellation services
