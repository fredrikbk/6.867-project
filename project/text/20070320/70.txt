minorities and the swimming gap perhaps no institution in america is less racially diverse than the swimming pool the result black children drown at rates far above average the problem has drawn little attention because drownings kill a fraction of the number of african american children who die in say automotive accidents and because black parents havent much protested against the dearth of pools and swim instruction in the inner city in part this is because of higher priorities such as improving schools and reducing crime yet it also reflects the lingering effect of spurious research some of it published in academic journals as recently as the s describing blacks as inherently less buoyant and disadvantaged in water in a los angeles dodgers executive lost his job for making racially insensitive remarks including the assertion that buoyancy deficiencies explain why blacks arent good swimmers still today the ranks of collegiate and olympic swimmers in america support the illusion of white supremacy in the water little wonder that black parents in disproportionate numbers have never learned to swim have harbored a fear of water and have cautioned their children to stay away from it according to many who have studied the problem including an african american swim instructor named lee pitts of fort lauderdale fla "blacks have bought into the myths and misinformation about blacks and swimming " says mr pitts he recalls a childhood friend who prohibited from entering the neighborhood pool by his water fearing mother climbed the fence late one night and drowned now a coalition of local and national health officials and swim groups are creating programs to teach inner city children how to swim focusing particularly on minorities mr pitts for example has created a how to swim video featuring african american instructors and students a black swim star named sabir muhammad is spearheading an effort to promote inner city swim instruction through boys and girls clubs including encouraging nonswimming parents to learn alongside their children "there is a generational lack of swim instruction " says mr muhammad a native of inner city atlanta whose nonswimming mother made it a point to expose him to lessons as a stanford university senior in he became the first african american to set an individual national swimming record "the same parents who make sure their children can read write and play basketball need to make sure their children can swim this is a lifesaving skill " these efforts are expected to get a boost from the release this week of a movie featuring a long ignored hero in american storytelling the black swimmer called "pride " the movie is based on the true story of a philadelphia parks and recreation coach who salvaged an abandoned pool and turned an inner city group of blacks into athletic stars leaving their dingy pool for meets in fancy suburbs the young black swimmers encounter looks of disbelief from their all white competitors but the results make clear that nothing inherent is keeping blacks from achieving success in the pool at the elite level of american swimming a similar message is emerging last year a black american swimmer named cullen jones became the worlds fastest sprinter and signed an endorsement deal with nike inc mr jones has said he intends to use the spotlight to promote swimming among minorities public health officials hope that publicity about african american success in the pool will put misperceptions to rest and help narrow a swimming proficiency gap that helps explain why black children between ages and drown at times the rate for white children swimming ability is such a vital survival skill that some health officials believe it should be a school requirement like reading and writing in the united kingdom it is in america some mostly ivy league colleges require swimming proficiency but their numbers have declined in part because of criticism that the swimming requirement is unfair to minorities to mr muhammad that criticism is misguided requiring swimming proficiency "is not a discriminatory practice " he says "you wouldnt want someone graduating university unable to perform basic math and swimming is a basic necessity " email healthjournal wsj com
