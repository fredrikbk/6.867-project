barclays nears &# billion deal for abn amro purchase would mark largest ever merger of banks in europe in what would be the largest ever banking deal in europe the netherlands abn amro holding nv is nearing a deal to be acquired by barclays plc of the united kingdom for more than &# billion according to people close to the matter the two banks had discussed a deal as long as a year ago but talks foundered the chief executives resumed talks at a meeting in geneva about six weeks ago said people close to the matter even as abn amro publicly asserted that it wanted to remain independent talks could still fall apart as the two sides hammer out further details these people warned such a large and complex deal a cross border merger involving businesses that span the globe and several regulatory authorities could fall apart at many junctures due to small differences if successful the transaction would create a global banking giant with world wide consumer operations including in the u s and businesses ranging from exchange traded funds and fixed income to investment banking and credit cards such a european giant could better compete with global banks in the u s and asia big global banks have had a mixed record often proving less nimble than smaller more focused competitors but a deal likely would prompt big rivals from citigroup inc and bank of america corp in the u s to spains banco santander central hispano sa and the u k s hsbc holdings plc to reassess their own global strategies only a handful of banks are large enough to swallow abn amro a sale would remove from the scene a large target that despite some current problems offers a buyer rare access both to mature markets and the emerging markets that are at the top of every buyers list a deal also would cap several years of rapid consolidation in europes banking system following earlier waves in the u s consolidation began with santanders &# billion acquisition of the u k s abbey national plc in which was followed by the &# billion acquisition by italian bank unicredito italiano spa of germanys hvb that deal stitched together a good part of fast growing eastern europe and set off smaller deals in areas including turkey and ukraine among others a spate of deals in italy has reduced opportunities for mergers there though further consolidation is likely the rash of deals has left fewer opportunities remaining especially for banks within the slower growing areas of europe the barclays abn talks come as banks around the world struggle with increasing bad loans from the souring u s market for mortgages to people with shaky credit many overseas banks have u s businesses such as barclayss larger rival hsbc abn amro sold its u s mortgage business to citigroup in january under the terms being discussed barclays would offer a mix of cash and stock for abn amro valuing the dutch banks shares in the range of low s euros slightly above their current trading price with investors

suggesting investors would be open to the deal but they ended down at pence or &# in p m new york stock exchange trading barclayss adr shares were down or cents a share to &# the combined bank would be run by barclays ceo john varley and headquartered in amsterdam people familiar with the matter said board seats and other senior management positions would be split between the ranks of the two lenders according to a broad agreement negotiated largely between mr varley and abn amro chief rijkman groenink alone the combined bank would have sweeping operations around the world putting abn amros lasalle bank in chicago and operations in countries including a big consumer presence in the netherlands italy and latin america alongside barclayss big u k retail and investment bank and san francisco asset management arm barclayss mr varley sees expansion into the so called bric countries brazil russia india and china as a top priority and something that abn amro offers because of its holdings in brazil but he also would face challenges in integrating the far flung operations a task with which abn amros mr groenink has struggled investors will want to see mr varley find cost savings too something several analysts yesterday said will be difficult the two banks have a big overlap in fixed income investment banking that likely would require large cuts but the banks have little geographical overlap said analyst antony broadbent of research firm sanford c bernstein typically branch banking operations offer big opportunities for cost cuts because of redundant branches and the chance to consolidate back office systems but compared to abn amro barclayss main retail centers are in the u k spain south africa and portugal moreover barclays capital a capital markets business that has been a huge revenue generator for the bank could face a challenge in integrating abn amros capital markets business which includes typical investment bank operations such as trading stocks and advising on mergers that barclays has avoided in the past mr broadbent said final terms could be reached within days said the person close to the matter abn amros mr groenink has been under pressure from activist hedge fund investors for the past month to split up the banks units or join with a rival the childrens investment fund management llp the london activist hedge fund known as tci holds a stake in abn amro and has been pushing for a breakup it has argued that barclays is a credible option but that abn amro has not shown itself willing to conduct a proper search for partners in order to maximize shareholder value a person familiar with the matter said tci will push management to widen its search this person said mr groenink had signaled that he would try to persuade shareholders to support his vision of an independent bank when they meet in late april for abn amros annual meeting but he also said publicly in july that he would be willing to talk if a bidder showed up with an attractive combination and a high price he has built the bank through acquisitions in his seven years at the helm but the bank has underperformed compared to its peers and never emerged as the banking giant that mr groenink aimed to run the chairman of abn amros supervisory board former sears roebuck &amp co ceo arthur c martinez will play a key role in sealing any deal mr martinez joined the board in and became chairman last april abn amro which has a sizeable u s operation figured an executive with u s experience would be beneficial abn amro said in a statement monday that it "is in exclusive preliminary discussions with barclays plc concerning a potential combination of the two organizations " the bank added that "these discussions are the result of careful consideration to create a highly complementary partnership " and cautioned that "the talks are at an early and exploratory stage and there can be no certainty that they will lead to a transaction " for its part barclays confirmed being "in exclusive preliminary discussions" with abn amro alistair macdonald contributed to this article
