&# million for kim the first phase of the north korean denuclearization agreement has passed its halfway mark and its a good time to assess progress if thats the right word kim jong il must be smiling at the very least hes counting his initial return on investment &# million thats what the u s agreed yesterday to transfer from banco delta asia in macau to a north korean account at the bank of china in beijing north korea is on its honor to spend the money for humanitarian and educational purposes of course as state department spokesman sean mccormack noted with a straight face at a briefing yesterday the u s has "limited ability" to confirm that the money is spent correctly for a preview of pyongyangs intentions one need only look at the recent experience of the united nations development fund after evidence of corruption was revealed in these pages in january the undp extracted a pledge from north korea regarding the conditions under which the agency would continue to operate there on march the undp suspended operations because pyongyang had reneged on its promises this &# million for kim comes despite the treasurys announcement last week permanently barring u s banks from doing business with banco delta asia treasury has been investigating bdas links to north korea since it put the bank on a watchlist in september its finding lays out a pattern of money laundering and other illicit activities such as "many north korean related individuals and companies banking at banco delta asia had connections to entities involved in trade in counterfeit u s currency counterfeit cigarettes and narcotics including several front companies suspected of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars in cash through" the bank treasurys initial blacklisting of bda essentially shut down north koreas access to the global financial system thats not likely to change because few banks are willing to risk becoming another bda and losing access to the u s banking system the treasury probe has also had the salutary effect of forcing macau once a favored haunt of north korean "businessmen " to impose better checks on money laundering the investigation which covered some pages of documents was helpful too in exposing north koreas illegal activity world wide one source says that following the "spaghetti like" trail of data has led to useful information about how pyongyang operates and where it puts its money as recently as last week treasury was saying that kim wouldnt get his money back that just one third or one half of the &# million would be returned and then only to non governmental account holders that were not involved in proliferation counterfeiting or other illegal activities but kims negotiators insisted that they wouldnt move ahead on nuclear talks unless the u s handed over the illicit loot so the u s decided to make another pre emptive concession north korea is now expected to make a full accounting of all its nuclear programs and shut down and disable the yongbyon nuclear facility by april we look forward to seeing whats left out of that declaration
