in the fray buffalos defeated art lovers may still spark a revolution on friday a judge in buffalo dismissed a lawsuit filed by buffalo art keepers a grass roots group that argued against the albright knox art gallerys proposed collection sales as "an illegal misappropriation of the gallerys assets which violates its long standing bylaws and cheapens its heritage " this ruling clears the way for the museum to go forward with its sale which begins today all told a total of premodern works many of them important masterpieces of greek roman african ancient near eastern asian and renaissance art will be sold between now and june the money raised will be used to buy contemporary art the sale is a tragedy for the citizens of the buffalo region who will be deprived of significant works of art that are exceptional in their own right but also have long been considered the underpinnings for understanding the museums notable collection of modern and contemporary art art history professor martha dunkelman has ably demonstrated the relationships that link magnificent soon to be sold objects such as a benin bronze head a khmer female torso and a rare early roman figure of artemis and the stag with their various modern counterparts in the collection and ive been told that the atmosphere in buffalo has been poisoned by the myth propagated by the museum in its efforts to justify the sale that this failing rust belt community can raise money only by divesting itself of its cultural capital because theres no new wealth to tap in fact ive also been told that there are massive fortunes in the region many of them made locally some of those millionaires are even trustees of the museum in the old days writing big checks to support acquisitions and other museum programs was considered every board members first responsibility today it seems they prefer to cash in the gifts of earlier generations in light of the albright knoxs strip mining of its collection and the epidemic of deaccessioning in institutions like it across america its interesting to remember that in the early s the financial accounting standards board fasb caused an uproar in the museum community after issuing a draft proposal suggesting that collections should be recognized as assets and therefore be capitalized in financial statements museum directors bridled at the suggestion later dropped that their collections could be viewed as having anything other than historical and artistic value said one museum official at the time "collections are not an asset in the way businesses consider assets the collection is not something used as an investment something that can be sold off to make money " how times have changed we ought now to guffaw loudly about the ensuing outrage at fasbs proposal since museums are now so eager to capitalize their collections perhaps fasb or some government entity should revisit this issue if only in the interests of protecting the publics patrimony but there may be a silver lining to this particular cloud the failed lawsuit was just one manifestation of the strong local reaction to the albright knoxs sale an unprecedented outpouring of disapproval that took the museum completely by surprise it also resulted in the formation of buffalo art keepers which worked ultimately in vain to demonstrate the publics deep affection for works of art in their local museum in reluctant response to pressure from that organization led by the poet carl dennis a pulitzer prize winner museum officials called a meeting of the albright knoxs membership on march to discuss the deaccession plan more than people showed up since journalists were excluded from the meeting i attended as a member a role i began in elementary school the carefully orchestrated proceedings included five speakers on each side of the issue and ballot whether the trustees ought voluntarily to delay the proposed sales for a sufficient period of time to permit a full and fair evaluation of the basis purpose and terms of the sales and the effect of such sales on the museum and its community the prepared arguments on both sides were thoughtful and articulately presented as were most of the briefer extemporaneous remarks that followed those speaking against the sale were especially passionate in their repeated citation of specific works to which they felt personal attachment thats precisely the kind of emotional energy museum directors long to inspire in their public yet disdain for these concerns was especially evident in the remarks of the museums director louis grachos and the trustees who spoke using the kind of spin and contempt for factual accuracy that we associate with the political class the museums spokespersons misrepresented the collections history as one devoted to mostly modern and contemporary art in fact a significant number of the masterpieces about to be subjected to what one speaker called "a yard sale" and another characterized as "betting the house" were quite intentionally purchased by previous distinguished directors patrick klinck a young fifth generation buffalonian pleaded against "running roughshod over the safeguards enacted for the express purpose of preserving the collection intact across the ages " suggesting that this dishonors the memory of previous generations "and reflects badly on us " the response of museum officials and trustees was clear they know best they dont need the advice of the unwashed public anyway its just not done that way "we are professionals so we know what we are doing " that flies in the face of the new mania for museum visitor surveys and other instruments for measuring public reaction and interest which may now cynically be best understood as gimmicks to persuade government and foundation funders that there is concern for the public a majority of museum members attending the meeting cast their nonbinding votes against the sale but the museum mounted a vigorous telephone campaign for proxy votes supporting the sale enough to turn the outcome officials of the albright knox may have won the battle but the community outrage triggered by their brazen disregard for the museums riches ought to serve as a warning to museum directors and trustees across the country they cant have it both ways expecting public support while arrogantly asserting that the public be damned this storm in buffalo might be just the beginning of a revolution in which the public begins to reclaim its rights to public institutions and demands an accountability that museum directors and trustees will ignore at their peril mr freudenheim a former art museum director served as the assistant secretary for museums at the smithsonian institution see related letter "letters to the
