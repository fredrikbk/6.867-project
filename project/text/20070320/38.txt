washington blacklisted the bank on suspicion the funds were connected to money laundering or counterfeiting last week the u s treasury department was expected to offer guidance that would allow macau banking regulators to identify holders of accounts at the bank that had been tied to the allegedly criminal activities but pyongyang made no secret of its insistence that the funds must be released before it would move ahead with shutting down its main yongbyon nuclear reactor the funds now are to be transferred into a north korean account at the bank of china in beijing to be "used solely for the betterment of the north korean people " according to u s deputy assistant treasury secretary daniel glaser though a u s state department spokesman acknowledged monday the difficulties in monitoring how north korea will use the money the quid pro quo is that pyongyong moves ahead with the shutdown which is a big plus both for the region and the world assuming kim jong il keeps his word

breakneck economic growth has lifted millions of people out of poverty the millions left behind pose a challenge for the ruling communist party which has staked its legitimacy on its ability to make people richer and is worried about the potential for social unrest one big factor in the wealth gap is that investment in chinese export oriented industries has been concentrated overwhelmingly along the coasts and major rivers near chinas ports because investors who want to produce goods for export have balked at building factories in provinces where reliable transportation links to seaports are scarce now as bruce stanley reports beijing plans to upgrade chinas vast but overburdened rail system to link more parts of the country to one another and ultimately to overseas markets the plan calls for the government to nearly quadruple its investment in the nations railroads to almost &# billion by the aim is to create kilometers of new track much of it in underserved central and western china by the end of the decade if china meets its goal the rail system will have grown to more than kilometers the investment would provide a missing link in chinas logistical infrastructure the nations seaports are among the worlds most modern and efficient but its railroads which could be supplying these ports with a lot of the goods they send abroad arent up to the task in many other countries

writes that syrias allies led by lebanons emile lahoud and hezbollah have prevented lebanons parliament from voting on the protocol and campaigned to destroy the government of prime minister fuad siniora after five unanimous security council resolutions on the u n murder inquiry and the proposed special tribunal the credibility of international justice is at stake in the hariri case he writes yet the investigation unfortunately also coincides with an irrepressible itch for western politicians to "engage" baathist syria most reprehensible was the trip to damascus on march of european union
