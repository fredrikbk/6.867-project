the afternoon report directors cut online edition blockbuster is trying to remake itself into an online movie rental powerhouse and this morning its chief executive ended up on the cutting room floor ending an unusual public dispute between a company and one of its top executives over compensation blockbuster chairman and chief executive john antioco agreed to leave the struggling video rental company by the end of the year after at last reaching an agreement with the board of directors on his bonus for mr antioco maintained that he had met performance goals laid out in his employment contract and that he was entitled to a bonus of nearly &# million but the board on which billionaire investor carl icahn and a number of his allies sit disagreed blockbuster has been scrambling to avoid becoming a movie biz flop of "waterworld" proportions ever since the internet video rental upstart netflix popped onto the scene it has tried various schemes in a bid to catch up including ditching late fees for videos rented from its stores and launching a competing netflix style service of its very own some analysts say that those efforts have begun to yield fruit but the patience of the icahn led board appeared to be waning mr antioco who has been in his current job since and thus at the helm through all of blockbusters recent strife will receive a &# million bonus more than the &# million the board awarded him in january but shy of the &# million maximum that he had sought additionally he will get a &# million going away sum when his employment at the company ends under the terms of his contract mr antioco stood to reap a &# million payment if he had been "terminated without cause or resigned for good reason " for as much as mr icahn may be happy to see mr antioco stroll off however some on wall street think the move will only increase the turmoil that is surrounding blockbuster jeffrey b logsdon analyst at bmo nesbitt burns downgraded the company to "market perform" from "outperform" after the news of mr antiocos exit was made public writing in a note to clients that the news "will create a transition period that makes it difficult for us to see much more upside

by mail service but that still trails netflixs six million or so paying customers by a wide berth the company is meanwhile spending a fortune to lure all those customers to its ranks though its uncertain whether blockbuster is winning a mass of converts from netflix or simply getting its store customers to go online instead the cost of attracting new business may only go higher as competition heats up netflix unveiled a service earlier this year that allows users to download a movie rental to their computer and other formidable competitors such as apples itunes and wal mart are also stepping up their downloads business mr antioco believed that blockbuster could thrive by offering its customers a so called triple play of in store rentals dvds by mail and downloads but its now
