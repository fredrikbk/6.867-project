the middle seat what airlines do when you complain mike wallace of san francisco was so mad about recent travel experiences and a lack of response to his complaints that he searched the internet for email addresses at ual corp s united airlines and fired off an angry letter to more than company officials no response a second email to all the addresses he could find that used united com and ual com did get some attention in all after corresponding with united a dozen different times about being stranded at airport hotels on two different trips because of united flight problems mr wallace and his wife got some measure of satisfaction business class upgrades for some future trips and a &# voucher "its a series of systems policies and nameless faceless people in place to wear you out most people just give up but i pursued and pursued and pursued before i finally got something " said mr wallace an environmental consultant and elite level united customer a united spokeswoman says the airlines goal is to "satisfy our customers the first time they call write or email us " after the aggravation of mechanical breakdowns computer meltdowns schedule changes lost luggage missed connections and long telephone or airport waits many customers fire off angry complaints to airlines only to get less than satisfying responses but there are ways to get more redress airlines and travel experts say this week the middle seat focuses on how airlines handle complaints next week the column will look at the department of transportations role in addressing fliers grievances a common mistake telling an airline youll never fly them again if so then the airline no longer has an incentive to try to win back the customer some airline officials say another tip always tell the airline what you want in compensation and be realistic a one hour delay wont get you anything but if the airline canceled your flight because of a mechanical problem forced you to spend the night in a cheap motel and miss your important morning meeting then lost your bag the next day you can ask for something meaningful like a free ticket "sorry doesnt cost the airline anything and theres no reason for them to give you anything if you dont ask " says joe brancatelli publisher of business travel site joesentme com federal rules require airlines to reimburse customers for lost luggage and compensate them for bumping them from overbooked flights after that as with most any business consumers are on their own seeking redress for bad service there are differences in how airlines handle customer complaints united and continental airlines for example still have phone lines to field complaints more than continental employees are trained to resolve problems and compensate passengers on the spot a spokeswoman says most other carriers dont take complaints by telephone mail fax or email only once airlines respond to a written complaint you typically cant talk to the customer service agent to appeal either in general most airlines pay more attention to complaints from top tier frequent fliers especially customers who spend lots of money each year with the airline airlines track customers not by miles flown but by dollars spent and high dollar customers get more generous compensation when they complain but airlines say all complaints do get heard many get investigated and all get a response of some sort even if its only a formulaic apology most carriers say they track complaints and compile monthly summary reports for executives and many say they forward the complaint to the employee involved and supervisors the most efficient way for them to field complaints is by email letters get scanned electronically into computer systems and airlines generally respond quicker to emails than to mailed letters automation is changing the airline complaint business many carriers now have systems that flag flights with lengthy airline caused delays or nightmarish conditions then generate letters of apology to passengers some with offers of additional frequent flier miles or vouchers offering discounts on future trips theres a lot more airlines could do in the future too new systems are under development that will track passenger experience in airline computers if airlines spend the money to install the systems reservation computers could flag previous bad experiences when you check in the agent could apologize for the six hour delay on your last trip or your lost baggage and offer a free upgrade or coupon for a snack or drink carriers say customers dont need to send complaints to the offices or emails of high ranking executives complaints routinely get forwarded to the complaint department no matter how they come in some travel experts question that suggesting that a slew of complaints to a ceo might catch the eye of an assistant doing the forwarding and the trend might get mentioned but theres little follow up at airlines executives rarely follow complaints and inquire if they were ever resolved american airlines has customer service specialists to field complaints but only those via letter email or fax they dont take phone calls less than of customers who complain send a second complaint saying they arent happy with the response something the company tracks closely says kurt stache president of americans frequent flier program who also handles customer service one who did send a second angry letter over a nightmare trip was patrick swann whose wife chelly bouferrache had a laptop computer stolen from a bag that american lost during their honeymoon trip to europe the alexandria va couple endured late flights missed connections and a night in an airport hotel american paid more than &# for the computer even though its rules say the airline isnt responsible for electronic gear and responded to the couples initial complaint by offering them extra frequent flier miles each mr swann particularly angry that american wouldnt take complaints by phone fired off a second complaint asking for more american said no "we wont fly american airlines again except to use up frequent flier miles " ms bouferrache said american says it ended complaint phone banks to save money and because the phone lines often had long waits further angering customers ed perkins a travel expert at smartertravel com says if a second letter doesnt get the desired response the only recourse travelers usually have is small claims court an airline ticket is a contract for service and if the airline failed to live up to the terms spelled out in its "contract of carriage" available on airline web sites you can pursue a claim in court "you have to demonstrate some real loss not just be mad that the flight attendant was snotty to you " mr perkins said indeed some consumer experts say traveler expectations are often out of synch with the reality of todays low fare travel with airlines still struggling for survival "no one should expect a complaint to be adequately responded to " says stephen brobeck executive director of the consumer federation of america consumers are wise to protect themselves from potential problems avoid checking bags and connecting flights if possible or at least closely timed connections ripe for problems with delays dont book the last flight before a big meeting or a cruise ship departure fly at off peak times give yourself plenty of time for security and check complaint statistics and flight reliability online today email scott with your questions about air travel and the airline industry at

meaningful responses to complaints ask for what you want dont just say what are you going to do to make me happy make the compensation fit the problem dont ask for an expensive upgrade because of a routine delay just the facts maam complaint letters should be short direct and have specific flight reservation and frequent flier numbers dont make threats saying you ll never fly the airline again
