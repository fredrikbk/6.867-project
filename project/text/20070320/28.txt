cotton may fight back excess supply has kept prices soft but commodity could be a solid bet as textiles market spurs demand pity king cotton unlike corn sugar and some other crops the famed fiber has been largely overlooked as investors drive up the prices of agricultural commodities across the globe cotton isnt widely used to make such alternative energy as ethanol so there has been no recent surge in fuel related demand as there has been with other farm products there also are millions of bales of excess supply left over from bumper harvests in recent years keeping a lid on prices some say that makes king cotton just the kind of smart bargain investment that is becoming increasingly rare as the worlds commodities boom powers through its fifth year that boom has pushed up the prices of a wide range of commodities and raw materials as some of these products slip from their recent highs many investors believe there wont be significant new increases anytime soon prompting hedge funds and others to scour for new bets cotton has a lot in its favor they say chinas growth and a booming textile trade are fueling demand with world wide consumption rising about a year more than three times the annual average rate of to more important of late the soaring need for biofuels is pulling acreage away from crops that arent as widely used to make them including cotton in the future farmers will have to devote even more land to corn sugar and other energy yielding crops to meet new goals for biofuel production in the u s and europe this month the u s department of agriculture predicted u s farmers would cut cotton acreage this year to the lowest level in years the national cotton council of america recently added that cotton acreage could fall nearly in from last year to about million acres such a shift by the worlds biggest cotton exporting nation by far is significant especially if the trend continues says ricardo leiman chief operating officer of noble group ltd a hong kong commodity supply chain manager "what you have to figure out is who will supply all that cotton in the long term " one answer of course is other countries especially developing nations such as india india has significantly boosted yields in recent years in part by introducing better seed varieties still india and other producers may not have enough land and water to sustain a prolonged boom cotton is among the most water intensive crops in the world china by far the worlds biggest consumer faces a similar predicament "the chinese have the same problem with cotton as with all crops theyre already using every acre that theyre not devoting to a construction project " says dan basse president of agresource co a chicago research firm china is expanding production in its less developed western provinces but water supplies there already are under tremendous strain leading to widespread desertification partly as a result mr basse says he could see cotton prices shoot up as much as in the next two years the price of the front month cotton futures contract closed at cents per pound yesterday on the new york board of trade skeptics note that it could be years before the world works through the large stockpiles held in the u s and elsewhere government support programs in the u s also complicate the picture by potentially encouraging some farmers to keep growing cotton even if prices arent high by historical standards developing nations could wind up boosting yields more than some people expect and run the danger of overproducing still cotton has plenty of high profile fans among them longtime commodity bull jim rogers who says cotton prices could more than double in the next several years in part because some of the alternatives synthetic fibers made from petroleum products are becoming more expensive too "i see an internet like boom right now" that is driving investors to look at just about any agricultural commodity they think can have a price run says jim lambert an analyst at globecot inc a cotton research firm in nashville tenn even so he is a believer in the long term cotton story he says if current trends hold he says "cotton is going to be affected " cotton has long played a large role in the world economy grown in hot and sometimes humid climates the crop is shipped in bales to textile mills and ultimately used to make a large portion of the worlds clothing the cotton market already was showing signs of a shake up even before the alternative energy boom took off the u s has been under intense pressure from competing cotton producers to dismantle some of its subsidies and china has been looking for more low cost options in countries closer to home including india and africa chinese imports from india nearly quintupled last year from and now account for about of chinas imported supply up from almost none in yet these shifts may only exacerbate the pressures that could emerge down the road at the same time domestic consumption is rising in developing nations especially india adding further uncertainty to their ability to supply world demand if acreage in extant cotton powers declines
