president pervez musharraf confronts a political climate still seething with opposition to his rule with national elections scheduled for early january mr musharraf and his allies face an array of new challenges some stem from his decision to suspend the constitution and impose emergency rule on nov which helped galvanize political opposition increased voter skepticism and made foreign allies wary of the presidents motives some political opponents contend that decision could weaken the former army generals authority by casting doubts on his claims of promoting democracy and personal freedom "no army dictator can be moderate and he cant be progressive " said afrasiab khattak president of the awami national party a political party in pakistans northwest frontier province mr musharraf has made sure that dislodging him wont be easy just before he announced the lifting of the emergency late saturday his legal team unveiled a series of orders that aim to lock in changes made during the emergency rule one order says the president is exempt from a law that bars civil servants and military personnel from running for office within two years of retiring opponents said that law should have disqualified mr musharraf from contesting elections another presidential order says mr musharrafs dismissal of supreme court judges and more than high court judges cant be challenged in court after mr musharraf announced the emergency his government also jailed thousands of political opponents and reeled in pakistans private media a new supreme court stacked with judges loyal to him

defend his actions he alleged that a conspiracy of unnamed opponents had tried to overthrow his government and said the countrys stability was at stake "against my will as a last resort i had to impose the emergency in order to save pakistan " he told the television audience despite the lifting of the emergency restrictions on electronic media remain pakistans spunky private broadcasters are

changes " mr musharrafs government wants political stability ahead of jan elections the balloting will elect a new parliament which will in turn select a new prime minister mr musharraf who is not a member of any party would like parliament to include as many of his supporters from the pakistan muslim league as possible and ideally a friendly prime minister with the election mr musharraf is also trying to show the world that he can lead pakistans peaceful return to democratic rule more than eight years after he came to power in a military coup his supporters argue that pakistan has benefited economically under mr musharrafs rule over the past five years the economy has averaged annual growth ushering in a new class of urban consumers though inflation also pushed up food prices new roads schools and clean drinking water have appeared in pakistans poor rural areas and before the supreme court began scrutinizing sales of state owned companies corporate privatization had proceeded at a brisk pace "hes made a difference " said muhammad intikhab khan a top official in the pakistan muslim league q party that serves as mr musharrafs main political ballast "we are enjoying a strong economy the people finally have a government interested in development " yet pakistan has also faced a period of political turmoil since march when mr musharraf attempted to dismiss the supreme courts chief justice street protests most of them small scale have become a regular occurrence in islamabad and lahore in recent weeks the military has had to beat back an islamist insurgency that captured a swath of the northwest frontier province some opponents have accused mr musharraf of allowing extremist forces to thrive while seeking to quash a movement of lawyers journalists and students that advocated broader civil liberties mr musharrafs political opponents hope to use public anger over the emergency to propel them to power in parliament if opposition parties led by former prime ministers benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif win enough seats they are expected to challenge the changes put in place during the emergency they could also try to reinstate the judges mr musharraf dismissed "if they get enough seats " said mr rizvi the political analyst "theyll make musharrafs life very difficult " zahid hussain contributed to this article
