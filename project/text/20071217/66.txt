russia by the numbers during the cold war the u s government estimated the soviet military budget by asking how much it would cost for the u s to produce the same fighting force after meeting with leaders of the european union recently vladimir putin boasted that the surging russian economy has overtaken that of italy and will overtake france in such astonishing claims have become commonplace in statements by russian officials who insist russia will become the worlds fifth largest economy by mr putins popularity at home and his standing abroad rest in large part on economic performance so its worth looking closely at these forecasts they are based on a system of measurement called purchasing power parity ppp under which economists try to assign every good from rice to subway fares the same price world wide the conventional method by contrast takes the price of goods produced locally and translate them into dollars at the current exchange rate ppp inflates the size of poor economies in which food and the other basics of life are cheap in the russian case black bread vodka and run down apartments pump up gdp the effect can be dramatic measured in conventional terms russia far from overtaking france in two years is actually less than half its size &# trillion vs &# trillion at current growth rates their gdps will not be equal for years all those people who sneered about the puny russian economy of the s no bigger than the netherlands they said need to update their numbers but not by much after eight years of strong growth the russian economy in conventional terms is now as big as the netherlands plus belgium and luxembourg of course which system of measurement is "right" depends on what you want to know if youre interested in a countrys place in the global economy then exchange rate measures are for you if you want a feel for living standards then purchasing power parity can carefully used be a helpful tool and not just to measure food consumption during the cold war the u s government estimated the soviet military budget by asking how much it would cost for the u s to produce the same fighting force once you assigned red army conscripts the same wages as american volunteers soviet defense spending looked a lot scarier you might say this is what mr putin is trying to do for his entire economy there are however two problems with the way russian officials treat these gdp estimates first they use the ppp numbers to measure something their global economic standing that the conventional numbers measure better you have only to play with international trade figures for a while to see how underdeveloped russias role in the world economy remains how much for example would you expect the united states to trade with a country that might soon overtake france the u s exported five times more to france in &# billion than to russia &# billion this year the u s still exports more to the dominican republic than to russia and u s two way trade with malaysia is twice our two way trade with russia perhaps you say russian american trade is atypical and looking at russias trade with its closest neighbor europe would paint a different picture yes but not as different as you might think as peter mandelson the eus trade commissioner put it recently russias exports to the eu are apart from energy "about the same as those of morocco or argentina" slightly less than of europes total imports the eus energy imports from russia are of course about twice that level or of all imports a big number but it too should be kept in perspective between and russias share in european natural gas imports dropped from to european politicians say they want to diversify their sources of supply theyre talking about something that may already be happening and can be pushed further there is a second problem with russian leaders economic claims if we use ppp figures as intended to compare living standards we will be at least as impressed by how far russia has to go as by how far it has already come just consider per capita gdp growth in russia france and italy under mr putin russian per capita income even in ppp terms has gone from somewhat less than a third of the level of france and italy to somewhat more than a third this increase is good news for russian consumers but they remain europes poor relations all the same interestingly mr putin himself used to make this point when he first became president to underscore how poor his country was and how urgent it was to reform he observed that it would take years of economic growth for russias per capita income to equal portugals this was a particularly brutal comparison because russians saw portugal not as a rich european state but as a poor one and how humiliating to be compared to such a small country these days mr putin does not use the portugal comparison so much the urgency of reform is less on his mind so heres the update with all its growth russia is gaining ground but the absolute gap between the two countries is only modestly narrower than when mr putin first compared them just over &# then just under &# now meanwhile the gap between russia and both france and italy has widened slightly even if russia keeps steaming ahead it will probably not catch up with portugal until and by some estimates long after that these comparisons do not detract from the russian economys extraordinary growth its transformation is a huge opportunity for anyone who is a part of it the reason however is not that russia has catapulted itself into the ranks of the rich but that it is still relatively poor the low base from which it is growing means that strong increases can continue for a long time before petering out just ask european machinery exporters their sales to russian companies quadrupled between and similarly the low living standards of the russian people mean that the leveling off of their consumption surge is decades away its good politics and maybe even good geopolitics for mr putin and his colleagues to claim theyve come further than they have but well understand todays russia better if we dont believe them mr sestanovich is a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and a professor of international diplomacy at columbia university
