politics &amp economics backlash entangles chavez efforts to sway south america meet wider resistance the populist leader has recently faced a string of setbacks to his ambitions including civil unrest in bolivia a scandal over venezuelas alleged attempt to meddle in argentine elections and a slap on the wrist from his own citizens venezuelan president hugo chavez has used his charisma and his pocketbook in a bid to export his "revolution" across south america but the populist leader has recently faced a string of setbacks to his ambitions including civil unrest in bolivia a scandal over venezuelas alleged attempt to meddle in argentine elections and a slap on the wrist from his own citizens mr chavez a year old former army officer has lavished money around the region in the hopes of becoming the de facto leader of a united south america that stands up to the u s and charts its own course to prosperity since he became president in mr chavez has succeeded in creating a small regional bloc of like minded countries that includes venezuela ecuador bolivia and cuba his rhetoric about ending the regions long standing inequality has won support from nongovernmental groups such as trade unions in many countries but for all his spending his influence over regional affairs appears stuck many of his projects such as a regional oil pipeline are gathering dust on the drawing board others such as a plan to create a regional lending institution called bank of the south are unlikely to live up to his grandiose vision venezuelas relations with neighboring colombia meanwhile are deteriorating fast bolivia by far mr chavezs most successful foreign project has started to unravel a chavez inspired constitutional rewrite has split the country and prompted several key states to threaten to secede yesterday tens of thousands of bolivians in eastern energy rich provinces celebrated a declaration of autonomy from the central government a rival rally was held in the capital la paz heightening tensions in the andean nation in an expression of how serious anti venezuelan sentiment has become in some parts of bolivia a mob of protestors last week pelted a venezuelan military plane with stones after it landed forcing it to make an emergency take off the main roadblock to mr chavezs regional ambition is that allies such as bolivia and ecuador cant follow his recipe of lavish spending fuelled by oil wealth because they dont have the money "the venezuela experiment cant be replicated in any other place even venezuela doesnt have the money to do that in the long run " says gil merkx the director of duke universitys center for international studies mr chavezs setbacks abroad come on the heels of his first major electoral defeat at home when voters turned down his attempt to rewrite the constitution to allow himself unlimited re election the dec vote may force mr chavez to spend more time focusing on problems at home polls show that venezuelans are upset over his handling of the economy and dont want him spending money abroad "his own people are really annoyed at the amount of money hes sending to other countries " says david myers a professor of political science at penn state university and expert on venezuela but says prof myers it is doubtful that mr chavez can rein in his impulse to expand his influence abroad the scandal over funding argentinas election can only reinforce the feeling among venezuelans about their spendthrift leader last week u s prosecutors said they believe a briefcase containing &# in cash that was seized in argentina in august was intended to be a secret contribution from venezuela to the election campaign of argentine president cristina kirchner who was inaugurated last week mrs kirchner who is succeeding her husband nestor as president and mr chavez have angrily denied the claims but the accusation could support long held beliefs in the region that mr chavez has been actively and illegally financing election campaigns in other countries in an attempt to win allies to be sure the arrests could drive argentina and venezuela closer together as their governments close ranks against the u s allegations the venezuelan leader could also receive a boost in april when paraguay elects a new leader an opposition candidate retired bishop fernando lugo is seen as having a reasonable shot at ending six decades of control by the ruling colorado party mr lugo is seen as a natural ally for mr chavez as long as oil prices continue to flirt with records mr chavez will have an enormous war chest and governments in the region "will accept his checks as long as hes writing them and theyll say what he wants to hear for a time " says prof myers of penn state "but behind his back they all think his projects are a bit silly " but many of mr chavezs regional ambitions are already losing traction brazil the regional heavyweight has treaded softly with mr chavez but also works to keep him in check brazil has insisted that venezuela drop trade barriers faster if it is to join the mercosur trading bloc a stand that may slow venezuelas admission and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silvas trip to bolivia this week is seen as an attempt to dilute venezuelas influence there many of mr chavezs international initiatives seem doomed from the start this week he called on latin nations to repatriate their international reserves held in the u s even though venezuela maintains a large amount of its own funds in the u s similarly mr chavez vowed to quit the imf many months ago but halted the plan after learning that the move would put venezuelas foreign debt in default mr chavez had an apparent success this week when seven nations came together to form the so called bank of the south but the regional lender faces big hurdles before it can give out a single dollar so far no country has agreed on how much each nation would put up of the estimated &# billion in start up capital nor any of the rules about lending in the end mr chavezs greater dreams of glory may end much like those of his hero simon bolivar who once dreamed of uniting south america but who admitted on his deathbed he had "ploughed the sea " here there and everywhere some of venezuelan president hugo chavezs international pledges ecuador a share in a &# billion refinery argentina &# billion in state
