bali aims to share weight of emissions cuts white house press secretary dana perino said the decision has features "that are quite positive including provisions recognizing the importance of developing clean technologies financing the deployment of those technologies in the developing world assisting countries in adapting to climate change exploring industry sector agreements on emissions and addressing deforestation " bali indonesia the climate change pact adopted here saturday paves the way for developing nations to take more responsibility in combating the global threat a departure from the kyoto protocol the agreement approved by nearly nations after several days of talks calls on developing nations to take "actions" to mitigate climate change in a "measurable reportable and verifiable" manner the language implies that countries like china which is poised to overtake the u s as the worlds largest carbon emitter will face a new level of accountability and pressure to reduce emissions under the next global climate change pact but the accord hammered out at the end of the day united nations conference stopped short of requiring the developing or the developed world to make binding cuts "we are not saying we will accept caps " said munir akram chairman of the group of which represents about developing countries including china and india at the conference "we are saying we are trying our best to develop a climate friendly path to development we will try to do it differently than the west many of us are doing it anyway for our own good " the agreement lays out an initial "road map" that aims to set a timetable and other parameters to guide negotiations on a new global climate treaty over the next two years the new treaty will succeed the kyoto protocol which expires in paula dobriansky deputy u s secretary of state and a leader of the american delegation called the accord "a new chapter in climate diplomacy" and said the u s is "very committed to developing a long term global greenhouse gas reduction emission goal " but for president bushs administration the initial agreement made in bali didnt go far enough in calling for contributions from the developing world the white house has argued that binding emissions caps could hurt the u s economy unless they also apply to major emitters like china and india white house press secretary dana perino said the decision has features "that are quite positive including provisions recognizing the importance of developing clean technologies financing the deployment of those technologies in the developing world assisting countries in adapting to climate change exploring industry sector agreements on emissions and addressing deforestation " but she said the u s has "serious concerns " notably over the ways in which it could let big developing economies avoid their fair share of clean up responsibilities she said negotiations must differentiate between smaller poorer countries and big emerging economic powers that can afford pollution reduction measures she noted that studies on emission trends conclusively establish that "emissions reductions principally by the developed world will be insufficient to confront the global problem effectively " under kyoto poor nations arent required to cut emissions on the theory industrialized nations which are responsible for the buildup of greenhouse gas emissions over decades should take the lead but the lack of participation from the developing world has limited the treatys effectiveness and is one reason global emissions of greenhouse gases which scientists say trap heat in the earths atmosphere have risen rapidly since it was implemented the u s which is neck and neck with china as the worlds largest emitter didnt sign the kyoto protocol partly because it placed no onus on the developing world the term "actions" in the bali pact leaves flexibility on what kind of changes developing nations will be asked to make but some observers said it could include commitments to reduce emissions from sectors such as steel or power generation the u s initially objected to parts of the pact that called on industrialized nations to provide financing and other assistance to help the developing world acquire technology to reduce its dependence on heavily polluting energy sources such as coal at the end of the bali negotiations that language was the subject of a showdown between the u s and delegates from developing nations that threatened to derail the agreement in what many called an unusual breach of diplomacy for a u n proceeding delegates booed u s responses during a final negotiating session kevin conrad ambassador of papua new guinea to the u n drew seconds of applause when he told the u s delegation the rest of the world would move on without it "if youre not going to lead please get out the way " he said the u s delegation then shifted gears and conceded to demands by developing nations for more funding for clean technology and similar steps the americans succeeded in wiping out most language regarding specific targets for emission reductions from industrialized nations despite strong objections from the european union yayu yuniar contributed to this article
