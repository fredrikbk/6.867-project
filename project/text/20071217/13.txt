companies need ceos to stop spinning and start thinking richard kovacevich chairman of wells fargo and his lieutenants deliberately steered clear of the riskiest sorts of subprime mortgages "stated income" or "low documentation" loans to borrowers with sketchy credit forget the charisma and the polished speeches those may have been the qualities top executives were judged on this past year when every other chief executive was publishing a book appearing on prime time television or socializing on facebook com but today with everyone predicting a more volatile year ahead business executives are going to be graded more heavily on whether the decisions they make on everything from strategy to talent help their companies grow they have to stop becoming experts on giving a positive spin to economic warnings and start analyzing the data at hand this is particularly the case in banking and on wall street as the subprime mortgage troubles continue to unravel its also true in the media and entertainment industries where the rapid growth of the internet is upending traditional media and in pharmaceuticals where the expiration of patents threatens old giants "successful executives have to be able to discern the really important decisions and get a high percentage of them right " says warren bennis a professor at the university of southern california and co author with noel tichy of "judgment how winning leaders make great calls " "this is the heart of great leadership especially now when so much is changing so quickly " in a bumpy business landscape where there are so many demands on executives time leaders must determine whats critical to their companies so they can mobilize their people to take action and they cant assume that just because a rival is succeeding with a certain strategy they will too thats the mistake many finance executives made in recent months "what led to the subprime meltdown was a manic denial of good judgment because there were warning signs everywhere " says mr bennis not everyone fell into this trap richard kovacevich chairman of wells fargo and his lieutenants deliberately steered clear of the riskiest sorts of subprime mortgages "stated income" or "low documentation" loans to borrowers with sketchy credit they stayed out even though it caused them to lose market share in the short term that would have generated big loan fees "we talked about what other banks investment firms and mortgage brokers were doing " but decided "its economically unsound" and "doesnt make sense " he says by making such risky loans to financially stretched borrowers "youre basically saying defraud me &amp nbsp " adds mr kovacevich whose bank has avoided the huge losses incurred at rivals giving that kind of loan "isnt in our dna " they didnt avoid every misstep in its home equity loan business wells fargo strayed from sound lending practices mr kovacevich acknowledges the bank the nations fourth largest by stock market value bought some home equity loans from brokers instead of sticking only with loans to its own customers these broker originated loans are souring at an accelerated rate and wells fargo has announced that it will take a special loan loss provision in the fourth quarter to cover losses "we made a mistake jumping into this market instead of testing it first for six months " says mr kovacevich by addressing the problem quickly however wells has minimized damage good decision making usually reflects an executives overall business philosophy and management style mr kovacevich for example has long preached the importance of managing risk and cross selling products to customers the banks average retail customer buys more than five products twice the industry average "its our fault if a customer is unprofitable because it means we havent done a good enough job of convincing them to give us all their financial business instead of just a piece " he tells employees in addition he has resisted following other banks that have cut costs through massive layoffs "when you do that you just end up with low employee morale and customer dissatisfaction " he adds other executives depend on frank discussions with subordinates to help them make good decisions at hewlett packard ceo mark hurd and his top nine executive vice presidents have been brainstorming to target growth opportunities next
