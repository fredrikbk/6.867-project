private bank "but over the next six months or so i think consumers will be forced to reallocate where they spend and how cutting back in some areas " some of the potential pitfalls as well as the bright spots were evident in the retail sales data from the commerce department overall the increase in retail sales was the strongest growth in more than years however the gains were led by a rise in sales at gasoline stations spurred by oil prices of more than &# a barrel up nearly this year expensive fuel is an obvious drag but the financial crisis is already being felt by consumers who are

downgraded stocks based on the forecast including many consumer focused financial names such as credit card companies mastercard and american express "if we end up in a recessionary environment
