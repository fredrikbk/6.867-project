u k energy bills likely to rise fueling inflation the u k s largest gas supplier centrica plc said friday that rising wholesale gas prices are cutting profits at its retail arm british gas and it is

cutting profits at its retail arm british gas and it is already losing money on some of its industrial supply contracts centrica said it will monitor its pricing policy in the new year but analysts said an increase is almost inevitable as delays to two major u k liquefied natural gas import projects and a lower than expected rise in imports from norway sustain high prices "we expect centrica to
