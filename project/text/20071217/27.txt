eyes on the road what lies ahead for auto industry in the new year eco cars boomers are on car makers minds online edition nor did i anticipate that the geeky toyota prius gas electric hybrid car would achieve mainstream sales success and become the no best selling vehicle in america as of november in the case of large crossovers pickups and minivans where neither honda nor toyotas models have a big mileage advantage over the detroit offerings the japanese manufacturers could very well decide to dip into their superior profit margins to keep sales rolling and avoid laying off their so far non union american and canadian workers predicting the future is a mugs game ask anyone who bet that home prices in the u s would keep going up but its the end of the year and guessing about what lies ahead for the auto business is a fun way to wile away the dark winter hours before lining up predictions for next year i went back to look at a couple of previous year end columns to assess how well my crystal ball has worked the most charitable view is that i could have done worse in december for example i cheerfully predicted that in a growing world economy would lift industry profits including the fortunes of detroits three auto makers "now with the recovery on track car makers will try to raise prices " i wrote "the industrys hope is that well all be making more money so it wont be a big deal " i think i was on target with that one for about minutes i also said that month that the heads of the chevrolet and ford brands were each determined to boost sales for their respective brands to million vehicles a year wrong again in ford and chevy will be fortunate indeed if they crack million in total annual sales based on their performances through the end of november selling more than million vehicles annually in the fragmented u s market is no small feat but sales for toyotas mainstream toyota brand through nov are ahead of both the old champs another venerable detroit tradition the ford vs chevy sales war is largely irrelevant to the new world on the other hand in late i wrote "this year and next will offer a live action test of whether american consumers are prepared to vote with their wallets in a big way in favor of more efficient cars and trucks " that turned out pretty well as journalistic forecasting goes of course i had no idea that gasoline would hover around &# a gallon for most of this past year i also didnt foresee that congress would be on track as of this writing to enact a law calling for the biggest increase in automotive fuel economy in years nor did i anticipate that the geeky toyota prius gas electric hybrid car would achieve mainstream sales success and become the no best selling vehicle in america as of november my call on hybrids i suggested that using electric drive to goose performance would be the next big thing not so much it turns out which is more of a problem for toyotas lexus brand than it is for me now that ive established that predicting future trends based on past results is little better than calling heads or tails or consulting a ouija board here are some things ill be watching for as the new year unfolds the r word the question worrying everyone in the auto business right now is will demand for mass market vehicles in the u s and european markets slump and if so how badly more to the point for consumers is this question how will the industry respond to something that looks and feels like a recession right now it looks as if the big detroit auto makers are trying to get ahead of the falling tide by cutting production so they dont have to offer ridiculous discounts to clear unsold vehicles that strategy while sound from a business point of view gets scary if the competition doesnt play the same game toyota and honda executives still hope to increase sales in the u s next year partly they expect their more fuel efficient models will continue to sell well but in the case of large crossovers pickups and minivans where neither honda nor toyotas models have a big mileage advantage over the detroit offerings the japanese manufacturers could very well decide to dip into their superior profit margins to keep sales rolling and avoid laying off their so far non union american and canadian workers reality chases green hype this years detroit auto show promises to be a field of greens green concept cars that is chrysler for example plans to highlight three greenmobiles including a jeep with a lithium ion diesel hybrid powertrain an electric dodge wagon and a fuel cell vehicle none of these are going to be on the road soon but after general motors stole last years show with a highly conceptual prototype for a plug in hybrid called the chevy volt the auto industry has shed its inhibitions about green wheeling the media with imaginary eco cars beyond that its now crystal clear to the auto industry that whether they believe cars are responsible for climate change or not a significant share of consumers and lawmakers want cars that consume less petroleum so the pressure is on car companies to push real fuel saving innovations off auto show podiums and into production the coming year should mark the leading edge of a wave of fuel saving technologies that will be relatively new to the u s market including high mileage diesel engines clean enough for states bmw for example is expected to show diesel powered models at the detroit auto show next month gm meanwhile is launching its "two mode" hybrid large sport utility vehicles designed to achieve highway mileage in the high s the likelihood that u s fuel efficiency rules will compel car makers fleets to average miles per gallon albeit using credits for "flex fuel" vehicles that never burn a drop of corn liquor means big car makers will have to undertake more technology change under the hood and elsewhere in their models than they have since congress forced a doubling of fuel economy on them in the late s and early s where will the boomer express roll next as those of us from the baby booms peak years flow past the year marker the auto industry will continue to wrestle with figuring out what we want is it nostalgia shameless retro mobiles like the dodge challenger due to hit the market in the new year or the chevrolet camaro coming a year later is the baby boom prepared to head in a more forward looking direction buying up hybrids and other high mileage cars more suitable for the return of environmental consciousness or do all of us just want the cushiest most technology enabled luxury vehicle we can afford as a reward for long years of putting up with our kids my fearless prediction yes eyes on the road will return on jan happy holidays
