the afternoon report premier event online edition russias vladimir putin showed part of his political hand today by saying he would accept the job of prime minister though some wonder what other cards he plans to play mr putin told a confab of his united russia party that he would accept the premiership if his handpicked successor who asked him to take the position wins the countrys march presidential vote thats not exactly a long shot bet as mr putins popularity and the firm hand he keeps on the political system all but ensure the victory of dmitry medvedev a first deputy prime minister chairman of state controlled energy giant oao gazprom and putin protege even so the announcement offers some resolution to the kremlin intrigue and the anxiety among the russian political class that has infused the looming transfer of power as the constitutionally mandated end of mr putins stint as president approaches in his statements today mr putin seemed to indicate that he wouldnt use his new position to undermine the powers of the presidency saying "if the citizens of russia show trust in dmitry medvedev and elect him the new president i would be ready to continue our joint work as prime minister without changing the distribution of authority " for his part mr medvedev played up the role mr putin would have saying "i dont have the slightest doubt that vladimir vladimirovich putin in the future will keep using his enormous political and professional resources his influence both in our society and in the world for the benefit of russia and its citizens " while mr putins announcement the latest in a dribble of news surrounding his successor resolves some uncertainty about how the reins of power will be held plenty remains up in the air in what has become a drawn out process "its like the political equivalent of a strip tease " said sarah mendelson a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies who studies russian politics "you have some idea whats there but youre not exactly sure " ms mendelson said several key questions remain as to mr putins role as prime minister chief among them is where control of the security services would lie there has also been some speculation that mr medvedev could step down as president possibly opening the door for mr putins return the russian constitution bars mr putin from a third consecutive term but not from running again later which he has said he might consider in a brief stint by mr medvedev in the presidency could potentially be used to provide the technical basis mr putin needs to reclaim power ms mendelson said stephen sestanovich a fellow at the council on foreign relations who wrote an op ed on russias economic forecasts in todays journal said he believes mr putin and his team may have considered that option but deemed it to be illegal without changing the constitution "what is right is we dont know what the plan is and this is a gigantic game that putin is playing " mr sestanovich said "and nobody knows how its going to turn out except him " mergers fail to rally stocks a string of deals that harkened back to the frenzied "merger mondays" that were a
