taxes and income in when the top income tax rate was the richest paid only of all income taxes now with a top rate of they pay more than double that share every democrat running for president wants to raise taxes on "the rich " but they will have to do something miraculous to outtax president bush based on the latest available tax data no administration in modern history has done more to pry tax revenue from the wealthy last week the congressional budget office joined the irs in releasing tax numbers for and part of the news is that the richest paid about of all income taxes that year the richest paid a tad less than and the richest paid these tax shares are all up substantially since and even somewhat since meanwhile americans with an income below the median half of all households paid a mere of all income taxes in the richest million tax filers those americans with adjusted gross incomes of more than &# in paid more income tax than all of the million american tax filers below the median in income ten times more for the political left and most of the media this means only that the rich are getting richer so of course theyre paying more taxes and it is true that the top earners have increased their share of total income yet as the nearby table shows the rich showed more rapid gains in reported income shares in the s than in the first half of this decade the share of the richest jumped to of total income in from in but increased only slightly to in this makes it hard to pin their claim of "rising inequality" on the bush tax cuts though the income redistributionists are trying by this measure the clinton years were far worse for "inequality " notably however the share of taxes paid by the top has kept climbing this decade to in from in the share paid by the top has increased even more rapidly in other words despite the tax reductions of and the rich saw their share of taxes paid rise at a faster rate than their share of income how could this be one explanation is that the bush tax cuts reduced the income tax liability of middle and lower income households by more proportionately than the rich the average family of four with an income of &# saw its income tax liability fall by about &# a year from the and tax cuts the irs statistics also tell a more complicated economic story than the media claim first america continues to be a society of upward income mobility over the past decade millions of americans have joined the once highly exclusive club of six and seven figure earners some americans earned &# million or more in annual income in compared to in and in because there is no cap on the top income share this increase in millionaires pushes the top income and taxes paid share higher the number of millionaire households in net worth also increased to nine million in up from six million in according to tns a global market research firm liberals decry this as proof of a new "gilded age " but wed say these gains are a sign that more americans are joining the ranks of the truly affluent more than million american households or about one in had an income of more than &# a year in this is the kind of upward mobility that a dynamic society should want because it means that incomes arent stagnant and opportunity continues to exist keep in mind as well that the irs only records the income that taxpayers report its data dont include income that the rich hide in tax shelters or otherwise defer and there is evidence that lower tax rates since have caused the rich to declare more of what they earn in when the top income tax rate was the richest paid only of all income taxes now with a top rate of they pay more than double that share with lower rates and fewer tax loopholes after the reform there is less incentive to shelter income to avoid tax the irs figures are also misleading because they include income that can make many americans rich for only a single year in for example taxpayers earned an estimated &# billion in income from capital gains which is reported on tax forms as part of adjustable gross income but that might include the one time gain from a middle class senior couple that has lived modestly for decades but suddenly retires and sells the family business or home for &# million or more they may be "rich" in hillary clintons definition of the term but in fact they are benefitting in one tax year from a lifetime of hard work and thrift the amount of capital gains declared on tax forms has doubled since the tax rate was cut to from in which has also contributed to more americans being "rich " dividend income has also increased by at least since that rate was cut to from nearly in so part of the income gains of the rich are simply a result of assets that have been converted into taxable income in part because of lower tax rates we hate to break up the medias egalitarian chorus with these details but facts are facts if democrats really want to soak the rich theyll keep tax rates where they are or better lower them some more see related letter "letters to the editor count all the taxes when talking about income tax" wsj dec
