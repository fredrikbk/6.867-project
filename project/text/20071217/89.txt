translating genes to drugs novartis may be one of the first to get a payoff from latest know how glaxosmithkline plc also has used genomics to develop vaccines against streptococcus and the bacterium that causes meningitis b both are in early stage testing as advances in gene mapping have revealed more about the underpinnings of life pharmaceutical companies have been trying to translate that knowledge into product discoveries novartis ag is among a few companies now showing results its work is raising the potential for a source of new drugs and vaccines for an industry facing dry research pipelines and aging product portfolios a novartis vaccine for a deadly form of meningitis is proving effective in human trials its researchers mapped the genes of the bacterium that causes meningitis b and used the map to develop a vaccine that has produced encouraging results in its first trial in infants the company reported at a meningitis conference in london on nov out of babies in the united kingdom who received two shots of the vaccine to experienced a strong level of protection against three common strains of meningitis b the test is continuing with the infants scheduled to receive another two shots novartis plans to move its experimental vaccine into a much larger test involving thousands of children next year says rino rappuoli an italian scientist who heads novartiss vaccine research the vaccine is still in midstage or phase trials and could still fail in further studies if all goes well the vaccine could reach the market by "i find this incredibly exciting " says craig venter the american biologist who helped novartis decipher the genetics of meningitis b and went on to map the human genome "hopefully this can be a model that can be repeated " the science of gene mapping is called genomics scientists began mapping the genes of bacteria in the early s and novartis and other drug companies are now using these maps to find ways to kill the bacteria with vaccines intercell ag of austria is testing a number of vaccines that it developed from gene maps including one for pneumococcus which causes pneumonia intercell and merck &amp co are jointly developing another genomically derived vaccine for staph infections and glaxosmithkline plc also has used genomics to develop vaccines against streptococcus and the bacterium that causes meningitis b both are in early stage testing after figuring out how to map bacteria scientists moved on to decode the more complicated genetics of humans publishing a full map in some drug companies hoped the human genome would help them speedily discover new drugs that hasnt happened as quickly as some predicted researchers in the past two years have identified about human genes that appear linked to diabetes for example but that knowledge hasnt produced a drug one reason dozens of additional genes probably also play a role in the disease and it is unclear which genes a drug should target also poor diet and other behavioral issues contribute to diabetes and a drug can take as many as years to develop "getting these hints from genetics isnt really close to producing a drug " says david goldstein a geneticist and director of duke universitys center for population genomics and pharmacogenetics he and others say the human genome is helping scientists understand diseases better and should lead to new drugs down the road novartis and other pharmaceutical companies are under big pressure to invent new drugs and vaccines many of the industrys biggest products are facing generic competition leaving companies vulnerable to a sharp fall in sales several of novartiss drugs were hit by generic competition this year contributing to poor third quarter earnings at the company excluding a one time gain from asset sales profit fell over the year earlier quarter to &# billion a meningitis b vaccine could be good business for novartis french drug maker sanofi aventis sa says it expects its vaccine for other forms of meningitis to reach global sales of million euros or about &# million this year in a research note last year bear stearns estimated that a meningitis b vaccine for infants could reach sales of as much as &# billion a year meningitis b is a devastating and unpredictable strain of meningitis a potentially lethal infection in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord it strikes between and people a year world wide killing to of them within hours of infection many of its victims are under one year of age those who arent killed by the disease can suffer brain damage hearing loss and loss of limbs scientists spent decades trying to find a vaccine using traditional methods which include cultivating the pathogen and dissecting it to identify the parts important for inducing immunity dr rappuoli says he got the idea of using a gene map in when dr venter changed science by publishing the first gene map of a living species the bacterium h influenzae which can cause pneumonia dr rappuoli figured if he could understand the genetic makeup of the microbe that causes meningitis b he would have an easier time finding ways to attack it at the time he was running vaccine research for chiron corp which was partly owned by novartis keen to build its vaccines business novartis paid &# billion in to acquire full control of chiron dr rappuoli asked mutual friends to get in touch with dr venter to see if he could help with the meningitis b bacterium in the italian flew to the u s to meet dr venter at the institute for genomic research the center he founded in rockville md "i told him its an interesting disease people die children die and maybe we can help " recalls dr rappuoli dr venter who was paid for his work agreed to use the institutes automated gene sequencing machines to decode all the genes in the meningitis b bacterium with the map in hand dr rappuoli and his team spent two years analyzing the more than genes dr rappuoli says his scientists knew roughly what they were looking for genes that would direct the body to make proteins that would generate antibodies capable of killing the bacteria they used high speed computers to home in on such genes on the surface of the bacteria then they began the years long process of immunizing laboratory mice with all of these proteins they found that several of the proteins stimulated a powerful immune response in the mice
