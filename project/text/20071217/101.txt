your money matters a special report essay hands off the smartest investment advice may be this try not to be so smart thanks to stock splits takeovers and a half century of economic growth those investments have shot up in value whos the best investor in our family ill tell you who isnt any one of our sparkling assortment of ph d scientists lawyers computer engineers and patent holding medical researchers or journalists we high achievers are so eager to catch the next big trend or to dodge trouble that we cant leave our portfolios alone our constant fluttering slashes into our returns yet we cant break the habit each new "insight" seems so powerful that we cant resist the temptation to act on it the one person with the discipline to sit still and let her profits keep growing is my year old mother in law shes a secretarial school graduate who doesnt read the financial pages ask her to explain her investments in detail and she will wave you away with the disarming claim that "i dont know anything about stocks " not true she knew enough as an unmarried young office worker in to get much of her savings into the market her purchases were tiny a few share positions that cost her &# or so apiece but thanks to stock splits takeovers and a half century of economic growth those investments have shot up in value one early change jar investment turned into &# of ingersoll rand stock another became &# of ametek theres a broader lesson in her fold profits and her status as our familys savviest investor being patient is a crucial requirement for successful investing thats easy to say yet it can be excruciatingly hard to do for high achieving type a personalities in fact it can be almost impossible in so many other aspects of life we fare best by catching the a m flight to denver while our competitors are still sleeping or we tear apart a flawed business plan all weekend creating a much better version by monday morning were energetic on the go people that approach has been so rewarding in other aspects of life that we keep splashing it into our investment decisions unwilling to believe that too much commotion is deleterious ive been learning this lesson over and over ever since my first post college job nearly three decades ago one of my early bosses was a master at split second decisions in the workplace john could keep a production line moving as swiftly as anyone then each evening when all the deadlines had been met he would banter loudly with a few friends about the best way to invest his retirement accounts john constantly adjusted his asset mix stocks bonds and cash swirled back and forth in his account like dancers braiding a maypole we never learned the exact amounts involved but it was clear from his tone that he was exasperated most days at how ineffective all his maneuvers turned out to be just before i turned i finally had enough money market savings to justify redeploying that money more adventurously in i picked a mix of respectable mutual funds parked my money there and vowed to leave it alone that promise lasted less than a year my new holdings included an international stock fund which was doing marvelously well the biggest contributor japans then roaring bull market on a business trip to tokyo i thought it would be interesting to size up the local economy firsthand japan didnt look impressive up close tokyo was crammed full of tiny apartments and anxious office workers resorts in the countryside seemed shabby compared with their u s counterparts i decided that japans economy was overrated and that it was time to unload the foreign stock fund entirely locking in some profits oops for the next few years the foreign stock fund kept barreling ahead led by more gains from japans overheated market when the japanese market later turned south other non u s markets picked up the slack eventually i conceded defeat and bought back into that same fund at a much higher price my smarter than the rest of you decision had cost me thousands of dollars calm prevailed for me until mid when asian economies tanked bill clintons presidency looked imperiled and the internet bubble began looking ridiculous convinced that decisive action was called for i yanked my main retirement account out of stocks entirely it seemed like time to park all that money in short term bonds armageddon might be near but id be safe after a few months it was clear that armageddon wasnt happening yes markets had faltered briefly after my clever exit but then they rebounded smartly running to the sidelines had cost me money trying to tidy up this misstep i spent the next three years pursuing choppy inconsistent ways of getting reinvested all through the tech bubbles peak and subsequent crash i did lots of shuffling but didnt achieve any lasting improvements to my portfolio finally in early the logic of buy and hold sank in one more time my wife and i spread our money across a wide range of funds mostly in stocks and vowed not to tinker unduly we targeted a few funds such as our childrens college savings accounts for further contributions otherwise we tried to sit still indirectly of course theres lots of motion in our portfolios professional fund managers make their own judgment calls about what to buy or sell most of our managers tend to stay fully invested but a few do make major moves among asset classes if they think valuations are so far out of line that anomalies can be exploited good for them im at peace with the idea that people who invest for a living can size up the markets meanderings in ways that we amateurs cant maybe they know more maybe they work harder at it maybe they just have the right kind of mental outlook to succeed as warren buffett once remarked "investing doesnt require extraordinary intelligence but it does require an extraordinary temperament " the itch to play personal hunches hasnt disappeared entirely and although i can publicly salute my mother in laws unexpected stock market successes my humility doesnt run deep enough to bow to her buy and hold approach forever so ive come up with another way to reduce the risk that some new brainstorm will lead me to upend our investments yet again ive begun storing financial statements and blank transaction forms in really obscure places some are in a storage locker eight miles from our home others are jammed in the back corners of filing cabinets requiring lots of tugging and shuffling before they can be exhumed theres precedent for this when our children were little we put delicate art objects and sharp knives on high shelves out of reach for curious toddlers it was easier to make them invisible than to be obliged to leap out of our chairs repeatedly shouting "no dont " the kids hardly knew what they were missing and it meant the adults could breathe a lot easier the dynamic hasnt really changed twenty years of investment experience has taught me that restraint is a virtue and that if its too easy to tinker at some point ill succumb this way i keep temptation far enough out of reach to let calmer judgment prevail mr anders is a wall street journal
