sign up for the e mail here it is a mark of these divided times for the international community and american politics that the product of the climate change talks at bali is a "road map" for more talks with no mandate for what they must turn out after two weeks of negotiations aimed at harnessing scientific consensus and prevalent anxiety toward a system for reducing the gases that trap heat in earths atmosphere the countries gathered in indonesia produced an accord that recognizes the need for "deep cuts" in emissions of carbon dioxide and the like to protect the planet but doesnt set targets tells future negotiators to consider binding emission targets for industrialized countries and tells developing countries to work on similar moves urges work on "positive incentives" for halting deforestation in developing countries suggests a search for ways to help poorer counties fend off rising oceans and other effects of global warming and sets a deadline for the next climate accord in order to have it in motion by the time the kyoto protocol expires in "steeped in generalities " as the international herald tribune notes "it avoids all of the politically difficult specifics will the worlds biggest polluters the united states and china accept caps or limits on their emissions as countries in europe have already done how will rich nations help pay the cost of reducing emissions in the developing world if there are emission caps who will face the tightest restrictions industrialized countries which now create the most pollution per person or developing nations which will soon lead in total emissions " china and india were among the opponents of establishing strict global emission targets but the u s was singled out and assailed by participants for resisting even the final agreement until early saturday morning and as the wall street journal reports the bush administration was quick to express "serious concerns" that it could lead to some developing economies getting a better deal than richer nations the white house has also been increasingly isolated on the issue at home where a bipartisan bill introduced this month in the senate would reduce carbon emissions from major sources in the u s some by the new yorker notes the top democratic presidential candidates have proposed plans aimed at cutting emissions and all the top republican contenders to succeed president bush have at least acknowledged global warming as a problem the magazine adds but the bill would seem a likely candidate for white house veto threats and seems among the policy issues that may have to wait until the next administration as recently as friday mr bush suggested that even tough u s budget decisions might be put off for a year as the journal reports democrats last night unveiled a &# billion year end catch all spending bill that "puts their imprint on government priorities ranging from climate change to homeland security and education " and they hope to get mr bushs blessing in time to go home for the holidays but as government executive reports in signing a resolution that kept the budgetless government running for

done " the times says trane the journal notes is the successor company to american standard which was recently split up after the current credit crunch made it difficult for private equity players to get funding to buy the whole thing "at the same time " the journal adds "many companies are cash rich and free to pursue deals that dont depend on debt markets for financing that has opened up opportunities for corporations to pursue major strategic moves without being outbid " amid probes siemens chief to meet with sec siemens chief executive peter loescher and gerhard cromme chairman of

scandal the financial times reports mr loescher the first outsider to lead siemens took the job with promises to make ethical standards his highest priority the ft notes the paper citing a senior siemens director says mr loescher will try to convince the sec he has already taken radical steps toward improvement in the wake of the &# billion in suspicious payments the company has uncovered so

out a substantial part of siemens annual profits " the ft reports and the senior director who is involved in the talks with the u s regulators says that "ultimately the sec is not going to be

stars who sought autonomy from a system controlled by the studios the times reports mr chaplin and his colleagues had names that were far more bankable than those of nearly all hollywood writers still while silicon valley vc players have often been shy of putting money into entertainment start ups deemed less profitable than high tech ventures "they began considering a broader range of entertainment investments after observing the enormous sums paid for popular web video companies " the times says "they also have been emboldened by major advertisers which prefer supporting professionally created web entertainment to backing user generated content on sites such as myspace that can be in poor taste " the writers guild itself is also seeking alternatives and confirmed over the weekend that it will try to negotiate directly with individual production companies "in an effort to break its negotiations impasse with the amptp " variety reports also of note new york times an
