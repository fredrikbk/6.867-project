quickly for retirement and fund their daughters college education both having grown up in new jersey the bermans plan to stay in their home even after retirement though they might consider buying a vacation home in a warmer climate "we dont need to retire to a fancy house in florida we like new jersey just fine " says dr berman finally settling down jed and amanda jones and dont have a huge amount of money set aside for retirement after career moves took them from california to japan to texas in the past decade but theyve recently bought a new house and mr jones started a business and the couple is ready to stay put and start seriously saving "relative to our peers i think we are average in terms of what we have saved for retirement " says mr jones "weve kept our debt low and dont use credit cards but we would have saved a lot more if we hadnt moved so much " the joneses have been saving for a long time even if it hasnt always been as much as they would have liked mr jones a marketing professional in the technology industry opened a traditional ira at the age of when he was teaching english in japan he contributed what he could each year borrowed against the account once

contribute as much as i could but there were a few years after we bought our first house that i couldnt make a full contribution " he says in he accepted a job as brand marketing manager for dell inc in kawasaki japan and the couple sold their home in rancho santa margarita calif before moving overseas they put the &# they pocketed from the sale into a money market account where it stayed untouched until july of this year when they used it to purchase their current home in austin texas in april the joneses returned to the u s and did some serious thinking about where to put down roots though they would have liked to settle in their native southern california they soon realized it was too expensive the couple checked out cities like seattle and phoenix and finally decided on austin "for our financial goals california just did not make sense " says mr jones in round rock a suburb of austin the joneses were able to purchase a five bedroom house and the lower cost of living also has afforded them another opportunity mr jones took a risk to start his own marketing consulting business as mr joness business gets off the ground he plans to sock away the maximum in the couples two roth iras as well as make regular contributions to two mutual fund accounts a money market account and plans for his childrens college education the couple hasnt thought a lot about when they will retire but mr jones believes owning his own business will give him the financial freedom to stop working before if he chooses even if they retire early they plan to keep active into their later years either working part time or volunteering "we arent the type of people who could just sit around and do the golf thing " says mr jones for the time being the erstwhile globetrotters are happy in austin "we plan to stay put for a long time " says mr jones "every time we moved there was a transaction cost involved and it negatively impacted our savings but now we can just focus on building a solid financial future " taking your own advice robert and martha stebbins have inside knowledge when it comes to figuring out how to best save for the future as vice president of retirement services firm pension specialists inc mr stebbins spends to hours a week thinking about retirement plans "i spend my day setting up iras and k plans for companies so i am immersed in the world of retirement " says the year old mr stebbins "being involved in this industry has definitely made me aware of the importance of saving for the future " even before he landed in the retirement business a decade ago mr stebbins had an eye on the future shortly after graduating from georgetown university in with a degree in history he opened an ira and funded it with what he could just &# at the time his first job out of college was as a paralegal at a washington d c law firm which is where he met martha now who was also working there as a paralegal while she contributed a small amount to a k at the firm ms stebbins says she didnt think much about saving until she met robert who urged her to open her own ira soon after they started dating in the couple married and they soon moved to san francisco mr stebbins landed a job at an investment firm where he started putting of his salary into a k ten years ago he started working at pension specialists and is now a part owner of the company he contributes the maximum to his k but also believes his ownership of the firm for which he had to invest a significant amount of money is part of the couples retirement savings "if the company takes off i could be done working by the time im in my mid s " says mr stebbins "the equity i hold in my company is a huge part of our retirement savings " ms stebbins a social worker recently left her job when her second son was born during the past five years she worked at a state run psychiatric hospital that offered a defined benefit program to employees shell receive a small amount of pension income from that plan when she reaches retirement age ms stebbins also continues to contribute the maximum to her ira and has some k savings from two previous jobs she held before going back to school to get her masters degree in social work the stebbins believe they are on track for a comfortable retirement by the age of and could retire sooner if mr stebbinss business interest pays off they own a home in the san francisco suburb of alameda which they purchased seven years ago with a year fixed rate mortgage and which they have never tapped for equity they also dabble in the stock market hold a few mutual funds and own an investment property in bellingham wash which they may sell down the road to fund the college educations of their two sons now years old and months old "i see every day that many people are not doing enough to save for their retirement " says mr stebbins whose advice to everyone he knows is "save and then save some more " for their part the stebbins have used software programs to extrapolate how much savings theyll need in the future "i go to sleep every night knowing we have a plan " says mr stebbins and with the wild card of mr stebbinss business the couple is hoping theyll be able to "retire" in less than years but they wont just "go sit in a beach chair somewhere " says mr stebbins the couples vision of early retirement includes working part time traveling and volunteering mr stebbins may keep his hand in the company but work only a few days a week while ms stebbins envisions working during the school year she loves her chosen career and then taking the entire summer off to travel "for us retirement is having the freedom to live our lives with no financial constraints " says mr stebbins saving more aggressively lisa griffis is a realist "i know at my age i should be putting away of my salary but i cant afford to do that as a single woman living in america today " says the year old ms griffis "i feel like im doing pretty well considering i own my home im not in debt and i dont overspend " the year old cleveland resident recently bought a house and started funding a k with of her income as a newspaper page designer at the cleveland plain dealer ms griffis didnt start saving for retirement until her s spending her early career in a succession of creative jobs including photojournalist and art editor at newspapers across the country the jobs didnt pay very well and ms griffis often had little left over for savings "i always wanted to do photojournalism but its not the best paying career and i often scraped for the rent each month " she says when ms griffis started her career years ago few companies offered k plans it wasnt until she started working in florida for the palm beach post that she began to think seriously about retirement savings putting of her salary into a k plan she bought a home in florida but lost money on the sale five years later at her next job at the cincinnati enquirer ms griffis also participated in the company k to the tune of of her salary she is proud of the fact she has never borrowed against her k savings "i have never borrowed from my retirement savings because i feel that money should not be touched until youre " says ms griffis "a k is not an atm " in her early s ms griffis began to save more aggressively she bought a home in cleveland in with a year mortgage and began putting of her salary in a k she has kept up that saving rate except for lowering it temporarily to to pay off credit card debt racked up buying a new wardrobe after she lost pounds ms griffis once dabbled in the stock market but ended up losing money "i realized i was not cut out for stock investing when i sold apple right before it introduced the ipod " she says laughing though the housing market has been hit particularly hard in the cleveland area ms griffis isnt worried about her homes diminishing value as she plans to stay put until the mortgage is paid off she would like to be able to retire at but ms griffis knows she may need to work until age or later and whether shes working at a newspaper or doing her own consulting work ms griffis doesnt really mind the prospect of remaining in the work force into her later years "living in florida ive seen what happens when people pull the plug too early and end up spending their days worrying about the early bird special " she says "i love what i do so i hope to continue doing something with design photography or writing as long as i live " clipping coupons is just the start can clipping coupons add up to substantial retirement savings by itself probably not but as part of a frugal way of life it can certainly help oren spiegler refers to himself as the "king of coupons " and he takes saving seriously finding many ways to put aside money for retirement he and his wife colleen arent just on track to retire comfortably rather they are set to make a higher income in retirement than they do today thanks in part to a generous pension plan and a recent inheritance that went straight into savings "i am a champion shopper " says mr spiegler who has thousands of coupons on file and scans newspaper circulars for new ones each week "saving money is my hobby and ill happily drive across town to get a good deal " he says coupons save the couple at least &# a year while ms spiegler sometimes wonders why they need packs of toilet paper or bags of frozen vegetables which her husband recently purchased at the price of cents a bag with coupons she says shes learning to be frugal and is impressed with their &# a week grocery bill "oren is a financial wizard and his habits have rubbed off on me " says ms spiegler who paid off all her credit card debt in when the couple married the basement of the spieglers home in upper saint clair pa is stocked floor to ceiling with food and household supplies bought on the cheap the spieglers only buy clothes at department store closeout sales and use a credit card that pays a rebate paying off the balance in full each month all that saving helps the spieglers sock away a tidy sum in retirement savings mr spiegler has worked for the commonwealth of pennsylvania for years and currently serves as an administrative hearing officer his government job provides him with a classic pension which will enable him to earn of his salary for life if he works for the state until the age of on top of that mr spiegler contributes the maximum currently &# a year including the "catch up contributions" allowed to people age and over to a plan the equivalent of a k plan for government employees he also contributes the maximum currently &# to a roth ira each year and invests any leftover savings in mutual funds which he researches online and in investment magazines ms spiegler an assistant for the pittsburgh chapter of the national multiple sclerosis society also puts the maximum into a roth ira and her b plan a k equivalent for employees of nonprofit organizations the spieglers inherited &# when mr spieglers mother passed away two years ago but they didnt spend any of it preferring to invest it all in mutual funds the couple reckon theyll have more than &# million saved by the age of not counting mr spieglers pension income and if mr spiegler works until age which he plans to do because he loves his job the spieglers will make a higher yearly income in retirement than they do today "my goal is to have a comfortable six figure income in retirement by withdrawing just of my savings per year and im well on track to achieve that " says mr spiegler who wants to write a book or dabble in journalism when he retires ms spiegler for her part would love to retire early and plans to stop working as soon as its financially possible though the spieglers are champion savers they dont feel deprived in the least they take vacations each year to places like florida and los angeles skipping more expensive destinations like europe and new york and eat out on a regular basis mr spiegler meticulously researches deals on hotels and airfares and they often eat at buffet restaurants "i guess you could say we are very much ahead of the game compared to other people our age " says mr spiegler "but i find saving fun and guess im just a magnet for bargains " living for today for the first time in his life michael dorin isnt saving much money but hes never been happier the year old sales and marketing director recently moved from a small town in northern massachusetts to manhattan and is "eating into retirement savings" to enjoy a city lifestyle "i decided that following my heart is more important than mindlessly saving for a future i may not even have " says mr dorin "i would rather be happy today than live my life only looking ahead " mr dorin hasnt always lived by such a code in fact he spent most of his life as a model saver by living modestly and never running up a balance on credit cards he managed to save over of his income in the past six years even on a moderate salary but mr dorin wasnt happy living in bedford mass and had always wanted to live in new york city so he negotiated with his employer scientific solutions inc a north chelmsford mass manufacturer of optical equipment used in scientific instruments to let him work remotely from new york six months ago he moved to manhattan and his cost of living nearly tripled but hes not concerned "for once in my life i can truly say i am not worried about money " says mr dorin "i believe i will find a way to make enough to support myself throughout my later years so im not distracted by my future at this point " that said mr dorin does save in a roth ira which he opened last year as a complement to a traditional ira he opened years ago at the suggestion of his father he contributed what he could to the ira every year and started putting in the maximum six years ago when he started his job at scientific solutions he plans to continue funding the roth ira with the maximum contribution his company doesnt offer a k plan but does allow employees to participate in a sep ira mr dorin decided not to participate in that plan because he wasnt impressed with the fund options available to him and has instead socked away cash in money market accounts moving to new york isnt the first time mr dorin has followed his heart to a big city after he graduated from boston university with a degree in astronomy in he headed for paris where he spent seven years recording music and working as a translator even though he made very little money he managed to save more than &# by living extremely frugally this time however hes determined to enjoy all new york has to offer even if that means tapping into his savings "i dont want to look back at my life and realize i missed out on experiences because i was too busy clipping coupons and scrimping " says mr dorin "when i lived in paris i didnt do a lot of things i wanted like travel or eat out in nice restaurants and i regret that now " even though hes living for today mr dorin does think about the future he would love to retire early but realizes hell probably need to work until at least if not longer however mr dorin believes if hes doing work he enjoys he will want to continue working as long as hes physically able even it thats well into his s or s since hes not counting on social security and doesnt think he can save enough at this point to retire somewhere like new york he would also consider retiring abroad perhaps in south america "you practically have to be a millionaire to retire with an acceptable quality of life in the u s " he says for now mr dorin is enjoying his lifestyle in manhattans chelsea neighborhood and plans to stay in new york at least for three more years after that hes not sure where the winds will take him but hes determined to enjoy life to the fullest wherever he lands ms essick is a writer in california she can be reached at reports wsj com
