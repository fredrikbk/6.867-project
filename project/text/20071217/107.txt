start a business while keeping family friction and financial risk to a minimum before you even begin to discuss money determine whether your childs idea for a business stems from a true passion or whether its just a passing fancy especially if he or she is leaving college or a good job in order to pursue the venture "without taking away from their ideas try to understand how serious they are about starting a business " says paul kedrosky senior fellow at the ewing marion kauffman foundation in kansas city mo and venture partner at canadas largest venture capital firm ventures west management inc evaluate how much time effort and money they have put into the project already ask such questions as how long have you been thinking about this idea what research have you done on the market what people in the industry have you spoken to then instead of telling your children what to do help them find the answers on their own "if you dont listen to their ideas from the beginning they may go ahead with the project and youll get locked out of the process completely " mr kedrosky says most important ask your child how he or she came up with the idea does their business provide a solution for a problem they or their friends personally face "if they are scratching their own itch their product or business will also be solving a problem for someone else " mr kedrosky says three years ago while at pace university in new york city david askaripour saw a need for students to get notes from classes they couldnt attend because of an illness or vacation he created a web site where students could buy and sell each others class notes online "before i asked my parents for money i spent months running the numbers researching competitors and programming and came up with a proposal " he says but mr askaripours father did not initially understand the idea the son spent weeks explaining the web site to his father using specific charts and numbers meanwhile to raise money he took on an additional job and sold his car and his &# leather jacket his father eventually understood the concept and his sons determination "once i saw how hard he was working i was convinced and loaned him &# " davids father aziz askaripour says to keep both finances and the relationship with your child intact it is important to do your homework says nicole hall editor in chief of the smart borrower center at the charlotte n c based web site lendingtree com llc although its not necessary to initially involve a lawyer consult a financial adviser or tax expert to make sure you are not jeopardizing current living or retirement plans "only loan what you can afford to lose " ms hall says also keep your commitments to other children and their future endeavors in mind mr roman says he had an "honest as hell" discussion about finances with his family when his son approached him with an idea he hatched with two classmates at brown university the few thousand dollars mr roman wound up investing in amiestreet com was "only as much as we could afford to lose without it having any negative impact on our own lifestyle and relationship with elias " he says the business more recently has drawn investment from amazon com inc as well no matter how simple you make a loan or investment agreement put it in writing says andrew j sherman a partner at washington d c based law firm dickstein shapiro llp verbal agreements can get fuzzy after a few years consider a written contract just another part of your childs education about the way the world works if you agree to make a loan write down the specific terms interest and a payment schedule "it instills discipline into the transaction and creates fairness " mr sherman says although an easy payment schedule can be reasonable research current interest rates and tax ramifications on web sites like lendingtree com or the internal revenue services own irs gov if possible consult third party sources for additional advice if you wish to make an investment in your childs company you should first consult securities and exchange commission rules if your income or net worth is below a certain level your investment could place a regulatory burden on the company because of sec rules meant to safeguard the interests of small investors a stake held by a third party also could be seen as an unwelcome complication by a venture capitalist or other potential investors if the company goes public in either case set limits persuade your child that you arent an atm for their venture by linking your loan or investment to a specific business purpose or goal for instance if your child is manufacturing something the contract could say your capital is to finance the first products made when the first phase ends you might require that another investor be sought such as venture capital or an angel investment "you want to build bridges with your contribution not peninsulas " mr kedrosky says in addition to drawing up a contract coordinate expectations with your children says bonnie drew senior executive vice president for youngbiz international a company that educates young people in financial literacy and entrepreneurship at the very least ms drew recommends corresponding with your child about the business every two weeks ask your children to tell you about their progress and obstacles and listen carefully learn about the industry or business on your own too so you can contribute to the discussion inform your children of the obligations they are assuming by accepting money from you such as hearing you out on business decisions give advice gently and get involved directly in the business only when your child is making a "gross mistake lying to you violating the law or squandering large amounts of money in a useless way " mr kedrosky says consider the resources at your disposal and ask your child how you can be most helpful do you have office space equipment or expertise to offer can your business get certain products at wholesale prices another option is paying rent and other expenses for your children while they work for a couple of years to save money for their business venture in addition mentors can be invaluable for entrepreneurs chances are you already know one or more people who have started a company set your child up with one of them if you dont have an entrepreneurial background yourself scan family and friends for volunteers and resources in legal matters tax issues and even product design or development marcia meyers the director of personnel for the city of oakland calif is the mother of joshua boltuch a co founder of amiestreet com along with elias roman ms meyers says she tries to provide human resources and legal advice to her son meanwhile mr romans father who owns a strategic marketing consultancy says he spent months working with the co founders interviewing amiestreet com customers to understand and improve the sites user satisfaction levels "but in the end i know its not my business " the elder mr roman warns "i can offer the team a resource but then i back off and let them make a decision " keep in mind that start up ideas change direction often and that even if a business fails part of the process of discovery as an entrepreneur is to make mistakes if there is any time to take risks it is before your child has any serious financial commitments mr askaripour discontinued his class notes web site after seven months he generated some return from participating schools he says but students began using the site for plagiarizing papers he also says he didnt realize the high cost of running a business he now intends to repay his parents for their loan out of the profits of his new business his parents remain patient in the meantime "i worked hard for my money " the elder mr askaripour says "and david will also have to work for it and pay me back in the future " david askaripours new business is his own web publishing company askaripour media inc which includes a networking site for young entrepreneurs mindpetals com mr askaripour says the site attracts more than unique visitors a day now he says despite initial troubles "my parents saw their investment pay off in how much i learned in order to get where i am today " if a company does well the payback for parents depends on the type and amount of their contribution those who lent money should expect to be repaid on whatever terms both parties agreed upon for parents who bought a stake in their childs company it is reasonable to expect a share of the payout if the company goes public if on the other hand your contribution was in the form of time and guidance then knowing your child has been successful and learned in the process is often enough ms banjo is a staff reporter for the
