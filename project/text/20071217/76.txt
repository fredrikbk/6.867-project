as the "bloodiest extreme knitting tournament " sock wars requires each participant to knit a pair of socks for another player and ship them off to the target players are eliminated from the contest or "killed" when like ms williams they receive the socks once they receive their socks participants have to ship to their assassins the pair they were still working on for their own targets the assassins then must finish those socks and send them along hoping that they dont first receive their own killer socks from another assassin the last assassin standing or sitting wins participants say sock wars brings out bloodthirsty instincts in the knitting community and sets hearts pounding each time these women and a few men check the mail when the fateful package comes "you stand there as if you really were dead " says ms williams a chef in cape may n j sock wars is a twist on the game assassin whose other variations require participants to shoot assigned target players with water pistols or nerf weapons or tag them with spoons such games are played a lot on college campuses julie gardner a free lance tv and film production manager near belfast northern ireland got the idea for sock wars last year after hearing a radio report on streetwars an urban assassin style tournament involving water guns ms gardner was planning a follow up to an online knitting contest she had run and immediately was drawn to the idea of pitting knitters against one another like assassins locked in mortal combat "the whole knitting is the new yoga cliche had been irritating a good few of us " says ms gardner "i wanted a wicked edge to it " the first edition of sock wars held last year attracted more than participants and spawned at least one imitator death by socks participants in this years contest which began oct hail from around the world including the u s the united kingdom australia new zealand belgium and finland ms gardner says she hopes to line up corporate sponsors for next years event and open it up to more knitters sock wars offers a view into a global community of knitting fanatics who are increasingly connected by the web and email the knitters swap patterns and stage "knitalongs " where they work on projects simultaneously and share advice and photos a social network called ravelry www ravelry com has sprung up for knitters and crocheters other online events include the sockapalooza handknit sock exchange the socktoberfest sock knitting festival and the knitting olympics which awarded virtual gold medals that participants could display on their blogs if they started and completed a knitting project during the winter olympics socks are a favorite for knitting events because theyre portable possible for beginners and veteran knitters alike and dont require a lot of expensive yarn at the beginning of sock wars ms gardner provides each player with the name address and shoe size of a target she also designs an original pattern everyone has to follow ms gardner called the one last year "the international sock of doom " this years pattern is "scar " and has a ridge down the side meant to resemble one participants are free to add their own flourishes one knitted the words "sock wars" on one heel and a skull and crossbones on the other theyve also devoted a lot of energy to the delivery of the socks packaging them with flowers and cheeky notes linda cameron of hamilton n d says her assassin enclosed a sympathy card and a package of corn chowder mix one male knitters assassin hand delivered his socks last year about six men participated in the contest this year one of them uvon tucker of chicago received pink socks "a little disheartening since im a guy " says mr tucker a marketing assistant at a retirement community some postulate that men whose feet tend to be bigger have a slight advantage in sock wars because larger socks can take longer to knit participants post photos of the completed socks online with some dramatizing their assassination using fake blood or by lying on the floor beneath the pair they received after her sock wars death heidi imbody of boyertown pa posted a poem to the yahoo groups site used to coordinate the contest it begins "here she lies brokenhearted she had one sock complete and the second one started " participants have employed various tactics to improve their odds kathryn donaldson of arlington va knit until a m the night ms gardner posted the sock wars pattern leann nassar of half moon bay calif paid &# to send her socks by fedex for next day delivery adrienne olszewska of lancashire england bribed her children with candy and tv so she could devote more time to her socks "im knitting go off and leave me alone " ms olszewska says she told her kids but sock wars is as much about luck as it is about knitting skill since players success depends on the speed of the person targeting them and in turn the speed of the person targeting the assassin the time it takes for shipping unfinished socks from those assassinated to their assassins also helps prolong the contest and makes the outcome less predictable ms donaldson was just a few minutes from finishing a pair of socks for her target kathy doughty when on oct she picked up at the post office the package with the socks that did her in ms donaldson a retiree then packaged up the socks she was working on for ms doughty and shipped them off to her assassin ms doughty still hasnt received them and calculates the nearly completed socks destined for her had been held by nine different participants with each of them dying before they could finish their knitting "i thought i was so doomed " said ms doughty a scientist in santa barbara calif who has been knitting for years as of dec there were knitters still standing in sock wars ii ms nassar a year old executive assistant was among them she had been anxiously checking her mail lately one day a package for her husband made her heart race the following afternoon she walked up and stuck her key in the lock on her mailbox "this is bad " she muttered as she turned it ms nassar leaned down and poked her head in then let out a loud shriek "mail hasnt come " she said laughing in the interest of bringing the competition to a close ms gardner on dec told the remaining participants that the first one to get a postcard to her home would take first place postcards from ms olszewska and ms nassar arrived on dec ms gardner declared ms nassar the victor since "the god of war" placed her card at the top of the pile in the mailbox "i have the silliest grin on my face " reports ms nassar her prize a pair of socks
