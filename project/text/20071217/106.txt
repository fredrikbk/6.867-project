your money matters a special report ways to make your kids financially savvy the self control needed to delay gratification is associated not only with good saving habits but also with things like succeeding in school and coping better with frustration and stress scoffing at wealth i have also encouraged my kids to be suspicious of displays of opulence whether its the big house the fancy car or the designer clothes ten years after i am dead and gone i suspect only two people will give much thought to me and their names are henry and hannah theyre my legacy so i hope they thrive and i sure hope they remember me fondly henry and hannah are of course my children now ages and respectively like any parent i spend a lot of time thinking about my kids including how i can best help them financially this isnt simply about coughing up dollars and cents though the sums involved have been frighteningly large rather what its really about is passing along values yes i want my kids to be financially successful but mostly i want them to be competent contented managers of their own money so they dont spend their lives agonizing over their finances and dogged by foolish mistakes i am not claiming to have the road map for every parent we all have different values different incomes and strong ideas about how best to raise children and you will likely scoff at some of the things ive done with that caveat here are a dozen ways i have endeavored to help my kids financially  waiting until later if children are to grow up to be successful savers and investors they need to learn two key skills how to delay gratification and how to take risks prudently the first is easily the most important indeed the self control needed to delay gratification is associated not only with good saving habits but also with things like succeeding in school and coping better with frustration and stress yet this isnt an easy skill to teach henry and hannah grew up spending their parents cash so they didnt have much incentive to curb their desires my response make them feel like theyre spending their own money one of my early tricks was the soda game which i learned about from a reader when my children were young and we went to restaurants i would give them a choice they could have a soda or they could have &# henry and hannah ended up drinking a lot of water  asking themselves emboldened by the soda games success i looked for other ways to apply the same notion the breakthrough came when hannah was and henry was that was when i opened a savings account for each of them the accounts came with a cash machine card every three months since then i have deposited pocket money for them in their savings accounts and as they have grown older their clothing allowance as well that way theyve had to learn to budget for a three month period more important they no longer ask me for money instead if they want to buy something they have to ask themselves the effect has been startling henry and hannah almost immediately became more careful spenders sound manipulative youd better believe it but i also think of it as financial self defense suppose henry and hannah dont learn good money skills and grow up to be financial deadbeats if they ended up deeply in debt i cant imagine not helping at which point their financial problems would be mine  talking the talk i havent just molded henry and hannah with financial incentives i have also used family stories values are passed down to our children in the stories we tell my children may live in an affluent household in an affluent town but i want them to know that their mother and i struggled financially and that they will likely have their own struggles so i talk about the mouse and cockroach infested brooklyn apartment where we all lived while their mother worked on her ph d and we squeaked by on a junior reporters salary i tell them about the beaten up camaro that used to stall if the traffic light stayed red too long i recount taking them as toddlers to the "toy museum " otherwise known as fao schwarz where we would play with the dolls and the trains but never buy instead of regaling my children with these tales i could simply lecture them about the virtues of thrift but the stories pack far more punch  scoffing at wealth i have also encouraged my kids to be suspicious of displays of opulence whether its the big house the fancy car or the designer clothes the fact is this sort of spending doesnt lead to lasting happiness but it can create a heap of financial stress in belittling conspicuous consumption i may be a little too strident but theres a reason henry and hannah may have grown up hearing about the dilapidated brooklyn apartment but i grew up hearing a far more powerful story about my maternal grandfather and his four siblings who in the s each inherited what today would be millions of dollars my grandfathers siblings quickly blew the money on fast cars and high living my grandfather blew his money more slowly on horses and cattle farming either way the great family fortune was gone and reckless spending was largely to blame  compounding for decades when my children were young i opened a variable annuity for each of them this isnt a product i particularly like because many have outrageously high annual expenses and charge back end sales commissions if you sell within say the first seven years still there are a few no load variable annuities with low annual expenses notably the offerings from fidelity investments and vanguard group moreover unlike with an individual retirement account you dont need earned income to fund a variable annuity so you can open an account for a toddler today my kids low cost variable annuities are each worth some &# i have long been captivated by the idea of starting henry and hannah on the road to retirement think about it the dollars i invested when they were youngsters might enjoy six decades of tax deferred compounding thats enough to turn &# into over &# assuming an annual return and thanks to the tax penalty on early withdrawals my children will be discouraged from touching the money before they are  growing free there are far better investment vehicles than a variable annuity and my chance came a few years ago hannah got a job at a local restaurant which meant she had earned income that allowed me to open a roth individual retirement account for her which will give hannah tax free growth instead i could have funded a regular ira where withdrawals are taxable but you get an initial tax deduction that tax deduction however wouldnt have been worth much given hannahs low tax rate so the roth seemed like a better bet the money ive stashed in my kids variable annuities and in hannahs roth ira wont be nearly enough to pay for their retirement especially once you figure in inflation but fully funding their retirement was never my aim rather the accounts are intended to be a powerful example showing my children how money will grow if they are willing to sit quietly with a diverse collection of low cost funds  heading home when i bought my first home my parents helped me financially and i want to do the same for my kids to that end i have invested &# for each of them even with a decade or more of growth that &# probably wont be nearly enough for a down payment but it will give them something to build on i stashed hannahs &# in a target date mutual fund thats geared toward while henrys money is in a fund i bought those funds knowing my kids probably wont buy homes until five or years after those dates my thinking target date funds typically have around half their money in stocks as of their target date and then they continue to become more conservative in the years that follow by the time my kids need their down payment money their target date funds should be largely invested in bonds  keeping score when my kids buy a house they wont just need a down payment they will also want to have a good credit score with that in mind i listed hannah as a joint account holder on my visa card earlier this year that meant the cards credit history was added to her previously blank credit report suddenly she looked like a model financial citizen that allowed her a few months later to apply for a discover card on her own i now have her on a strict regimen where she charges a small sum each month and dutifully pays it off thus slowly building up a good credit score when henry reaches college age i will go through the same nonsense with him this alas is necessary nonsense the reality is a good credit score will help my kids get a lower mortgage rate lower insurance premiums and a host of other financial benefits  vowing to help full disclosure i am divorced but even before my marriage broke up i was horrified by the way many families blow &# or &# on a single day of celebration for a wedding to put such spending in context consider this according to the federal reserves survey of consumer finances more than of households headed by someone to had some savings but the median value of these financial assets including things like checking accounts stocks and mutual funds was just &# spending &# on a party is not one of my values and ive made sure my kids know it i have told them i will give them &# toward a wedding or at age whichever comes first what if they want the &# wedding they can ask their mother  lending a hand while an expensive wedding is low on my list of priorities a good education ranks near the top my ex wife and i long ago agreed that we would pay the full cost of our childrens undergraduate education again this was something my parents did for me and we all tend to be heavily influenced by our parents behavior there is however a limit to my generosity i have told henry and hannah that if they want to go on to graduate school they will have to take out loans i may relent somewhat when the time comes but i think that there should be some cost to staying in school so i am not inclined to continue footing the full tab  setting expectations as you might gather i have talked to my kids a fair amount about money they know they will graduate college debt free they will get some help toward a house down payment and they will receive just &# toward a wedding they know about the retirement accounts i have also promised them &# upon graduating college to get them started in the world no doubt some folks will think im overly generous while others might consider me cheap many will question my priorities for instance folks have told me that they would have skipped the retirement accounts and allocated more toward a house down payment but frankly the precise sums arent that important instead what i am striving to do is set expectations by detailing everything to henry and hannah i have made it clear where i think my financial responsibility ends and where theirs will begin  getting educated along the way i have also endeavored to teach my kids about sensible investing its been a slow process for instance earlier this decade i tried a family investment contest we all picked a mutual fund i invested &# a month in each and then we tracked who fared best i thought the competition would grab their interest but it wasnt a great success maybe henry and hannah were too young indeed i have continued to show them their mutual fund statements as they arrive in the mail and my kids have grown more interested as they have grown older they have also become more curious about the financial markets and i can now chat about investing for at least seconds before they reach for their ipods i hope enough of this will stick and they will grow up to be prudent managers of their own money the potential savings are huge a financial adviser might charge of a portfolios value each year and then recommend mutual funds that cost another what if my children learn to build their own index fund portfolios that cost a mere a year when their portfolios hit &# million they will pay just &# a year in investment costs instead of the &# they would be paying if they used an adviser and with any luck they will remember whom to thank mr clements who is based in new york writes the getting going column for the wall street journal he can be reached at jonathan clements wsj
