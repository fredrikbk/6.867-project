will a twist on an old vow deliver for dominos pizza dominos made its name in pizza delivery by running ads that offered a discounted or free pie if the driver didnt arrive within minutes of an order overall growth in the pizza category has flattened and the prevalence of discounting has made it harder for chains to increase their prices in order to offset rising costs of everything from cheese to oregano ann arbor mich its been years since dominos last promised to deliver a pizza to someones door within minutes but that pledge is still stuck in many customers heads now the chain is trying to hearken back to that hardy ad campaign this time without getting sued dominos made its name in pizza delivery by running ads that offered a discounted or free pie if the driver didnt arrive within minutes of an order but in a st louis woman who was involved in an auto accident with a dominos delivery person sued the company on the grounds that the minute pledge led to accidents dominos later settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed sum that the company says was in the seven figure range and fearing a wave of similar lawsuits abandoned the promise ever since then the company has struggled to craft an equally distinctive marketing message "i dont think there was a time in my nine years here where we didnt whine about how we wish we could just put the minute guarantee back " says dominos pizza inc s chief executive david brandon delivery times also slowed without the guarantee to motivate workers after hiring a new advertising agency dominos now plans to rebrand itself around a play on the old slogan new ads slated to start running christmas eve will carry the tagline "you got minutes " the idea is to tell customers that ordering from dominos gives them back minutes they would have spent rustling up a meal but it stops short of promising delivery in a half hour the question is whether that slogan is close enough to the old guarantee to help dominos stand out again in a cluttered market dominated by independent local pizzerias and discounts mr brandon estimates that about of everything sold in the pizza category is discounted in some way since last year dominos same store sales growth at u s locations has been declining and the companys net income also has fallen other large pizza chains also have been struggling to increase sales and profit overall growth in the pizza category has flattened and the prevalence of discounting has made it harder for chains to increase their prices in order to offset rising costs of everything from cheese to oregano dominos founder thomas monaghan practically invented the modern pizza delivery business when he started the company in the nearby town of ypsilanti in in dominos began advertising its promise of a free pizza if the order failed to arrive within minutes some customers would turn off their porch lights to try to delay the delivery person the company later changed the free pizza to a &# discount for late deliveries after abandoning the guarantee in the wake of the st louis lawsuit dominos began playing up the taste and quality of the pizzas themselves but that left its ads looking more like those of competitors pizza hut papa johns and mom and pop pizzerias this summer dominos set out to find a new agency to replace wpp groups jwt the agency crispin porter + bogusky of miami spent time with dominos franchisees and was struck by how much of the chains culture still centered on speed inside the shops research found that as many as of dominos customers still remembered it as the minute delivery chain even though those ads hadnt run since bill clintons first year as president meantime delivery had become an even more important part of american culture because of online shopping and movie delivery "our targets need isnt for pizza " says ken calwell dominos chief marketing officer "its for convenience " the agency looked at bringing back the minute guarantee but decided there was no legally safe way to do it "we knew the historical baggage that surrounded it so the mission became how do we use the equity that takes advantage of the historical link " but is "appropriate" legally says jeff hicks chief executive of crispin to better understand customers crispin went to the dormitories and apartments of dominos patrons and those of competitors crispin videotaped people buying and eating pizza a new profile of dominos customers emerged the company calls them "fast and simple" consumers who among other things are young people who seek immediate gratification and rely heavily on technology dominos decided to shift its target to consumers and under down from as old as age crispin thought it could revive the minute idea by positioning it instead as a gift of time to customers the new ads show funny scenes of people using their time waiting for the pizza to hang out with friends or do an exercise video faux coupons for instance say theyre "good for minutes of video game smack talking " dominos also plans to rely more on digital advertising and clever marketing on its pizza boxes using them more as cereal makers do inside its shops dominos is trying to cut the time it takes to fill orders and get them out the door but dominos executives say theyre looking for speedier service only inside their kitchens delivery people are told to drive below the speed limit mr brandon also says dominos lawyers carefully vetted the new campaign "i dont want to be the captain of the ship that goes back into court " he says
