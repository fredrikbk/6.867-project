why economists are betting a recession wont happen the fed which has cut its main target for short term interest rates by a full percentage point since august is expected to ease rates through the middle of next year to cushion the economy from housing and credit woes and officials are experimenting with new tools in an effort to ease the credit crunch and encourage banks to keep lending to worthy borrowers the s&amp p case shiller index a popular measure of home prices that has shown steep price declines has limited geographic coverage perhaps overstating the extent to which the housing sectors declines will weigh on consumers with the financial markets in turmoil and house prices sagging there is a lot of talk that a recession is all but inevitable yet theres a case that the economy might avoid a painful downturn in the latest wsj com survey of economists forecasters on average put the chance of a recession often defined as two straight quarterly declines in gross domestic product at thats the highest in more than three years but the forecasters best bet right now is that the u s will skirt a recession "a lot of the underlying resilience of the u s economy seems a bit unappreciated " says citigroup economist steven wieting "its not clear that this is so large a burden that we cant muddle through this " predicting the economys path is especially difficult at turning points and the economy is sending mixed signals but here are some reasons why the economy might avoid the ditch the fed is on the case the fed which has cut its main target for short term interest rates by a full percentage point since august is expected to ease rates through the middle of next year to cushion the economy from housing and credit woes and officials are experimenting with new tools in an effort to ease the credit crunch and encourage banks to keep lending to worthy borrowers the feds actions may have already helped recessions typically dont begin when rates are this low says joseph lavorgna chief u s economist at deutsche bank the federal funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks peaked at an inflation adjusted in the current cycle far lower than the peak before the recession and the high before the downturn "were putting a lot of faith in the fed " mr lavorgna says "a proactive fed and low rates to begin with are very powerful factors behind keeping us out of recession " strong global growth is propping up the u s economy global economic growth is raising demand for u s goods offsetting softer domestic consumption emerging markets which buy more than half of u s exports continue to grow some at an accelerating pace even as industrialized economies cool a weakening dollar in part due to the feds easing of interest rates will help carry the economy through its rough patch it will help make u s exports more attractive to foreign consumers and help u s producers that compete with foreign producers moreover foreign companies may capitalize further on the falling dollar by investing more in the u s for example by buying stock in american companies or setting up their own factories in the u s the economy is still creating jobs supporting incomes the job market is signaling a modest slowdown in hiring but not a sharp increase in layoffs while jobs continue to bleed from the housing and finance sectors growth in service jobs remains robust and most other sectors remain afloat economists in the wsj com survey predict an average monthly gain of about nonfarm jobs over the next year which would keep incomes growing and keep consumers spending shoppers defied many forecasts in november opening their wallets despite concerns about the economy that suggests the credit crunch and housing declines havent hit consumers as hard as some analysts expected outside of housing consumers and businesses can borrow at low rates moreover people with the worst credit problems the ones least likely to get additional credit arent the biggest spenders the housing downturns pain will continue but has already done much of its damage to growth for much of this decade residential construction has been a significant driver of economic growth but since last year when home building began to tumble housings contribution has dropped substantially now the share of economic growth due to residential sector investment is so low that it has little room to shave gdp further one of the biggest questions hanging over the economy remains how far is the housing market from its bottom though many major markets are experiencing steep price declines much of the country is ok the s&amp p case shiller index a popular measure of home prices that has shown steep price declines has limited geographic coverage perhaps overstating the extent to which the housing sectors declines will weigh on consumers "the states that are having a hard time are where theres been a lot of speculation " says mark nielson chief economist at macroecon global advisors which sees economic growth at more than through next year "their economies probably will not do as well as the rest of the country " government spending remains strong and then there is the government not just washington but state and local governments spending by state and local governments is contributing of gdp growth this year and that is before an election year when officials will resist making cutbacks "state and local spending is kind of an unsung hero here " mr lavorgna says it tends to lag federal spending and should continue to perform well next year even if it slows in he says the odds of recession have risen and the economys skies are cloudy but there is a chance the skies will be sunnier by the middle of next year see related letters "letters to the editor whither
