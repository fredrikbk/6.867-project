americas stung in miami it also raises questions about whether mrs kirchner was acting in good faith last week when she met with mr chavezs sworn enemy in south america colombian president alvaro uribe to discuss the plight of french colombian hostage ingrid betancourt and others held by the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc argentina isnt conscientious about paying its debts but maybe thats about to change under freshly inaugurated president cristina kirchner two news items that broke last week suggest that her government may be running a hefty tab with president hugo chavez in venezuela and is earnestly trying to repay him the u s justice department alleged on wednesday that mrs kirchners recent election campaign was the destination for &# in cash shipped south in a suitcase from mr chavez in august if true it would confirm what many argentines have long suspected that argentina under former president nestor kirchner and now his wife has been leased out to the venezuelan strongman in much the same way that bolivia and nicaragua have come under mr chavezs influence this is grim not only for argentine democracy if members of the organization of american states are indeed on mr chavezs payroll it would explain why the washington based multilateral organization charged with defending democracy has been so timid with the anti democratic venezuelan president it also raises questions about whether mrs kirchner was acting in good faith last week when she met with mr chavezs sworn enemy in south america colombian president alvaro uribe to discuss the plight of french colombian hostage ingrid betancourt and others held by the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc mrs kirchner went on the offensive last week charging that the u s sting operation was "garbage " but the feds may have the goods recall that the bagman carrying the &# returned to his home in florida after being released by the argentine authorities the u s attorney in miami says that three venezuelans and an uruguayan acted as foreign agents when they traveled to the u s to try to silence him "in an effort to keep the lid on a burgeoning international scandal " given the nonchalance with which the smuggler approached his task it is not hard to fathom that the transaction was considered routine by venezuela and that he was only an unlucky one who got caught the argentine daily la nacion revealed last summer that venezuelan aircraft and personnel regularly land and bypass customs inspections at jorge newberry airport in buenos aires mrs kirchner would owe mr chavez a lot if he did indeed underwrite her campaign so perhaps that explains the pro chavez attitude she took last tuesday toward colombias hostage issue when she met with president uribe in buenos aires rather than endorse the geneva convention and as chilean president michelle bachelet did recently call for the farc to immediately release its victims without conditions mrs kirchner pressured the colombian head of state to be more forthcoming in other words she took the same line as mr chavez and the farc insisting that mr uribe is the barrier to progress mrs kirchner may have domestic political reasons for avoiding the subject of the geneva convention her government and her husbands before her relies on allies advisers and cabinet members who are former members of argentine terror groups that made a living from kidnapping in the s if the farc is guilty of violating the convention so too are many kirchneristas if she has a debt with mr chavez she now has an additional motivation for trying to place blame on mr uribe rather than the terrorists mr chavez makes no secret of his support for the farc or his enmity for mr uribe the farc leadership hangs out in caracas and runs its drugs through mr chavezs backyard if he wanted to free the hostages for purely humanitarian reasons he could have already done so the guerrillas need passage through venezuelan territory and could be brought to heel anytime mr chavez wants mr uribe may have made a big mistake by even considering a hostage negotiation with the farc the rebels have never suggested that they are interested in peace they want to trade their "political" captives police soldiers politicians and three american contractors for a strategic gain that will enhance the efficiency of their narcotics and kidnapping businesses in light of this reality mr uribe would have been better off sticking to a policy of no talks with terrorists but the colombian government is under intense pressure from french president nicolas sarkozy and hostage family members so he gambled on opening a dialogue he took an even bigger risk by agreeing to allow mr chavez to act as a negotiator the venezuelan president almost immediately violated the ground rules by attempting to talk directly with the military his goal was to secure the guerrillas no demand a new rebel territory guaranteed free of colombian forces mr uribe promptly and wisely fired the venezuelan "negotiator " but now he finds himself under renewed pressure from mrs kirchner to do more to satisfy the demands of the narcotraffickers according to local news reports in her meeting with mr uribe mrs kirchner showed no appreciation of colombias latest concession to the farc to allow an internationally observed demilitarized zone of square kilometers for days in order to exchange farc insurgents that the government holds for the hostages the farc has also ignored the offer nor does the argentine president seem interested in getting to the bottom of the "suitcase affair " instead an enraged mrs kirchner went before television cameras last week and played the gender card "this president may be a woman but she is not going to allow herself to be pressured " she said in reference to u s antipathy toward her friend mr chavez her attitude cant be too comforting to colombians men or women who live with the farc terror that mr chavez and now mrs kirchner want to appease
