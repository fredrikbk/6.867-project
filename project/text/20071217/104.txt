government might raise taxes after his mother died a few years ago mark larson "realized mortality" and came to a big decision he wanted to amass enough wealth to leave something behind for his children so he and his brother started investing but not in stocks or mutual funds instead they began buying properties like office buildings and retail space "with the stock market youre investing in faith " says the year old mr larson national director of the private capital investment group at real estate services firm grubb &amp ellis co "but with commercial real estate you can quantify the location quantify the rent and drive by and look at it every saturday to make sure its still there " more investors are following mr larsons logic as they think about retirement theyre looking to build nest eggs that could last or even years and commercial real estate seems like a stable investment compared to stocks for one thing commercial real estate delivers regular income whether from rent checks or dividends from a real estate investment trust or reit and the sector has traditionally kept pace with inflation and provided "sufficient risk adjusted returns " says grant conness a financial adviser at alternatives group a division of costa financial securities inc in hollywood fla indeed while the residential housing market is struggling commercial real estate is showing solid fundamentals in many markets with occupancies high increasing rent growth and supply under control on top of that commercial real estate has gotten increasingly sophisticated and transparent as an investment vehicle in the past years in part thats because of the emergence of the market for reits these publicly traded companies invest in real estate and pay out of their income as dividends to shareholders heres a look at some of the ways to invest in commercial property starting with some important caveats get some help investors who want to consider commercial real estate as an investment shouldnt try to go it alone many experts recommend finding a broker who can analyze regional markets how the various commercial property types are performing in those markets and the kind of rents these assets can capture at any given time its also important to work with an expert to figure out what kind of investment would make you feel most comfortable for instance an older property that needs renovation may be a riskier bet than a newer one that doesnt need much work says harvey green chief executive of marcus &amp millichap real estate investment services an investment real estate broker in encino calif unless you can find tenants to pay higher rent and cover the costs of renovation you may not be able to get a good enough return on your investment another example would be a strip shopping center with no anchor tenants which has a much higher risk level than a neighborhood center with a grocery store or drug store anchor tenant adds mr green finally bear in mind that commercial real estate like other types of real estate can go down in any particular location says michael kitces director of financial planning at pinnacle advisory group in columbia md the local economy might slow down big area employers might cut lots of workers and the government might raise taxes now lets look at some ways to buy property direct ownership the basic choice in property investing is whether youll invest directly in a property or do it through a third party vehicle buying a property directly offers a couple of big advantages you can deduct part of the purchase cost of the building from your taxes for many years and if the property goes up in value you dont have to share the gains with any partners this approach also means you can do a " exchange " this allows you to defer or sometimes avoid paying capital gains taxes when selling the property if you plan to use the money to buy another property of equal or greater value "as long as the investor keeps moving into another investment they virtually never have to pay the tax on their gain " says marsha slotten a las vegas based commercial real estate broker still the thought of managing tenants and dealing with building upkeep might scare off many baby boomers who are gearing up for retirement and are looking for a hassle free investment so many people hire a management company to deal with those headaches typically local management companies charge anywhere from to of the gross rent depending on the duties they perform larger commercial companies might charge between and when hiring a management company check out its references and see how well it is regarded locally for instance interview local vendors that have worked with the company such as plumbers painters or carpenters sponsored investment investors who dont have the money or inclination to go it alone can turn to sponsors who buy commercial properties on behalf of small investors for a fee in most cases you dont have to seek out a sponsor they typically market investment products directly to financial advisers who in turn present them to their clients as options to figure out if a sponsor is trustworthy you can check court or state records to see if the sponsor has had any problems you can also ask for references from investors who have done business with the sponsor kraig kast chief executive at atherton trust a provider of trustee and wealth management services in redwood shores calif offers another piece of advice "i would invest small &# to &# then if the results are there invest more over a period of time with that sponsor " there are a number of ways of investing with a sponsor one is tenants in common or tic ownership a tic typically involves a group of investors who each buys a fractional interest in a commercial property such as an office building the investors receive the benefits of ownership rental income and profit on any future sale but leave the day to day details to professional managers "tic properties are usually buildings that most small to midsize investors couldnt otherwise afford to purchase on their own " says mr conness of alternatives group experts say qualified individuals can invest in a tic with as little as &# one drawback of the tic is that once you invest youre probably locked in until the property is sold you could sell your fractional share but theres a limited market for such a purchase smaller investors can also team up with other investors to form a limited partnership usually theres a general partner who puts the partnership together with the help of an attorney and gets paid a fee for managing the property and a share of the profits says lou weller a principal at deloitte tax llp in san francisco whats the main distinction between the two options the big difference is that you can exchange into or out of a tic interest in a exchange but in an lp the limited partnership cant exchange its interest in such a fashion also in a tic structure investors each get a deed to their share of the property but with a limited partnership the property title is held by the lp entity this leads to differences in the legal consequences says mr weller if someone owns a tic interest directly he or she can be sued directly but the lp structure itself limits legal exposure of the limited partners a third type of sponsored investment vehicle is the reit if youre put off by the recent volatility in actively traded reits you might consider public nontraded reits these offer all the benefits of regular reits such as monthly distributions but they dont trade actively so theyre often much more stable a reits monthly distributions often are about the same as income from tic or lp offerings triple net lease properties finally there are "triple net lease properties " which you can buy as an individual investor or as part of a group in these deals typically used for retail office and industrial properties leased to a single tenant the lessee handles expenses such as taxes insurance and maintenance the appeal for tenants is that they typically get a long term lease sometimes years with limited increases in rent the advantage for owners is that all they have to do is pick up the check from the mailbox says grubb &amp elliss mr larson and because the tenant usually holds a long term lease owners feel they can count on the income for years mr conness adds "the ability to relate to a well known tenant like walgreens gives many investors some piece of mind " a caveat because of the long leases net lease properties can be very illiquid "be cautious about tying your money up in an investment vehicle that is not liquid if theres a risk youll need the money sooner rather than later " says mr kitces
