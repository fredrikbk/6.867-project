money illusions groucho marx once asked "who are you going to believe me or your own eyes " too bad groucho doesnt work at either the federal reserve or on wall street where economists have been predicting that slower economic growth would lead to a slowdown in inflation groucho marx once asked "who are you going to believe me or your own eyes " too bad groucho doesnt work at either the federal reserve or on wall street where economists have been predicting that slower economic growth would lead to a slowdown in inflation they should have believed their own eyes as any american who has shopped for groceries or gasoline can tell you prices are rising that was confirmed last friday in the official figures for november with overall consumer prices jumping from a month earlier that was the largest monthly gain in two years and higher than a year ago the report for producer prices was equally as alarming a day earlier rising the producer price index is up in the past months on a seasonally adjusted basis some analysts continue to ignore all this and focus on so called "core" inflation which excludes food and energy that is cold comfort to americans who devote increasingly larger chunks of their monthly budget to food and energy one lesson of the past few years is that relying too much on core inflation data as the fed has done until recently can be a dangerous mistake we couldnt help but notice that former fed chairman alan greenspan a longtime "core" watcher was quoted last week as saying it is now a less reliable guide to monetary policy not surprisingly equity markets fell friday on the inflation news the same markets that only a week earlier had been begging for easier money from the fed anyone who recalls the s understands that inflation is very bad for stocks in general though of course price sensitive shares like commodities can do very well for a while if nothing else the inflation figures should remind us that there is no free lunch for wall street in continuing its cheerleading for easier money it should also remind us once again that inflation doesnt rise or fall along with economic growth inflation is a monetary phenomenon and reflects the supply and demand for currency created by central banks we learned in the s that rising prices can co exist with slower growth and we learned in the s or should have that rapid growth can co exist with falling levels of inflation those are lessons too many people seem to have forgotten this decade which is why the fed now has both less credibility and less leeway to ease money amid the housing recession and mortgage mess if politicians want to help the economy theyll stop relying on the monetary delusion and instead focus on fiscal policy specifically a tax cut see related letter "letters to the editor get on your marx" dec see related letter "letters to the editor discard the rotten core " wsj dec
