ambac financial group inc however moodys shifted mbias outlook to "negative" from "stable " suggesting the slumping u s mortgage market still poses risks for the bond market moodys investors service sent a reassuring note to fretful markets about bond insurers that guarantee trillions of dollars in debt while signaling caution about challenges facing that industry and investors in bonds they cover the debt rating firm said friday that it was affirming its highest rating triple a on bond insurer mbia inc the largest u s bond insurer by outstanding value of bonds insured the moodys corp unit also affirmed the top rating of insurer ambac financial group inc however moodys shifted mbias outlook to "negative" from "stable " suggesting the slumping u s mortgage market still poses risks for the bond market it maintained ambacs "stable" outlook those decisions are likely to be welcomed today by bond issuers and investors alike if an insurers rating is downgraded the bonds it insures are also likely to be downgraded and lose value bond insurance is a linchpin of modern credit markets the insurers guarantee the principal and interest payments on more than &# trillion in debt including securities backed by mortgages mbia and ambac alone make up about of the bond insurance market according to moodys ratings are vital to bondholders which can include pension funds investment banks and hedge funds downgrades may infect credit markets with further uncertainty but concerns are likely to persist about potential problems bond insurers face wall streets most vocal critic of the bond insurers bill ackman of new york hedge fund pershing square capital management llc described the moves by moodys as "creeping incrementalism " the ratings firm doesnt want "to be the causal factor for these companies blowing up theyre giving them yet another warning " he said "its a shot across the bow " mr ackman who has said that his hedge fund stands to make some &# billion for its investors if most of the guarantors go out of business predicts that investors loss of confidence in many of the guarantors despite their triple a ratings will prevent them from writing much new cash generating business in the first quarter that and other factors mean some of the biggest bond insurers likely will need to be downgraded he predicts moodys also said friday that it was placing the triple a ratings of financial guaranty insurance co and xl capital assurance inc on review for possible downgrades it said the securities guaranteed by those firms and that moodys rates also were put under review for possible downgrades xl capital is a security capital assurance ltd unit as with mbia moodys also affirmed the ratings of cifg guaranty while changing the rating outlook to "negative " the revised outlook doesnt affect the ratings on securities the firm insures said ted collins a moodys group managing director a cifg spokesman said the firm is "pleased to have the ongoing support of" its controlling shareholders and added "we will take the necessary steps to return to stable outlook as soon as possible " mr collins said the firm is "trying to position our ratings appropriately given the information that we have " he said that putting a rating on review for possible downgrade means moodys thinks the rating could be lowered in the "near term " while an outlook change could lead to a review for possible downgrade but the time frame is "typically somewhat longer " an mbia spokesman said yesterday that business written in any one quarter is "irrelevant" to its ratings because it adds very little to revenue earnings or surplus in a statement friday mbia chief executive officer gary dunton said the firm is "pleased" with the affirmation of its rating and "confident that we will promptly implement the remaining components of the capital plan presented to moodys and return to stable outlook " both mbia and ambac have announced moves this month to increase their capital which may help protect their triple a ratings this month a private equity firm agreed to provide as much as &# billion to mbia which said at the time that it was also considering additional capital options ambac struck a deal under which it bought reinsurance for a &# billion portfolio a &# billion capital infusion from controlling shareholders of cifgs french parent was disclosed a few weeks ago fgic corp the parent of financial guaranty insurance co said it "has developed and is actively pursuing a comprehensive plan to enhance its capital resources " and said the plan is meant "to create an adequate cushion in excess of" what moodys requires for a triple a rating "all these companies are actively pursuing capital plans of various forms " mr collins said of the four firms whose ratings outlook was switched to negative or whose ratings were placed under review for possible downgrade if problems in the mortgage market are worse than expected if for instance the number of people who cannot make payments on those mortgages rises sharply bond insurers may under certain circumstances have to step in and pay bond holders as the obligations come due as part of its review moodys examined how bond insurers might be affected under difficult circumstances for mortgage loans made in for instance it used a cumulative loss rate for this stress test for mortgage loans made in moodys used a lower rate and for loans made in it used a higher rate mr collins said fears about potential claims bond insurers could face have already cost some of the firms dearly this year in terms of falling stock prices mbia and ambac shares for instance have both lost more than half of their value this year
