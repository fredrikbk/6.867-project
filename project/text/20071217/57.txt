had a perfect attendance record at brunswick this year there is another downside chiefs of finance technology marketing and compliance can cause trouble in the boardroom by meddling in the day to day management of their expertise spurring complaints from executives michele coleman mayes was general counsel at pitney bowes inc when she became a director of assurant inc shortly after the new york insurer went public in she faced resistance from certain assurant executives over her proposals to strengthen the companys ethics program and to give the board more authority over foreign expansion "they wanted to strangle me over some of my ideas " she says though several were later adopted in july the securities and exchange commission announced it might issue civil complaints against five top assurant executives as part of an investigation of insurance industry practices the board created a special committee led by ms mayes placed three executives on administrative leave and fired the other two ms mayes plunged into the new role spending long hours at assurant but she didnt always see eye to eye about the probe with jerome atkinson assurants chief compliance officer and a chum from law school the committee wanted many staffers to sign a form certifying that they had turned over all relevant documents to the company and could be fired if they didnt cooperate but officials refused to distribute the form "it would have been inefficient and redundant given assurants culture " a person familiar with the situation says "outside board members dont always know a companys culture as well as management " executives say directors received all necessary documents ms mayes struggled to walk a fine line during the internal investigation "you have to ask yourself have you usurped management so much that you made them ineffective &amp nbsp " she says assurant directors approved her committees page report in october a company spokesman declined to discuss the contents but praised the directors "extraordinarily valuable service " ms mayes quit the assurant board last month to avoid a potential conflict of interest after she became general counsel of insurer allstate corp she says that shes not immediately interested in another board seat but that the assurant experience taught her a lot about how to be an effective director including the importance of challenging the status quo "the more perspectives you have the better the exchange " she adds certain boards try to improve the chances that non ceo managers will succeed as directors the board of asbury automotive group inc did extra homework during a recent hunt for its first such director "we wanted an actively employed up and coming executive" who could add a lot of value says janet m clarke a director of the car dealer chain she and four board colleagues each interviewed candidates posing detailed questions about prospects work commitments they rejected one promising senior marketing executive because he reported to the ceo often traveled abroad and lacked corporate board experience "i said to him i dont think you have enough control of your schedule " ms clarke recalls in october the asbury board picked juanita t james chief communications officer for pitney bowes she had spent years as a rouse co director before accepting the seat ms james needed approval from the ceo the finance chief and a board committee at pitney bowes ms james whose prior management experience includes years at time warner inc is already making her mark at asbury during her first board meeting this fall "she had a big seat at the table because people were listening to what she was saying " ms clarke recollects "she picked up very quickly on some very critical issues involving organizational structure " ms clarke adds "shes proving to be a significant contributor "
