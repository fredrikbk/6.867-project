real time the airborne net internet access could be handy on airlines but it also removes a digital age sanctuary online edition granted net access would be welcome in those dreadful moments after the pilots come on with his inevitable aw shucks chuck yeager voice to announce that ladies and gentlemen air traffic control has asked us to hold here because of congestion on the ground we apologize for the delay and well give you updates when we know em airplane travel long ago lost the feeling of exclusivity it once commanded today planes are basically faster buses if highways were reserved for super expensive cars and certain bus lines with the lack of competition allowing them to charge too much money for bad service internet access is coming as was inevitable to airplanes last week jetblue started offering email and instant messaging albeit on a single plane american virgin and alaska airlines are expected to roll out online access including web surfing next year qantas already has it as you might expect jetblues current plans are to offer the service for free while the other airlines intend to charge for it as so often happens with technology on the march this seems like a mixed blessing a certain breed of road warrior will welcome the chance to bump up productivity and do away with the prospect of hours in which theyre unreachable but others among us including some more reluctant road warriors will mourn the elimination of another sanctuary from the ceaseless buzz of data and connectedness assuming were not too busy twittering and googling ourselves at feet of course granted net access would be welcome in those dreadful moments after the pilots come on with his inevitable aw shucks chuck yeager voice to announce that ladies and gentlemen air traffic control has asked us to hold here because of congestion on the ground we apologize for the delay and well give you updates when we know em in that situation a quick email would let those greeting you know not to go to the airport just yet reschedule dinner or move that meeting without having to spend a fortune on the seatback phone if youre a luckless flier stuck in one of those trapped on the plane and cant get off disasters that seems to strike down one airline per blizzard you could google executives to call and scream at and hey its better than tv right right now the airlines plans dont include enough bandwidth for more robust web endeavors but time will surely change that too those two hour ground holds could go more quickly if you were playing "world of warcraft " and dedicated sports fans wouldnt have to miss a game whether theyre garden variety mlb tv subscribers or members of the quasi secret society of nfl fans who tap into signals from european tv which isnt to say everything will be perfect once the net takes to the skies after all my airborne computing experience usually goes something like this  drag laptop out from under seat open it unhappily scooch it around on tray table before wedging it in place  frantically try to remember how to mute speaker before windows start up tone deafens neighbors  pray person in row ahead of me doesnt recline and break laptop screen  work slowly and inefficiently until i realize im down to of battery capacity  start working frantically and inefficiently  snack and soda arrive ponder how to eat and drink without spilling coke into laptop  put laptop on lap burn self  laptop shuts down i know this will improve as net functions become more commonplace on mobile devices but some of us will still be stuck with the woes of using a laptop in coach making that a better experience would require infrastructure improvements i have trouble imagining starting with outlets watch those cords and bigger tray tables and seats and what about phone calls the airlines have talked about not allowing voice communications but once sufficient bandwidth arrives more travelers will turn to voip as an alternative to cellphones what lucky flight attendant gets tasked with enforcing a ban on net enabled calls then theres the inevitable regret in all this that one of the few remaining places we cant be reached will be gone a certain ambivalence has always accompanied each digital advance the more bandwidth we command the more we sometimes worry about drowning in an ever deeper sea of information the more places we can communicate the fewer places we have to escape airplane travel long ago lost the feeling of exclusivity it once commanded today planes are basically faster buses if highways were reserved for super expensive cars and certain bus lines with the lack of competition allowing them to charge too much money for bad service to borrow the old george and tammy line by now were all the old chevrolet set if anything the appeal of airplane travel is that its one of the few remaining parts of digital age life that feels slow and anti technological an odd reversal from the jet age days in which we dressed up to fly on the airplane we have to sit more or less still sometimes for a long time turn our cellphones off and sever those net connections if youre flying alone and not inclined to chit chat with your rowmates those few hours of enforced monasticism can be a strange experience with the buzz of communication and information muffled you may find yourself reading more intently than you have for a long time or feel your thoughts wander off in odd directions it can be disorienting and also kind of welcome you can argue that such intervals of internal quiet are still there for anyone who wants them after all its not like well be forced to use the net while airborne but this underestimates the steady pressure technology brings once were reachable in the air people will expect to be able to reach us once we can work on airplanes doing so will become the norm and even those of us who dont have to work may well find ourselves idling away our hours emailing and chatting and searching no conscious choice will have been made rather as with so many other parts of life we will have forgotten that things used to be different are you for or against internet access on flights do you like the feeling of escape that comes when nobody can reach you or do you think the benefits of being able to get in contact with people while airborne outweigh any inconveniences if you flew on an airline that offered internet access would you be able to resist it how do you feel about net access on flights do you like the feeling of escape that comes when nobody can reach you or do you think the benefits of being able to get in touch ouweigh any regrets if you flew on an airline that offered net access would you be able to resist it join me and other online journal readers in an ongoing discussion on the real time forum or write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear real time will return monday dec have a good holiday
